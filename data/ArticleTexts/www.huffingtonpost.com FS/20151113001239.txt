{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyThe distinction between Sanders and Clinton as being between \"socialism\" and \"capitalism\" is misleading, for the real debate is about what type of capitalism the candidates favor. There is a far-reaching difference between Sanders\u0027s social democratic version of capitalism and Clinton\u0027s neoliberal version. This difference is what was really beneath their disagreement in the first debate, about Denmark, which -- along with Sweden and Norway, the other countries mentioned in the debate by Senator Sanders -- embody the social democratic model: a type of highly regulated market economy that is characterized by strong labor unions, a generous welfare state, vigorous public institutions, and relatively high taxes and public expenditures.My dad took off most of his vacation time for the year to act in Master of None. So I\u0027m really relieved this all worked out. On Tuesday night, after we did Colbert together he said: \"This is all fun and I liked acting in the show, but I really just did it so I could spend more time with you.\"Writer, Director, Actor, Stand-Up ComedianIf Hillary Clinton wants to light up the country in either the general election or the primary, she needs to take a leadership role -- not a lip service role -- in a basic, in-the-guts overhaul of how politics works in this country.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarThe Boys \u0026 Girls Club has a longstanding partnership with Coca-Cola. This was a great way for the company to establish brand loyalty at an early age, in an era when no one could have imagined what a scourge soda would become.Author, Producer, AdvocateThe fundamental reason that I was accepted into an MD-PhD program is because I was given a chance. And yet at one point in my visa application process, the chance of obtaining legal residence became non-existent.Undocumented medical student\"Armed and fabulous\" could be a punchline if it weren\u0027t such a dangerous premise. We agree that guns are a women\u0027s issue, but for very different reasons than the NRA. Guns are a women\u0027s issue, simply put, because batterers with guns kill women in America at a rate higher than any other industrial country.Associate professor of nursing at the University of Virginia School of NursingProfessor of nursing and the Anna D. Wolf Chair at Johns Hopkins School of NursingPeople aren\u0027t going to be dragged reluctantly into tomorrow\u0027s low-carbon economy, looking back mournfully over their shoulder at the familiar world they\u0027re leaving behind. It has to be a world that is so enticing, so technologically cutting-edge and so affordable that they will demand the benefits of a sustainable world.Founder and Director of Forum for the FutureWhile it may feel like it has been going on forever, the 2016 election is one year from now. The presidency is at stake, of course. Control of the Senate, of state legislatures, and even (theoretically) of the House of Representatives is up in the air. But in basic ways, the very integrity of our electoral system is on the ballot, too, next year.President of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of LawIt\u0027s 2015 and much of the media seem to accept, still, that LGBT people can be talked about this way at an event attended by presidential candidates and that it\u0027s not news.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostI don\u0027t see police officers as the enemy. And let me also be clear: I am not a victim. I don\u0027t feel that the world owes me anything, and I know that I need to work hard and play nice in order to have a happy life. But why do I still get harassed by some police officers for no justifiable reason?Actor, writer, director and hand-talkerDespite the overwhelming evidence that my daughter is a girl, the institution that is charged with educating and enlightening our children was only concerned with her body. The district therefore did not allow her in the girls\u0027 locker room.Anyone who is pregnant -- celebrity or otherwise -- is doing something very publicly, whether she likes it or not. And singling out any of us, including Kim Kardashian, for a by-the-numbers weight gain commentary is shameful at best.Executive Editor, Huffington Post VoicesI had some really great times at Mizzou and I do not regret going there, however it came with a price and a message. The message was that we were not truly wanted there, so instead of in actually making strides towards having an all inclusive school, they gave us just enough to exist within it. They gave us a campus within a campus.Culture loving, world traveling, writer, poet and photographer from St. Louis, Mo.Here are tips for spouses who, while not actually contemplating a divorce, may want to be as fortified as possible if ever that unfortunate day arrives.Partner, Matrimonial Group at the law firm of Blank Rome LLPPartner, Matrimonial Group at the law firm of Blank Rome LLPIn my view, universities have a deep obligation to protect and preserve the freedom of expression. That is, most fundamentally, at the very core of what makes a university a university.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe conditions seem perfect for a real political debate between two candidates who differ from each other on many key issues.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAs a Black trans woman, I am used to unfair and discriminatory treatment, but this was extra upsetting because we were paying customers at a hotel and on our way to a funeral. I felt like I had no rights.Proud transgender woman from Illinois studying cosmetologyThe asterisk involves the 25 percent of seats set aside for representatives of the military. This bloc also holds veto power over any constitutional changes. And, according to the constitution, Aung San Suu Kyi can\u0027t be president.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogIt is important to talk about rape culture. It is often between the lines of many narratives. It walks side by side with the notion that men are unable to control their instincts.Journalist, mother, feministThe current student protests may have been provoked by a controversy over Halloween costumes, but they have much deeper roots in Yale\u0027s history and culture, and they have made it clear to us that institutional racism continues to be a powerful force at Yale, as it was when we were students.Despite their influence at the polls, black women\u0027s concerns are undervalued in contemporary political campaigns. Few presidential candidates have been vocal about black women\u0027s vulnerability to state-sanctioned violence. Candidates who ignore black women voters do so at their own peril.Historian, Writer, and ProfessorIf your allying with the LGBT community began and ended with a rainbow-infused Facebook profile picture, it was a posture. Acting as an ally, however, is rarely a comforting move.Executive Director of Progressive Christians UnitingAmid the defeats, corruption, and disappointments, there lurks a kind of success. After all, every disaster in which the U.S. military takes part only brings more bounty to the Pentagon.Editor, TomDispatch.comWherever you look in the chaos of Egypt today, the finger points at one man Sisi, and one institution the Egyptian army. It is he and it, not \"foreign hands\" which are at the epicenter of the country\u0027s instability.Editor, Middle East EyeA conflict over land can be settled by dividing the land -- but a clash of cultures can only end in absolute victory for one side and total defeat for the other. Thus, Netanyahu offers a prognosis for endless conflict.Author, \u0027Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\u0027If you\u0027re living on the edge of famine, you may not be able to afford a squash pot, or even seeds. But when you\u0027re an American elitist, eager to reject the idea that a vitamin-fortified crop could rescue children from the tragic effects of malnutrition, you go to the edge of reason and fall off.Mother, writer, and environmental activistCooking teacher, food policy writer in Orland Park, IL. She\u0027s been published in WSJ, Chicago Tribune, Forbes, National Review and The Hill.Military operations resulted in an economic recession and deepened local infighting. Saudi Arabia has also lost soldiers in battle and faces increased retaliatory attacks. To avoid further bloodshed, it would be wise for Saudi Arabia to consider using diplomacy rather than facing the Houthis head-on.Researcher at the Near Eastern Department. University of California, Berkeley.This trend of catastrophization is so dangerous -- instead of spreading awareness of racial, gender and economic inequality, it shifts the focus toward policing speech and shaming perceived transgressors. As liberals, we need to remember is that this behavior violates two fundamental assumptions of our ideology.The conversation no one else is having.Under the glare of the fluorescent lights, and against the contrast of the white paper towel, the bug took its full, wretched, kinetic form. It was phase 44 all over again. I gagged.Mother, wife, friend, attorney, blogger at www.smartycaro.com.The text of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) finally became accessible to the public. The result predictably values the rights of corporations over the needs of workers and fails to address the the utter failure of the parties to uphold their commitments to respect workers\u0027 rights.Executive Director, International Labor Rights ForumWhy are children a target for identity thieves? It\u0027s called \"runway.\" A child\u0027s Social Security number is pristine. There is no reason for a minor to use it in connection with any financial or credit-related transaction before reaching the age of 18. Consequently, there\u0027s been no need for them, or their parents, to check their credit.Author of Swiped.
