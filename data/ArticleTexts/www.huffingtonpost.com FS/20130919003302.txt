{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressThe White House has been full-court pressing on the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis, making the case for all it\u0027s done to ameliorate the after-effects of the economic collapse. Most of this is vintage 2012-era stump speeches: the country was pulled back from the brink of a second Great Depression, the automobile industry is alive, banks are lending again, laws have been passed to prevent future crises, but more work needs to be done because too many people are still out of work, et cetera. There\u0027s plenty to nitpick there, but the biggest and most tenacious nit is the Obama administration\u0027s weird insistence on bragging about the wrong thing.Comments (630)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThis week should remove any doubt about whether markets are highly dependent on the Fed. They sure are. Indeed, you could not have constructed better conditions for a controlled experiment. Yet, ironically, the medium-term investment stakes are now higher.CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggeriOS7 generally eliminates the arbitrary and confusing elements of the iOS user experience that have no business cluttering up a touch screen device.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe chance for our kids to live a better life -- what was that called again? Oh, yeah: The American Dream. That\u0027s not just a dream about income, although it\u0027s certainly that. It\u0027s also a dream about fairness. Most of all, it\u0027s a dream of opportunity.Comments (463)Arianna HuffingtonAs the UN General Assembly begins a new session and leaders from all over the world come together to tackle our biggest problems, we\u0027re starting conversations at HuffPost on a handful of big initiatives that focus on ways to improve people\u0027s lives in the developing world.CommentsKelly MacLeanStand up comic, actress, writer @thekellymacleanShe rings me up for $313. I resist the urge to unwrap and swallow whole another $6 truffle in protest. Barely. Instead, I reach for my wallet, flash her a quiet smile and say, \"Namaste.\"Comments (2,108)Jeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027This is not a matter of anything Verizon cannot do. This is a matter of what Verizon will not do. And that is what makes this a violation of FCC regulations and Verizon\u0027s assurances.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027When it comes to accuracy, if you put a horoscope on one end and a heart monitor on the other, the MBTI falls about halfway in between.Comments (34)Denise JollyWriter, Performer and Artist EducatorThe active practice of loving myself exactly as I am is radical self love. It is loving all 311 pounds of my glorious body out loud in public. It is engaging, challenging and dismantling the story that I am lacking desirability because of the size of my body.Comments (139)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityAs more facts emerge in the aftermath of the horrific Navy Yard shooting, issues relating to guns, mental illness and access to sensitive locations by armed unstable individuals have resurfaced.Comments (75)Gill HornbyAuthor, JournalistA mean girl is not, really, one who hurts her lover. No. A mean girl is one who hurts her friends. The best ones in literature are not the creations of men, therefore. It is the women writers who really understand the grief we females can inflict upon each other.Comments (18)Alicia BayerBlogger, A Magical ChildhoodWe are such a competitive culture that even our preschoolers have become trophies and bragging rights. Childhood shouldn\u0027t be a race.Comments (144)John MichaelFreelance Writer \u0026 Perpetual StudentMore than any other demographic, seniors are poised to be the biggest pot users in America should cannabis be legalized. It\u0027s law-abiding adults who will begin using pot in greater numbers, and the associated lameness of watching their parents ripping a bong will, if anything, probably decrease teen use.Comments (102)Mark WahlbergActor, Producer and PhilanthropistMost high school dropouts don\u0027t end up with successful careers in Hollywood. I was lucky. Compared with high school graduates, dropouts are more likely to be unemployed, in poor health, living in poverty or on public assistance.Comments (93)Asha RangappaAssociate Dean, Yale Law SchoolThe pushback is heartening and well-intentioned, but misses what ought to be the real shame target: India. After all, despite being a country of almost a billion people, India has left it to America to crown the first Indian beauty queen who looks... well, Indian.Comments (123)David MacarayLabor columnist, playwright and authorHard as it may be to believe, in 1939, the University of Chicago abruptly dropped its football program, citing as its reason the astonishing fact that the sport had evolved to the point where it was becoming a distraction to both students and faculty.Comments (47)Dave PruettFormer NASA researcher; computational scientist; emeritus professor of mathematics, James Madison University; author, \u0027Reason and Wonder\u0027So, why do I -- both bald and gray -- Occupy? For starters, I\u0027ve come to love my fellow Occupiers. They\u0027re the salt of the earth: the most passionate, savvy, and pure-hearted people I\u0027ve ever met.Comments (11)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe real dirty secret of food stamps is that the primary beneficiaries are often giant corporations who pay their employees poverty wages, counting on food stamps, Medicaid and other forms of government assistance as indirect subsidies to their wealthy stock holders.Comments (70)Daryl HannahActress and activistMy stance against the boondoggle that is the Keystone XL pipeline has been a stand to protect us from exacerbating the effects of the climate crisis. We are already experiencing its force, in the form of killer floods, droughts, massive fires and super storm catastrophes.Comments (91)David H. Bailey and Jonathan M. BorweinIf publishers cave to pressure of this sort and modify their textbooks accordingly, then, because of the sheer size of the Texas K-12 educational system, these changes might well propagate throughout the U.S. and potentially elsewhere. In short, this is not just a Texas matter.CommentsJohn KlugeCo-Founder and Chief Disruption Officer, Toilet HackersYes, improved sanitation has improved the lives of billions of people all over the world, and it\u0027s important to note that success. But we need to make some course corrections. The stakes are just too high. Leaving billions of people to live with \"improved sanitation\" that includes untreated sewage--that\u0027s an economic, environmental, and humanitarian catastrophe.CommentsSteven WeberActor, wise-assWhat if the law-abiding and god-fearing gun owners actually led the way to limit access to guns by those bad, lethal apples?Comments (197)Carolyn S. MilesPresident \u0026 CEO, Save the ChildrenMillions of people in impoverished countries are alive today because a midwife was by their side when they gave birth, or they were vaccinated as infants by a nurse, or because their families learned from a community health worker to adopt healthy behaviors like breastfeeding, hand washing, birth spacing, and sleeping under a mosquito net.CommentsKim StaglianoAuthor House of Cards \u0026 All I Can HandleMy karate training has trimmed my figure and bolstered my confidence. Hmmm, maybe can be a MILF at 50? Or at least a, Mom In Line to Fight. Osu!Comments (81)Thomas McKennaEditorial Fellow at The Huffington PostWhat\u0027s interesting about the life and times of Johnny Football is how thoroughly he upends every cliche that is heretofore accepted when it comes to the relationship a football quarterback is supposed to have between his persona and performance.Comments (46)Kristin Rowe-FinkbeinerExecutive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgMoms care for our kids every day. Don\u0027t we have the right to expect our representatives in Congress to care for our nation, and take up the challenge of doing the hard work of substituting automatic budget cuts for a fair and balanced budget?CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027One of the most deceptive ideas continuously sounded by the Right is that the \"free market\" is natural and inevitable, existing outside and beyond government. So whatever inequality or insecurity it generates is beyond our control.Comments (1,672)Budget TravelYour source for vacation inspiration, travel deals, and expert travel tips.Even the most meticulously planned trip is subject to snafus, but with a little insider know-how, you can avoid making the common mistakes that can derail a vacation. Stick to these guidelines and your trip will be memorable not for lost luggage but for the thrill of discovering a new place.Comments (185)Wendy Woods and Jay WinstenMore than $126 billion in annual financing will be on the table when world leaders and advocates gather at the United Nations on September 25 to kick into high gear what is expected to be a highly contentious, two-year process of negotiations to set international development priorities for a fifteen-year period starting in 2015.CommentsJoanna MontgomeryWife, mother, survivor, BRCA1 positiveThose of us who either opted to have mastectomies as a preventative measure, or had mastectomies as a life-saving measure, aren\u0027t excited about our \"new boobs.\" In truth, we\u0027ll never be the same. We see ourselves differently now when we look in the mirror, because we are different, inside as well as outside.Comments (519)Jeff MadrickRoosevelt Institute Senior Fellow; author, \u0027Age of Greed\u0027The stock and bond markets should not be the only ones rejoicing at Larry Summers\u0027s withdrawal from consideration to run the Federal Reserve. The nation\u0027s workers should, too. Janet Yellen, the remaining frontrunner for the position, is no wimp on inflation.Comments (45)Richard M. Weinberg, 2013.18.09David H.
