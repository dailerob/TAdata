And while the FBI is attempting to be very clear that this is a one-off request, there is no chance that it is. This will not be the last horrific event whose possible resolution could be on a smart phone. There will be many government agencies that, many times in the future, point to Apple\u0027s compliance as a precedent. Once this happens, we all roll down that slippery slope of lost privacy together. Speech can only be free when it is protected. We are only free when we can say what we feel we must, privately or publicly. We have a right to protect our speech from those, domestic or otherwise, who may watch or monitor us.

A world leader maintained a private email server that stored top secret information.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Co-founder of Credit.com and IDT911Donald Trump has never met a wall he doesn\u0027t love. He believes in border walls, in gated communities, in structures and policies that separate \"us\" from \"them\" - especially when \"them\" can be defined as immigrants or people of color or the poor.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersBecause of a horrific lie, my life will never be the same.

He has never put in the kind of grass roots work that active Democrats do to help other Democrats. He doesn\u0027t care about building the party up, only about changing it.Playwright and retired Political Science Professor; former Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityWe have all met certain precocious children that learn tremendously quickly, read from an early age, and display advanced vocabulary.

Download \"5 Ways to Nurture Your Young Scientist\" at http://melaniefineonline.comThe adulation by admirers of Justice Antonin Scalia over his alleged role as a conservative constitutional steward who applied neutral, nonpartisan principles, is pure myth. While promoted by conservative ideologues who fawn over Justice Scalia\u0027s flamboyant jurisprudence, holding him up as an icon for conservative principles, is simply hard to take.Professor of Law, PaceAn Israeli-Palestinian peace deal would inject a huge dose of stability into the Middle East as well as providing a compelling example of how it is possible to resolve even the toughest issues through negotiation rather than through violence and warfare.Author, \u0027Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\u0027While I encourage everyone and anyone to follow their dreams, I\u0027m still a realist at the end of the day.
