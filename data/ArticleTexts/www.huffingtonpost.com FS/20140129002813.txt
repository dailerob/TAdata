{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonOlá from Brazil. I\u0027m here for the launch of the Brasil Post, in partnership with the Abril Group, one of Latin America\u0027s legendary media companies. For more than half a century, Abril has been telling the story of Brazil, in the pages of iconic magazines like Veja, Claudia, and Exame, and in its growing portfolio of online publications. Brazilians are social by nature, both online and off, making Brazil the perfect place for The Huffington Post to expand our platform, which is all about conversation and engagement. Brazil in 2014 is a country at once facing big challenges and brimming with opportunity, and our partnership with Abril positions the Brasil Post to combine the best of the old and the best of the new in order to tell the stories that matter most in Brazil -- and just as important, to help Brazilians tell their stories themselves.Comments (35)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The question is whether President Obama is prepared to talk about inequality in a way that gets to the core of the problem as opposed to just clipping away at the edges. It\u0027s a safe bet that we will see the latter.Comments (57)Steve EllsFounder, Chairman and Co-CEO of Chipotle Mexican GrillMultiple national surveys have been conducted about GMO labeling and the consumer\u0027s right to know what\u0027s in our food. The results have been fairly consistent: more than 90% of Americans are in favor of knowing when they are eating foods make with genetically modified ingredients.Comments (8)Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorIn the State of the Union tonight, President Obama is going to call for a national minimum wage of $10.10. Then the Republicans will say that\u0027d be a huge disaster that would make the Washington Monument fall over, Mt. Rushmore explode, etc. But here\u0027s what neither will tell you.Comments (16)Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryPete Seeger, 94, folk singer and peace and justice advocate has died, but the spirit of what his life and his music meant lives on. Americans have been less afraid of each other, and of speaking the truth to power, because he lived and sang and marched.Comments (13)Ahmed Shihab-EldinEmmy-Nominated Producer/Host, @HuffPostLiveIt\u0027s not easy coming back home to America when your name is Ahmed. I want to look forward to returning home from a trip abroad, but thanks to my name or as the TSA officer put it -- my \"profile\" -- I\u0027ve come to dread it.CommentsClif DickensGraphic DesignerComments (61)John KerryU.S. Secretary of StateHolocaust Remembrance Day calls us to condemn anti-Semitism in every form -- whether it\u0027s the disturbing rise of xenophobic and anti-Semitic parties in Europe or the uptick of violence against Jewish people anywhere in the world.CommentsKen ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansIf you decide to get your exercise through the CrossFit program, it\u0027s important to know that the motivation that comes from the \"communal aspect\" of CrossFit can become very dangerous if taken to the extreme. Too hard and too fast isn\u0027t a healthy strategy.CommentsShelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50Last weekend, I did something radical. Not radical as in going from blonde to brunette to pink and then back to blonde again. But radical nonetheless. I spent an entire evening compiling contact information for all the parents of my 13-year-old daughter\u0027s closest friends.CommentsGlenn Paul ManionBand Member/Founder, Squeaky CleanHere are the two points about Pete\u0027s career that are especially relevant to musicians trying to build their career in 2014.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistEarlier this month, I shared Martha Stewart\u0027s recollections of the single piece of advice that would ultimately shape her career. Today, we hear from CNN\u0027s Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour, who reveals how even the harshest of words can inspire us to realize our dreams.CommentsJames P. HoffaGeneral President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersAt a time when more elected officials are turning their attention to income inequality in this country, increasing corporate tax breaks is no way to address it. Workers and their families are struggling to make ends meet. Communities are broken.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027\"The transformation of the world, which many of us long to see, requires the changing of frameworks, ethics, and, most of all, our decisions; and that will not happen without taking risks, a true leap of faith.\"CommentsJohn FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThe lumbering aircraft carrier known as the United States should be executing a pivot that lives up to its name: a shift from the martial to the pacific. Instead, it\u0027s just roiling the waters and leaving instability in its wake.CommentsJonathan ByrdMusician, songwriter, veteran, North Carolina preacher\u0027s sonPete Seeger was bigger than music. He was John Henry. He was Odysseus. He was Gabriel. He will not be contained in a thousand obituaries today, however hard we write.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesLGBT activists are making it clear that American companies can no longer get away with tacitly supporting foreign regimes that are brutalizing LGBT people. The backlash against such companies is probably only just beginning and will last long after Sochi.Comments (140)Daphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstThe current review process is an improvement over the old one, in that the detainee is now assigned two \"personal representatives\" to help him. But as in Afghanistan, neither is a lawyer or trained advocate. And neither has a budget to do any real investigation of the case.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027What is alarming is the depth of detail, as well as the breadth of the information, gleaned from the ubiquitous mobile phone apps, including political affiliation and gender preferences, geographical location, an extensive network of one\u0027s friends and even distant associates.CommentsBill DeSmedtKnowledge engineer, philosophical dilletante, and author of the cult classic science thriller SingularityThe \"Genius of Dogs\" is all the rage these days. But do dogs have actual genius? As to that, I offer in evidence the lowly (pun intended) dachshund.Comments (19)Amy TraubSenior Policy Analyst at DemosSometimes in America, when low-paid workers stand up and speak out, even the President of the United States takes notice. This is one of those moments.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsIt\u0027s important to understand, or at least attempt to understand, the mental state that produces such plutocratic rage. After all, our political and economic system gives billionaires an extraordinary influence over the lives of every individual in the country. It pays to investigate their emotional makeup, if only for our societal well-being.Comments (18)Peter WattsWriter, presenter, public speakerIt\u0027s the most unenviable job in politics: delivering the response to the president\u0027s State of the Union address. A high-wire act performed over circling sharks, the number one goal is simply to avoid coming out of it as chum. To emerge merely a chump can be considered success.CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsNewsflash: It\u0027s not OK to be selfish, impatient, and out of control. These traits, while common, are unacceptable. They should not be accepted, least of all by the people you claim to love. This philosophy is poison, and it stretches beyond one offensive quote from a 20th century Playboy Bunny.Comments (80)Kevin SmithThat fat guy who got thrown off the planeI\u0027ll miss you, Jim. Thanks for shaping the last two decades of my life. Rest in peace knowing you were an absolute success and, with the exception of that one mall picture, you made some excellent, unforgettable movies.CommentsJeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027In the end, I think -- I hope -- what Klein is doing is staking his ground and following a dictum I started thinking about in 2007: Do what you do best and link to the rest. What he wants to do best is explain the news and the world to the public. That\u0027s a tall order but I like the mission.CommentsDavid FontanaAssociate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.If you want a compelling story about our national political life as the politics of 2014 begin--and what has been and might happen with the Republican Party--look to the North Country.CommentsJennifer DziuraCareer and life coaching advice writer at GetBullish.comMost of us talk about our sex lives with at least one person we\u0027re not having sex with. Yet many of us do not talk about money with anyone at all.CommentsRoadtrippersDiscover Your AmericaReporters are calling this house \"the Cayman Islands on the Great Plains,\" a small home in the suburbs of Cheyenne that holds a pretty wild secret.Comments (11)Andrey TolokonnikovFather of Pussy Riot Band MemberWith \"the money in front of them,\" Pussy Riot has disbanded as a music group in order to focus full-time on political activism in Russia.CommentsMike WeisserMike the Gun GuyMaybe I\u0027ve got it all mixed up, but I haven\u0027t seen any interviews with guys in prison who pulled out a gun and shot someone because it was the \"only\" way they could settle an argument on favorable terms.Comments (374)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThese arrangements enrich some politicians and CEOs while impoverishing everyone else. The resulting rising income inequality is deliberate, not an accidental slip of some clumsy invisible hand of the market.Comments (77)Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
