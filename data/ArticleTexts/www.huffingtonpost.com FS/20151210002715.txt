{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsWhat neither the Republican nor the Democratic Party leadership seems willing to question -- in public at least -- is whether this war is one in which the United States should now be so invested. What neither set of leaders seem willing to admit is that being in that war necessarily invites a warlike response from those we attack; and that in consequence being in this war inevitably makes America less safe than if no war was underway. And no one in either party is currently making the case for handing this war over to the international community as a whole, even though we are repeatedly told that countries as distant from us in interests and ideology as Russia and Iran wish ISIS gone. If they do, why is the U.S. leading the coalition? Why is this whole matter not back in the hands of the UN Security Council?Though I did face life-threatening dangers while in the military, I was never shot at.

Your fault. Your neighbor\u0027s fault. Your co-worker\u0027s fault. American voters have the opportunity to do something about this.

Views expressed are her own.China is not the only country in East Asia to eye the global thermometer and begin to sweat. Of the top ten emitters of carbon dioxide in the world, three are close neighbors: China, Japan, and South Korea.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogAs a Black trans woman, I am used to unfair and discriminatory treatment, but this was extra upsetting because we were paying customers at a hotel and on our way to a funeral.
