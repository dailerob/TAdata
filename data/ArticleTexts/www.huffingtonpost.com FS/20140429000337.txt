{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThis week, the House Ways and Means Committee is poised to demonstrate exactly how the rules get rigged. Beginning on Tuesday, the committee will mark up a series of bills on corporate tax breaks -- known as \"extenders\" because they have been extended regularly every year or two for over a decade. Only now the Committee plans to make many of them permanent, at the cost of an estimated $300 billion over 10 years. And it does not plan to pay for them by closing other corporate loopholes or raising rates. The giveaway -- almost all of which goes to corporations -- will simply add to the deficit. And no doubt those who vote for them will later demand deeper cuts in programs for the vulnerable in order to bring \"spending\" under control.It has everything to do with Obama Derangement Syndrome -- Republican governors who refuse for a variety of cheap political excuses to attach their names to Obamacare. By doing so, they\u0027re hurting their own people, including Republican voters by numbers into the hundreds of thousands per state.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowWe might not be in the back of the bus, and we might not drink from separate water fountains, but racial discrimination is very much alive in 2014. Anyone who ever doubted that reality can look at the events of the past week.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkAn economy with nobody working is boring. The share of the population that is working simply has not recovered.Douglas Holtz-EakinPresident, American Action ForumThere are latent majorities on numerous issues that do not see the light of day because the corporatists\u0027 toadies -- the political leaders in Congress -- make sure there are no hearings, no floor debates or votes.Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing their job just fine. They are issuing mortgage backed securities that include more than 60 percent of new mortgages. Interest rates on mortgages are low and both companies are making substantial profits that are refunded to the government. Why is there any need to overhaul this system?Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027If you don\u0027t feel ready to take the leap quite yet, you shouldn\u0027t judge yourself either. I sure don\u0027t.Akirah RobinsonBreakup Coach and WriterApril 28 marks the tenth anniversary of the moment that the horrors of Abu Ghraib were made public in this country. Thus began America\u0027s public odyssey with torture, a story in many chapters and still missing an ending.Karen J.

The answer seems clear to me: work for the empowerment of women.William PetrocelliAuthor, Attorney, and BooksellerIf two consenting adults want to put an economic value on an empty car or a vacant room, isn\u0027t that a net gain to both? Isn\u0027t this precisely what free markets do -- and why should government get involved at all?Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Mayors around the world are coming up with new ways to tackle difficult challenges because mayors understand the needs of their communities -- and they are responsible for delivering results.Michael R. Bloomberg108th Mayor of the City of New YorkI didn\u0027t feel that I would be believed by my family, not because of anything they said to me, but because of the implicit messages I received from society.Erin McKelleActivist, writer, student at Ohio UniversityIf our society complacently allows power brokers like Donald Sterling to go unpunished for their prejudice, it will be maddeningly difficult for America to progress towards a more just and equitable future.Oluseyi FayanjuFormer fellow at the Environmental Defense FundVirunga National Park is a unique asset that could, if utilized correctly, be an economic development engine. We believe it is important for the Congolese to chart a development path that benefits the majority, not a privileged few, and above all else, enforce its own laws.Richard BransonHoward G. BuffettDesmond TutuAt one point or another, we\u0027ve all felt adrift -- as if we just couldn\u0027t sync to the rhythm of our own heart. When you\u0027re feeling lost, distant, or disconnected, the most important thing you can do is come into harmony with yourself.Panache DesaiContemporary thought leader and spiritual teacherAmerica\u0027s retirement crisis is as consequential as our healthcare crisis. We mustered the will to do the hard work of extending access to healthcare to all Americans. We must also meet a just and civilized standard for retirement, so that retirement is a time of security, not poverty.Randi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersThis is 2014, and as people like LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and even President Barack Obama have said, we cannot tolerate this behavior. And yet, the challenge for recently minted Commissioner Adam Silver is complicated.Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportEver since Beowulf, poetry has been critical to the development of the English language. We are now seeing a form of literary expression disappear without any discussion of whether it has a role to play in modern education.Cynthia WachtellAuthor, \u0027War No More: The Antiwar Impulse in American Literature, 1861-1914\"Meditation, yoga, exercise, breathing techniques, nutrition and mindfulness are all very useful ways for everyone to stay well or manage a host of chronic illnesses, not just those in my field. How can we get these techniques broadly into a diverse population that could benefit?Lloyd I. Sederer, MDMedical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthThere are far more things that most people with disabilities can do than not do, making them pretty darned ordinary, in other words, just like the rest of us. Why should what they are not able to do define how others view them?Dr. Jim TaylorAdjunct faculty, University of San FranciscoThe feminist movement, which gathered strength in the 1960s and 1970s in the West, arrived in East-Central Europe much later. Women\u0027s equality was a stated principle of the Communist governments, and official women\u0027s organizations operated in all of the countries.John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusNow\u0027s the time to de-clutter your love life, so let\u0027s clean out what\u0027s not working and get some fresh perspective.

Any other course of action would basically amount to the NBA tolerating and condoning a hateful bigot.Armstrong WilliamsSole owner of Howard Stirk Holdings TV stations; Executive Editor of American CurrentseeThe Putin worldview carries with it the seeds of potential frictions with the West beyond the Crimea. It promises a hardnosed promotion of Russian national interest.Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe tech sector in New York City is on the rise.

The other half are in startups.Jack HidaryEntrepreneurIf you think explaining tech policy is difficult, try putting it to music and lyrics.
