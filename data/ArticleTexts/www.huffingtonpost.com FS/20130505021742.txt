{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week brought evidence that America continues to evolve in positive ways. On Monday, NBA player Jason Collins came out, becoming the first openly gay male athlete in a major sport. Collins\u0027 trust in the American people was rewarded, as the response to his revelation was overwhelmingly positive. Too bad that same trust isn\u0027t shared by Washington, which continues to operate out of fear. Gun control seems dead, despite decreased support for Senators who voted against universal background checks, and increased support for those who voted for them. Likewise, this week President Obama reiterated his desire to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay -- where a hunger strike has spread to 100 of the 166 prisoners still being held there without a trial -- but he\u0027s done very little to make it happen. Unlike Collins, whom he called to congratulate, the president doesn\u0027t seem to trust us to rise to the occasion.CommentsJamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorYesterday Jason Collins changed the world forever when he told the truth. Yesterday Jason Collins told the NBA, the players and fans that he was a gay man. It is the moment of truth that the world has been waiting for.Comments (325)Ben AffleckAcademy Award-winning producer and writerAs a nation we both claim a noble position in the world and assert a reputation for fostering freedom, human rights and fairness here and abroad. If indeed we are to live up to that, we cannot abide having some among us who starve.Comments (635)Arianna HuffingtonOur culture is obsessed with time. This is our real deficit crisis, and one that, unlike the more commonly discussed deficit, is actually getting worse. In fact, researchers have given this crisis a name: \"time famine.\"Comments (207)Mark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVBillions of dollars are being invested to make trading without humans faster, cheaper, smarter. The problem is that no matter how smart you make machines, they will never be smart enough in our lifetime to detect all levels of deceit and fraud. Particularly online.Comments (36)Margaret ChoComedian, actor and recording artistI got in Twitter fights for outing someone. But if public figures came out of the closet, then the LGBT kids who saw them on TV would feel safe, before they even knew why they felt dangerous. Maybe if enough people came out of the closet, gay kids would never feel dangerous.Comments (240)Chris KluweNFL player, Minnesota VikingsWhy do I speak out in support of the gay community? Because the words, \"We should round them all up and send them to an island to die,\" are absolutely abhorrent to any rational-minded person and should never be uttered by one member of the human race about another.Comments (492)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAnyone despairing that Congress can\u0027t get anything done should note last week\u0027s swift vote to get furloughed air traffic controllers back to work. Congress can move very quickly and efficiently when it wants to and when their own comfort and that of constituents well-off enough to fly was affected.Comments (247)Ted Danson and Andrew SharplessIn the ocean you find a symphony of sound, from the clicking of snapping shrimp to the long mournful wails of whales, and zips of dolphins. Now imagine this oceanic soundscape shattered by dynamite-like blasts, every 10 seconds for days and even weeks on end.Comments (128)Melinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationEmpowered, mobilized communities don\u0027t just address one single issue, such as female genital cutting; they work steadily to recognize and then meet all their needs.CommentsDoug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWashington\u0027s foreign policy should be one of peace. Today the U.S. is without peer. Terrorism is the most serious security threat facing the country, but it is only exacerbated by promiscuous intervention in conflicts not America\u0027s own.Comments (367)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistBefore Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, Julie Andrews in Victor Victoria and Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot -- throughout history and in almost every culture -- disguising one\u0027s gender has been a common plotline in folklore, literature and theater. Cross-dressing gods and goddesses frequently populated Greek, Norse and Hindu mythology; and Shakespeare\u0027s plotlines often featured women characters posing as menComments (168)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPayrolls increased by 165,000 last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 7.5 percent, in a jobs report that painted a considerably brighter picture than last month\u0027s version.Comments (203)Elizabeth DrewJournalistThe nonsense about what it takes for a president to win a victory in Congress has reached ridiculous dimensions. The fact that Barack Obama failed to win legislation to place further curbs on the purchase of guns has made people who ought to know better decide that he\u0027s not an \"arm-twister.\"Comments (564)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe magnitude of NBA player Jason Collins\u0027 coming out today cannot be overestimated. He breaks a barrier that we\u0027ve been waiting for someone to plunge through: a major league sports player saying \"I\u0027m gay\" while still playing and at the height of his career.Comments (288)Lea GroverWriter and toddler-wranglerI know you didn\u0027t expect most of this. I know you didn\u0027t anticipate loving somebody so intensely, or loathing your post-baby body so much, or being so tired, or being the mom you\u0027ve turned out to be.Comments (238)Ban Ki-moonSecretary-General, United NationsMalaria continues to inflict a major toll on least developed countries -- primarily in Africa -- and millions of people still lack access to life-saving interventions. In Africa, malaria kills a child every minute.Comments (19)Rita F. PiersonEducational trainer, motivational speaker, authorIn the spring of my career, I found myself questioning the choice of my life\u0027s work. The students did not appear to be motivated, the paperwork was overwhelming and the constant change of educational direction was discouraging. But, I just could not seem bring myself to do anything else.Comments (261)Bill Moyers and Michael WinshipFrancine and David moved from New York City to Newtown to raise a family somewhere safe. They could never have imagined that in that quiet place on a Friday morning, just days before Christmas, gunfire would take their younger son\u0027s life.Comments (117)Maude StandishCo-Founder and Managing Director of Tarot a Millennial Trend Research CompanyI\u0027m not married yet -- that\u0027s just a few short months down the line -- but I\u0027ve already made up my mind.Comments (614)James FrancoActor and authorMacbeth with Alan Cumming: another dazzling and brilliant one-person show. Yes, Macbeth as a one-man show, a portrayal of Macbeth by a man losing his mind in an institution. Cumming is superb.Comments (17)Denise HenryWriter and editorI wipe my children\u0027s faces a certain way, I caress their knees or elbows in a certain way when they fall down and I scold them in a way that only a parent can.Comments (1,176)Will SelfWill Self is a novelist, journalist and RAPt supporterYou don\u0027t need to have suffered from addictive illness (although it undoubtedly helps) to understand that abstinence-based recovery is the only method that really works - in the sense of bringing the individual completely face-to-face with the underlying psychological problems that cause him or her to use drugs and alcohol in the first place. Nor do you need to be an addict (although, once again, in indisputably helps), to know that the current Kafkaesque condition of our prisons is a direct result of addiction treatments that are really nothing of the sort.Comments (55)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50There\u0027s no shortage of words in the English language that are consistently mispronounced. Here are just three of them.Comments (1,787)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027This week marked six months since Superstorm Sandy left entire communities devastated, families homeless, and many with little hope. But in the midst of this natural disaster, many banded together. One young filmmaker in New York, Farihah Zaman, caught that resilience and acts of service on video.CommentsThe Amazing KreskinWith a showman\u0027s flair, a comedian\u0027s wit, and capacities of a bona fide Mentalist...I\u0027ve given a lot of thought to what I\u0027m going to talk to you about right now given the gravity of the most recent prediction I have been preparing to reveal. These are not logical things I\u0027m going to say, but things that I feel very, very strongly about.Comments (128)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAs new graduates leave college and enter the labor force, they may wish to consider the advice that I was incredibly lucky to receive from my father as a child. Be serious and disciplined in pursuing more than the what, when and why. Also be curious, and think deeply about the how.CommentsGuy Kawasaki and Caleb TillerA simple summary of my life is that my parents worked very hard so that I could have a great education, and I took that education and worked very hard to get where I am. I would like my kids\u0027 lives to be exactly the same.CommentsSusan Spencer-WendelJournalistIt\u0027s odd to think of my autopilot life, the one before. Working at a job I loved and navigating the daily dance of sibling warfare, homework and appointments. Then one night I looked down at my left hand. \"Holy shit,\" I yelped. \"You need to go to the doctor,\" John said.CommentsJonathan RauchAuthor, \u0027Denial: My 25 Years Without a Soul\u0027My childish, playtime fantasy was freighted with a strange power. This was more than playing Batman and punching invisible enemies in the stomach. I wanted in a deeper, more slavishly yearning way to be Sinbad the Sailor.Comments (19)Arianna Huffington, 2013. 5.05Rabbi Edward Bernstein, 2013. 4.05Liz Ryan, 2013. 4.05Doug Bradley, 2013. 4.05Robert L.
