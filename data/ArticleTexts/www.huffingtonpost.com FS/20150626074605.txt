Once again, the ACA has survived a potentially fatal challenge. The significance of today\u0027s decision, however, also extends into the future. Because of how the Supreme Court reasoned in the case, a future president opposed to the ACA (including all of the current crop of GOP contenders) will not be able to reinterpret the law to deny subsidies to low- and middle-income taxpayers in the future.Dr. William C.

Firstly, while there is no hierarchy of death where one is better than the other, it\u0027s safe to say that living a long life is at the top while a short one is at the bottom.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIn one form or another, the U.S. has been at war with Iraq since 1990, including a sort-of invasion in 1991 and a full-scale one in 2003.

None of those efforts were a success.Author of \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"Much of what made up the air I breathed as a little white girl growing up in lower Alabama was revisionist history. The \"South\" that I love and have been desperately homesick for doesn\u0027t really exist.Math teacher. Displaced Southerner. Conversationalist.For many people, the difficulties start before stepping foot in the store.Inspiring cooks. Nourishing homes.In contrast to Clinton, Sanders has supported the issue of gay marriage since 2000, vehemently opposed the Iraq War, opposes TPP, wants student loan debt reforms, fights for veterans, and isn\u0027t afraid to blast \"too big to fail\" Wall Street firms.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsAs a result of today\u0027s decision in King v. Burwell, 19,000 people in my district, 232,000 people in Illinois and 6.4 million Americans in 34 states across the country can go to bed tonight knowing that they will wake up tomorrow insured and able to take care of their family\u0027s medical needs.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtI have been a comedian for about 22 years. As a white male, I have undeniably been given advantages throughout that people of color and women are not afforded.Standup comedianAndrogyny is not something often considered beautiful, so for Ruby Rose to redefine beauty and still have mass appeal is very exciting. But it does raise questions over why some gender non-conformity is celebrated while other forms are ridiculed or ignored.A twenty something chap living in London and writing about all sorts. If you want an opinion on something, you can trust that I\u0027ll have one.President Obama not only expended his own \"political capital\" by pushing for fast-track but that of the Democratic Party too. He had a clear choice: either side with workers, environmentalists, consumers, and progressives -- or side with Wall Street, Big Pharma, Wal-Mart, and the Koch Brothers.Professor, historian, authorLike the curly hair versus straight hair conundrum, women with large breasts wish they had smaller breasts, and women with smaller breasts wish they had larger breasts.

Unlike the West, which transitioned from mainframe computers to PCs to tablets and then to smartphones, India is making a leap directly into mobile. It did the same a few years ago when a billion people started using cellphones. But smartphones are going to have an even more profound impact on India.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurLast week in Charleston we were tragically reminded yet again that domestic extremists pose a serious threat to our society.

It is too late to bring the traitors of 1861 to justice, but surely we can stop treating them as perverse heroes, and we can start calling the Confederacy what it really was.Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioMaybe you were feeling a little too confident this week -- a little too put-together or in control of your life.
