{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressOne thing that\u0027s really terrible about any presidential election process is nearly everything about the presidential election process. There\u0027s a lot of silly drama when states try to move up in the primary calendar, there are far too many debates, and the whole thing is just absurdly long. It shouldn\u0027t be this hard to nominate and elect a president -- why can\u0027t this just take a couple of months? This is America! -- and it\u0027s high time we killed the whole thing with fire. Well, the precious footfalls of baby steps are at least pattering in the distance. CNN\u0027s Peter Hamby reports that \"handpicked members of the Republican National Committee,\" who have met in \"a series of closed-door meetings since August,\" have proposed a \"sweeping plan\" to lessen the obvious awfulness of the GOP primary process, in the hopes that maybe the 2016 election won\u0027t be so excruciating for their nominee.Comments (151)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageI can understand why Republican leaders like this deal. They don\u0027t want to risk another government shutdown, given how badly they got burned by the last one earlier in the fall. But America would do better with another temporary spending resolution than with this raw deal.Comments (173)Colin FalconerAuthor, \u0027The Beginner\u0027s Guide to Fatherhood\u0027Buy a live octopus and a string bag. Attempt to put the octopus into the string bag so that no arms hang out. Time allowed: 5 minutes.Comments (19)Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyWhy are record numbers of Americans on food stamps? Because record numbers of Americans are in poverty. Why are people falling through the cracks? Because there are cracks to fall through.Comments (51)Alissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgIt has been one year since I saw my sweet little Emilie. I will be honest, I hate when the media comes into town. I don\u0027t like seeing their vans with large satellite dishes parked on every corner. I don\u0027t like seeing my daughter\u0027s picture on the news associated with her violent death.Comments (85)Dennis J. KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateIn a country where the average monthly minimum wage stands at about $150 USD, it\u0027s not hard to understand why Ukrainians are in the streets. But is their plight being exploited to usher in a new military agreement under the guise of economic reform?CommentsBen FoldsLeader of Ben Folds FiveSchools are cutting their music programs in an attempt to save money. But wait. A crazy thing is happening. This next generation of students is filling the musical education void by just doing it themselves.CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIf Congress takes matters into its own hands, and violates both the letter and spirit of the agreement, in order to score political points with hard-liners in the United States, they will also be breaking an agreement negotiated with the international community.Comments (25)Oliver TearleAuthor; Lecturer in English, Loughborough Univ.Harper Lee\u0027s friend gave her a year\u0027s wages for Christmas, on the condition that she give up work and write. She then wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. A rather brilliant Christmas present, I think you\u0027ll agree.CommentsPatient 5150Issue advocateThe reasons why I suffered a nervous breakdown are none of your business. What is the business of anyone who cares about mental health is that the most harrowing days of my life were when I recently tried to get help for a mental illness.CommentsJeff MadrickRoosevelt Institute Senior Fellow; author, \u0027Age of Greed\u0027The backlash against Summers was too great to be withstood, so Yellen was nominated instead. But Fischer is surely not the person we need as her number two.CommentsLaura W. MurphyDirector, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeInnocent Americans should never have to worry their government\u0027s awesome surveillance capabilities are intercepting, filtering, collecting, analyzing, and storing the intimate details of their lives. Appallingly, they do.CommentsGeorge ZaidanFreelance writer, host and producerYes, most of the material in your Lulu review is sand and salt, but there are probably a few grains of truth buried in there, too... truths that you\u0027ve recognized. And knowing that other people recognize them too is a powerful thing.CommentsSandra ShpilbergBiotech executive, advocate for women, writer, momThe cost of child care may be a large percentage of your salary now, but your salary today is a fraction of what it can be in the future if you stay in the workforce, and nurture your career, along with your children.CommentsJack HealeyFounder, Human Rights Action CenterLet us not rest with the knowledge that another world is possible. Let\u0027s join together to make a world of justice and dignity so probable as to be inevitable. I thank Madiba and all of his circle for setting an example that we must all still follow.CommentsJincey LumpkinFounder and Chief Sexy Officer, Juicy Pink BoxSome lesbians are really annoyed to have to field these types of questions, but I feel that having an open mind and an open ear helps to make people outside of the gay community understand us better.Comments (168)Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comTo me, the most appropriate headline from the new budget deal should really be: \"Democrats And Republicans Agree To Remove Budget Negotiations From 2014 Campaign, Out Of Fear.\"Comments (17)Jeff SchweitzerScientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyEven if true, and the Pope were actually trying to make significant change, you don\u0027t get an \"E\" for effort in real life. Time\u0027s award is meant to note significant impact, not good intent. But worse, the Pope has not actually shown good intent, only good media skill.Comments (45)Ron CebikPsychotherapist and TeacherToday?s liberals and progressives still believe the American conservative who espouses a free market-I got mine-you get yours philosophy can be changed if only shown the damage such a viewpoint engenders. This Charlie Brown naivete pervades the political establishment on the left.Comments (19)Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyFor a few months after Sandy Hook, it looked like the government was going to pass a new gun control law, specifically aimed at keeping guns out of the \"wrong\" hands. How is it that a majority of Americans now believe gun laws should be weakened or remain the same?Comments (34)Kali HawlkOwner and Writer, Common Sense MillennialIf the average twenty-something has somewhere around $25,000 of debt to their name, then I must be a highly unique member of the millennial generation. I graduated from Kennesaw State University, a fast-growing school in the suburbs of Atlanta, in 2011. It was the same year that the total amount of student loan debt in the U.S. reached a whopping $1 trillion, but when I graduated, I did so as a completely debt-free individual.CommentsBrian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityNothing says SEXY better than a poster of a scantily clad woman in Nazi garb standing outside of what appears to be a Photoshopped concentration camp. That is the world of Tila Tequila on the web today.Comments (72)Josh Silver and Mansur GidfarPoliticians love to pay lip service to transparency and accountability, and If you bring up money in politics, they\u0027ll feed you some variation of the go-to line: \"believe me, no one is more disgusted with this system than I am, but that\u0027s how our system works.\"Comments (49)Samina AliCurator, Muslima: Muslim Women\u0027s Arts \u0026 VoicesEach and every one of these women is included because she is noteworthy -- a cutting-edge artist or writer, a revolutionary who is upending her community\u0027s and the world\u0027s limited notions of what a Muslim woman is capable of doing, a pioneer fighting for women\u0027s and girls\u0027 rights.Comments (14)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911It\u0027s not a time to point fingers at the other guys and blame them for their supposed past sins. If you haven\u0027t yet noticed, millennials are a pretty savvy generation and, as this poll shows, they\u0027re damn tired of being told to blame the other party for the problems that both created.CommentsStephanie SchriockPresident of EMILY\u0027s List and American WomenWomen\u0027s issues are American economic issues. Especially when we are talking about women\u0027s actual economic issues. Which exist in droves.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt is wrong to aver that moderate minimum wage increases do not lead to any losses of jobs or hours by affected workers. But the benefits of the wage increase leave them better off, on net.Comments (14)Joanne MarinerSenior Crisis Response Advisor, Amnesty InternationalHow did a bad situation become worse, and then much, much worse? When did hatred of the Seleka degenerate into - for many of the country\u0027s Christians - anger at all Muslims? In the longer term, Christians and Muslims in the Central African Republic will need to reconcile. For now they just need to stop killing each other.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostLapsed Catholic, atheist and people of other religions have all declared themselves a fan of this Pope. And, as a Baptist minister so have I. Pope Francis is the religious figure that the world has been waiting for.Comments (68)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureFederal workers will be expected to subsidize this deal with an increase in their out-of-pocket pension costs. There will be cuts to Medicare. Airline passengers will pay a new tax. Military retirees -- military retirees -- will see their benefits cut.Comments (134)Eddie ParsonsStyle ConsultantI know sounding critical of this gathering or opportunity to enjoy temperatures in the 80\u0027s is easy pickings but let\u0027s call it out. This thing is a business boom for galleries, hotels, and other services in Miami; so keep the art rolling.CommentsRonnie Citron-Fink, 2013.12.12Ron Nehring, 2013.12.12Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013.12.12Christopher Hennessy, 2013.12.12Tanya M.
