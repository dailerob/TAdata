{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversitySince 2003, we have been a country famous for not merely the occasional war, dedicated to the destruction of an enemy by air power (as in Vietnam) or by a proxy army on the ground (as in Nicaragua). We are also the world\u0027s innovator of preventive wars, \"wars of choice\" against selected target countries such as Iraq or Libya. Our leaders in both parties have consented to a state of things in which the fame of the United States is tested and must be proved by continuous engagement in multiple wars. And if not wars, then widely distributed black-ops killings, in faraway places where the United States is said to have vital interests. Those killings now come under the official description counter-terrorism, which is a way of saying: terrorism by the right people.By a vote of 96-3, the Senate this week approved an $85 billion bundle of breaks known as \"extenders,\" so named because they supposedly expire every two years. In reality, these breaks have become an all-but-permanent part of the tax code, costing the Treasury billions of dollars a year in lost revenue.Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostThese were not the dregs of society looking for a handout. These were working people, just like me, who just needed some help. This was a shocking reminder of what has become of the middle class.Dennis PowersInternet technologistAbramson’s departure is igniting such an intense conversation, precisely because she is one of few women in such positions of power. And the thought of her being forced out of her job even in part because she was too “pushy” is ominous.Emma GraySenior Editor, HuffPost WomenWhen Karl Rove decided that he would question whether the fall and concussion Hillary Clinton suffered in 2012 to try to disqualify her from consideration for the presidency, it was only his latest cynical move. That Rove is up to his old dirty tricks should come as no surprise.Joseph C. WilsonCEO, JC Wilson International VenturesBeing a leader is a complex task, but the defining moments of great leadership can be surprisingly simple. As a father of three kids under six, I\u0027ve noticed some striking parallels between the morals of bedtime stories and the legacies of illustrious leaders.Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027One of my favorite activities is sitting with a book and underlining the points I find most interesting. That\u0027s why I love the Amazon Kindle\u0027s \"popular highlights\" feature, which lets readers highlight meaningful, resonant passages and share them with other readers. Recently I checked in to see what passages readers have been highlighting in Thrive. Here are the top ten current highlights, in order of popularity.Arianna HuffingtonWhile the cool kids were out smoking cigarettes and tongue kissing, I was in front of the TV, with a sleeve of Oreos, absorbed in trite plots of short-lived sitcoms.Annelia AlexAcademic archaeologist and social bloggerAfter 23 years of evolving into a proud adult woman, a few pieces of fabric and (lack of) wire had reduced me to a pre-teen girl.Alanna VagianosAssociate Editor, HuffPost WomenI am a 29-year-old woman who, just a year and a half ago, pooped my pants while running a marathon.Lindsay Patton-CarsonWriter, editor for Revue magazine, runner and pop culture nerd.After grabbing the data for over 2,500 films, here\u0027s an overview of the critic and audience scores with some notable outliers labelled.Ben MooreData blogger and Computational Biology PhD studentThe vote was taken at the Federal Communications Commission Thursday morning, as drums pounded and hundreds of demonstrators supporting Net neutrality chanted outside FCC headquarters.Michael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.DEA Administrator Leonhart is virtually the only person left who still zealously supports the failed war on drugs. The U.S. and the rest of the world are moving toward an approach that prioritizes public health and legal regulation -- but she remains hopelessly committed to the failed war-on-drugs approach.Bill PiperDrug Policy Alliance, Director of National AffairsCan an organization whose rank-and-file membership is overwhelmingly white, male, rural, blue-collar and committed to \"family values,\" reorient itself to capture the hearts and minds of a population that is increasingly non-white, college educated, urban-suburban and pro-gay rights?Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyShould someone who has done such immense damage to the rule of law and our moral sensibilities be awarded with a judgeship on the First Circuit Court?Medea BenjaminCo-founder, CODEPINK: Women for Peace\"Teaching to the test\" is a monumental miscalculation reminiscent of the bleeding practiced by doctors in previous centuries. Coercing thousands of students to focus all of their attention on achieving good scores on a few \"core\" subjects does not make them smarter, even if they do score better on tests.Lt. Gen. Clarence E. McKnight Jr.Author and former head of the Signal CorpsMinimum-wage workers devastated by the economic crash of 2008 have continued to languish in poverty while the subsequent recovery has sent executive compensation soaring. Nowhere is the disparity starker than in the fast-food industry, which a recent report called the most unequal sector in the U.S. economy.Eric T. SchneidermanAttorney General for New York StateEgypt\u0027s election, together with the others, only underscores the shattered hopes for democratic empowerment that facile Western commentators had once cheered as an \"Arab spring.\"Jeffrey LaurentiInternational affairs analyst and commentatorWith the death toll still mounting at a coal mine in Turkey, another southern Illinois coal miner lost his life this week, along with two West Virginia miners. The state of Illinois, meanwhile -- called out at public hearings for a brewing coal ash catastrophe -- handed out a controversial permit for a Peabody Energy strip mine in southern Illinois.Jeff BiggersAuthor of \u0027Reckoning at Eagle Creek: The Secret Legacy of Coal in the Heartland\"Our nation has changed dramatically, and for the better. But the present bears many parallels to that historical moment 50 years ago, as newer, subtler efforts at voter suppression have run rampant.Dale HoDirector of the ACLU\u0027s Voting Rights ProjectIt doesn\u0027t take an MBA to realize paying Rush Limbaugh $50 million a year to anchor cellar-dweller stations in major markets and to host a program that attracts elderly men but fewer national advertisers isn\u0027t a blueprint for future success.Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaWhatever Operation New Normal may be pales in comparison to the real \"new normal\" for U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM). The lower-cased variant is bold and muscular. It\u0027s an expeditionary force on a war footing. To the men involved, it\u0027s a story of growth and expansion, new battlefields, \"combat,\" and \"war.\"Nick TurseManaging Editor, TomDispatch.comThis visualization stems from my irrational, lifelong infatuation with Waffle House, the always-open dive joint that manages to provide a low-cost, consistently-satisfying breakfast meal at its 1,600 locations.Nik FreemanGeographerDo women and men experience burnout differently? If we can pinpoint the ways men and women experience burnout, then folks like me who work to help busy professionals better prevent burnout can tailor better, earlier and more specific interventions.Paula Davis-LaackLawyer turned stress \u0026 resilience expertIf you accept one basic premise -- that wealth is finite -- then all the financial, economic and social upheaval in our country starts to make sense. There isn\u0027t enough to go around when one sector gets a lock-tight grip on the purse and the purse strings.Paul Steven StoneNovelist, essayistAs commencement seasons go, 2014 has hosted an unusually high number of protests against accomplished individuals and government leaders invited to speak. Who\u0027s really at fault here?Tyler KingkadeAssociate Editor, The Huffington PostThese protests are not about the individual speakers themselves. And they\u0027re most certainly not just about commencement speeches. This is our generation of young people sending a clear and strong message that racism, bigotry, civil and human rights violations receive no honor from us.Amani Al-KhatahtbehFounding Editor-in-Chief, MuslimGirl.net; political analyst; public speakerSan Francisco is in the middle of a class war. It\u0027s not the first or last city to have heart-wrenching inequality tear at its fabric, challenge its values, test its support structures. But what\u0027s jaw-dropping to me is how openly, defensively, and critically technology folks demean those who are struggling.danah boydSenior researcher, Microsoft Research; Research Assistant Professor, New York UniversityThey\u0027re super worldly and make home-cooked meals sexy and delicious.Spoon UniversitySpoonUniversity.comFolks, this has become a big issue on Twitter -- how do you get to the real good stuff on your Twitter feed? Where are the tweets from your community? And how do you make an effort to use Twitter most effectively for you and your organization?Craig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgDue to a sudden, unnecessary and -- most of all -- discriminatory change in bank policy, Iranians and Iranian Americans across the country suddenly try to use their debit cards to make a purchase or withdraw money from an ATM, only to find that their accounts have been frozen effective immediately.Ryan CostelloJamal AbdiGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"PUSH THIS!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
