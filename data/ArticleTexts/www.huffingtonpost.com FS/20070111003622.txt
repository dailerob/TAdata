Lack of courage by our representatives silences us, deprives us of the voice guaranteed by the Constitution, and endangers our troops.READ POST | comments01.08.2007 Arianna HuffingtonAs the president prepares to lay out his new plan for Iraq it might be useful to have a diagnostic checklist -- key symptoms we should look for to help us evaluate where he currently rates on the delusional scale.READ POST | comments (151)01.09.2007 Lt.
