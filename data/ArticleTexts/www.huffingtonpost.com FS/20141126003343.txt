{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupIf you know St. Louis, or Missouri for that matter, you know that the family of Michael Brown had no chance, and that police Officer Darren Wilson would go free. St. Louis is a lovely place, but legally it can be a toxic police mixture of the Midwestern love of social order and Border State race-based severity. Not surprisingly, the Missouri state legislature has chosen repeatedly to ignore a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of 1985, which held that a police officer cannot use lethal force against a fleeing suspect unless the officer has reason to believe the suspect is armed and an immediate threat to public order. Instead, a police officer in Missouri can shoot a person the officer believes to be a fleeing felon. Period. Not to mention that the officer can shoot one who is moving toward him in a threatening manner.This is a sad day. The grand jury\u0027s decision is yet another sign that all of America\u0027s sons\u0027 lives are not yet valued equally in the eyes of our courts. All of America\u0027s fathers, mothers and children should stay outraged and in motion for progress until we are finally what we say we are: One Nation, Under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All.Political Analyst and Civil Rights ActivistWe now all have the chance to examine the evidence -- released last night -- in the grand jury\u0027s decision not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson, who fired multiple bullets into Michael Brown. But the verdict on America\u0027s criminal justice system is already in for many Americans: guilty, for treating young black men differently than young white men.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWe are in a state of emergency, a time of challenge and controversy, but not because of the protestors. That state of emergency will continue until we stand, become uncomfortable, and demand a justice system that addresses the manifestation of pain in protest, the further chipping away of respect, and the real state of emergency our country faces.Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationThe abrupt change of command at the Pentagon, with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel resigning under pressure Monday, is more than a change of faces. It marks the final disillusionment with the two war-fighting strategies the United States has relied on for 13 years in Iraq and Afghanistan.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostWhy did Chuck Hagel step down as secretary of defense? Was it his choice, as Obama has suggested, or was he pushed? We may never be absolutely sure. But one thing that is clear is that Hagel\u0027s tenure was a missed opportunity to put our security policy on a sounder footing at a time of increasing uncertainty.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyI can\u0027t speak. My country has scarred me once again. How can I go to work in the morning on a train full of people who care not? At a workplace of people who missed the story because of football or reality television?University Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaThis is consistent with the cultural logic that makes it okay in America to use brutal force when confronted by a Black villain. Thus, how can a grand jury indict Officer Darren Wilson when he was battling The Hulk?Author, \u0027Black Queer Identity Matrix\u0027 and \u0027Black Comics: Politics of Race and Representation\u0027; professor of communication studies, Rider UniversityOur global climate is warming due to the unprecedented amounts of carbon dioxide we are emitting through the combustion of fossil fuels.Philanthropist, Entrepreneur, Seahawks and Trailblazer Owner, Co-founder Microsoft, Chairman, Vulcan Inc.Perhaps the call to examine this one case would be understandable if justice came more often, but we\u0027ve seen these unjust acts in communities of more color for far too long.New York City Council Member, representing the 45th Council DistrictThere is the ultimate hope that turkey actually has that sleeping ingredient in it and it will magically make our kids Close. Their. Freaking. Eyes.Writer, Physical Therapist and MotherDecades of segregation and inequality in Ferguson, as well as most American metropolitan areas, have fostered a racial inequality exacerbated by the criminalization of not just poverty, but the criminalization of black and brown bodies. Too many whites are too willing to believe that a black body poses a threat.Director, Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society and Professor of Law, African American and Ethnic Studies at UC BerkeleySecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was supposed to steer the Pentagon away from a decade of war, including bringing U.S. troops home from Afghanistan and paving the way for a reduction in the Pentagon budget.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceAt least four million Americans will rejoin the ranks of the uninsured -- and consequently lose access to affordable health care -- if the Supreme Court sides with opponents of Obamacare in a case that hinges on the interpretation of a single sentence in the law.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgI give it my all, pedaling as hard as I can. My legs burn. I am Karlie Kloss. I am a supermodel. I am a Victoria\u0027s Secret Angel and I HAVE WINGS DAMMIT.Editor, HuffPost TeenLet\u0027s play a game, the kind that makes no sense on this single-superpower planet of ours. For a moment, do your best to suspend disbelief and imagine that there\u0027s another superpower, great power, or even regional power somewhere that, between 2001 and 2003, launched two major wars in the Greater Middle East.Editor, TomDispatch.comCooking is one of my favorite pastimes, but cooking a big meal without a plan can take time away from family and friends and add stress to the season. Most of us would rather watch the Bears play the Lions from the couch, not from the kitchen. With that in mind, here are a few tips for removing stress from Thanksgiving and adding more time to focus on family.Former WNBA MVP, four-time Olympic Gold MedalistThe gradual ground we have gained regarding our civil rights should not be confused with the literal stalemate we have had with the U.S. justice system regarding our human rights for more than 200 years.Assistant Professor of African and African Diaspora Studies and Anthropology at the University of Texas at AustinWe don\u0027t want to talk about the sadness that often comes with motherhood in general, never mind things like miscarriage, infertility or death. We ask women to give birth to stillborn babies and then expect them not to talk about it. We certainly don\u0027t want to say the word abortion.Writer. Mom. Human.Where our patients sometimes live in darkness, squalor, danger and hunger, whether run-down trailer, homeless tent or government project, the emergency departments are different. They are places of bright lights and warmth, safety and relief; where beds are clean and food is available. And if nothing else, places where there are people who are interested and polite.Emergency medicine physician, writer, happy husband and father of four.

It was something that I had to live with for the rest of my life. Something that could be fixed -- maybe -- but would take years of effort. Everyone stutters at some point or another but for me it happened more often than I\u0027d like and at times there was nothing I could do to fix it.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityI love the idea of Thanksgiving -- a day to remind us to give thanks, and I wish it were celebrated right across the world.
