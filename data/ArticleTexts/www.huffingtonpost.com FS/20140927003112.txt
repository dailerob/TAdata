{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027Everyone it seems, is seeking to use ISIS for its own ends. The U.S. administration thus is between a rock and a hard place: Saudi Arabia desperately wants Assad\u0027s head on a plate and volunteers to fund the \"war\" effort for that end. But, for Obama to assent to Iranian-Russian conditions -- and thereby indirectly strengthen President Assad -- he will cause outrage in the Gulf and amongst the \"moderate\" Syrian exile insurgents. By doing as the Gulf wishes (attacking Assad\u0027s forces), however, he will almost certainly tip Russia, Iran and Hezbollah into overt opposition and escalation, which will greatly complicate the war on ISIS in Syria (and in Iraq, too).Leaders from many faiths, religions, and wisdom traditions made it clear that climate change presents a spiritual crisis, not just an economic and political debate. Our conversations included dialogue with UN leaders on how to reverse the dangerous direction the world is still taking.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThere are two Champs-Élysées in the world. One is in Paris. It\u0027s filled with movie theaters, boutiques, markets, and fantastic restaurants. Two months ago, I found myself walking down the other Champs-Élysées, nicknamed by aid workers, in the middle of the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.Film ProducerWomen must be heard. Their voices and ideas can greatly contribute to finding climate solutions that work locally and culturally.Fashion model, actress, goodwill ambassador for the UN Environment ProgrammeIt is critically important that public schools entrusted with educating and preparing children for college, work and life stop feeding them into the juvenile and criminal justice systems with zero tolerance policies. Denying a child an education is hardly in the child or society\u0027s best interest.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundI firmly believe that if we started owning up to taking nude photos of ourselves, there would be a lot less stigma surrounding having and sharing them... and if we stopped thinking of nudity and sex as our enemies, we\u0027d have a healthier, happier society.Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe international community is correctly determined to reverse the rise of ISIL by force. But ultimately armed conflict, counterterrorism and law-enforcement are insufficient to reverse the tide of violent extremism.President, American Task Force on PalestineThe controversy over the Girl Scouts using cookie sales to raise funds may be nothing new, but a new arrangement with Nestlé steps way over the line in its willingness to compromise our children\u0027s health for the sake of corporate profits.Author, Producer, AdvocateThe take-away, if there is one, is that while the iOS 8 upgrade represents a giant leap forward with regard to what you can do with your smartphone, it also expands your \"attackable surface.\"Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Founding Partner of Bea is for Business; 2013 MBA out of Wake Forest University.

An unnamed white law enforcement officer had killed an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown on August 9.Virginia Theological Seminary studentI believed that every woman was supposed to be salivating to walk down the aisle and marry the man of her dreams. I kept waiting for that feeling to kick in for me. It\u0027s been 36 years and I\u0027m still waiting.I\u0027ve been paying close attention to the events in Colorado in which students and faculty members of Jefferson County high schools have been protesting the formation of a curriculum review committee that would require students to learn a sanitized version of history that encourages blind patriotism and discourages any sort of protest.Assistant Professor of Social Studies, University of Arkansas; Blogger, EduSanityMy son was pursuing a degree a little like mine -- journalism with an emphasis in environmental issues. He wanted to educate people about climate change, to make people think and feel, to change the world, no less. He was, in fact, the man I had raised him to be. Still, I was sad.Memorist, essayist, teacher, mountain biker, fan of craft beer, goat cheese, and Ben and Jerry\u0027s Coffee Toffee CrunchEveryone recognizes that ISIS cannot be defeated by bombing and missile strikes alone. It just doesn\u0027t work that way.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictI am a proud feminist. I\u0027m pro-choice. I advocate for comprehensive sexuality education and reproductive justice. I teach courses on theology, gender, and sexuality. I want to steal Beyonce\u0027s set from the VMAs and keep it in my living room. And I do all those things not in spite of my faith, but because of it.Writer, educator, and consultant interested in faith and politicsBreaking Bad may have gotten a lot of the story right, from the family nature of the drug to the penetration of the industry by Mexican cartels. Our research reveals new information about the personal nature of meth markets, the unintended consequences of legislation put in place to curb its manufacture and use, and the drug\u0027s terrible impact on children.NORC social scientist that develops and implements data-centric projects on criminal justice and drug policy.Professor and Director, Center for Public Policy at the Wilder School for Government and Public Affairs, Virginia Commonwealth UniversityPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideWhen it comes to criminal justice reform, Attorney General Eric Holder -- who announced today he will soon resign -- waged a revolution from within. Taken individually some of his work seems incremental. Seen as a whole it\u0027s quite bold.Drug Policy Alliance, Director of National AffairsEven the most avid tailgaters are guilty of making this simple \"newbie\" mistake: they always forget something.TheDailyMeal.comBy suspending Mr. Simmons, ESPN has demonstrated that, like the NFL, it too places a higher priority on profits than on sending a proper message about domestic violence and in essence condones the shielding of domestic violence perpetrators.New York City Public AdvocateWhy do politicians like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal still think it\u0027s OK to speak to groups that vilify the LGBT community with outrageous propaganda and demonizing falsehoods? If racism is anathema to the GOP, why isn\u0027t overt anti-LGBT bigotry equally repellent?President, Southern Poverty Law CenterOktoberfest is one of Germany\u0027s greatest cultural exports. Yet every time I mentioned it to German friends in Berlin, I was met with eye rolls and groans.Arthur F. Burns Fellow in BerlinAs we all know modern life can be very stressful. With so many demands on our time, through juggling family, work and friends, it can be a little difficult to give ourselves the attention that we really need and deserve.Kindness changes everything...I can\u0027t count the number of times I have been told that Archie \"hardly even looks like he has Down syndrome.\"Mother, bloggerA good deal of the growing lack of confidence in the Supreme Court these days is due precisely to the concern that the justices are increasingly voting in ways that reflect the political values and preferences of the presidents who appointed them.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoI was more than a little intimidated walking into the studio, but I found the movements were easier to catch onto than I\u0027d expected. After some initial embarrassment, I realized everyone else in the class was having a great time, so I tried my best to just smile along.Senior Editor, Health \u0026 Fitness; Certified Personal TrainerThe president\u0027s speech Wednesday was a step back from a human rights based approach towards the Middle East. His words will not contribute to the long-term peace, stability, and progress of which he spoke, nor will it advance America\u0027s interests in the region or around the world.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstIn Ferguson, Former Chief Brooks sees an opportunity for an effective community-policing program to emerge from the chaos and violence of the past few weeks. \"Now, there is a chance for police and the community to hear each other,\" she said.Political Analyst and Civil Rights ActivistOn the evening of June 23, a middle-aged woman walked into the emergency room of Phebe Hospital with a fever.
