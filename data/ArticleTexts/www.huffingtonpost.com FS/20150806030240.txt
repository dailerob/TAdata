{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgThe pipeline offers President Obama his best chance yet to close the gap between his climate rhetoric and climate reality. If approved, the pipeline could result in a dramatic expansion of tar sands production, an outcome that former NASA scientist Dr. James Hansen famously labeled \"game over\" for the climate. Keystone remains the clearest test of whether or not the President is willing to do what is truly necessary to address the climate crisis: Keep fossil fuels in the ground. It\u0027s the simplest way to see whether Obama has the courage it takes to stand up to Big Oil and say \"no.\" A pipeline rejection would help cement the President\u0027s climate legacy. An approval would completely unravel it.We are facing a two-pronged attack on our democracy -- unlimited money poured into the political process, paired with the systematic suppression of the vote. These are two sides of the same coin.Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontAs a 13-year-old schoolgirl, I witnessed my city of Hiroshima blinded by the flash, flattened by the hurricane-like blast, burned in the heat of 4000 degrees Celsius and contaminated by the radiation of one atomic bomb. Miraculously, I was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building, about 1.8 kilometers from Ground Zero.Hiroshima survivor, peace activistVoters are unhappy, and they are not being served by a government that is paralyzed by money, money that binds politicians to the views of a handful of Americans, stokes the flames of partisanship and keeps Congress and the president from doing anything truly transformational.Former Congressman and Secretary of AgricultureOur climate models that predict how fast the glaciers are melting and the sea is rising don\u0027t take into account a lot of complex processes. Everything is happening faster than we thought it would.Professor in Glaciology, Geological Survey of Denmark and GreenlandThe most pressing threat to constitutionally limited government today is not \"judicial activism\" but reflexive judicial deference to the political branches.Assistant Director at the Institute for JusticeWe tune into presidential debates for the surprises (who knew Rick Perry couldn\u0027t count to three?), but most of what happens is all too predictable. At a GOP debate, you can be sure taxes will be a hot topic. After all, what ailment can\u0027t be cured with a tax cut?Executive Director, Americans for Tax Fairness Action FundThen, this past week, for the first time in decades, Zimbabwe was all over the news. Walter Palmer\u0027s killing of Cecil was a heartless act. But I found the massive outpouring of anger in the United States and Europe bewildering, and frankly, a saddening classic case of misplaced priorities.Handyman living in South AfricaThere are a great many other voters willing to imagine a future without Wall Street greed and rampant income inequality. \"Bernie Sanders Can Become President\" has replaced \"I like him but he can\u0027t win.\" With only a limited amount of media coverage, Sanders has captivated the hopes of millions of Americans.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsRubio\u0027s stumping in Iowa and across the nation almost entirely in Spanish is, quite frankly, a slap in the face to the intelligence of Latino Americans. The GOP\u0027s hope is that he will beguile voters with the \"we\u0027re so alike\" rhetoric and shared stories of heritage that they will not notice that his platform is set against their best interests.Director of Campaigns, Brave New FIlmsDeputy Director at Battle Born ProgressIt seems to me there are four basic strategies the other nine Republicans on the stage have to choose from: ignore Trump, outdo Trump, attack Trump or agree with Trump.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comSeven decades after the city was nearly obliterated, Hiroshima has become a popular tourist destination. For the last four consecutive years, the city has registered record-breaking numbers of foreign tourists.Rhodes scholarImagine if you had found the one person with exactly the skill set you needed and invested the time and money to go through the process only to find out that the random lottery didn\u0027t pick your number.CEO of VISANOW, tech company disrupting legal immigration industryAfter meeting Sam, I understood one more side to this tragedy: Many Americans are still haunted by guilt for their involvement in the bomb\u0027s development.Board certified music therapist, Writer of Discover Japan blogThe correct stance on criminal justice is no longer as simple as \"I\u0027m tough on crime.\" Politicians are waking up to the reality that our overly harsh crime policies need to be rolled back.Director, Justice Program, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU LawI knew the time would come when I would have to make this decision. That time is now. I have three kids and I am 40 years old. I do not think I am too old, I just told myself this was a good age to stop. Now that I am here, I am not sure I am done.TV Personality, Motivational Speaker, Mom of 3 boys, Life coach and founder of Jump Start For Change, LLCAs national outrage over state violence grows, the release of the film should prompt fresh reconsideration of how institutionalized sexual and intimate partner violence against black women continues to be all but invisible in mainstream discourse about black self-determination.Author of Moral Combat: Black Atheists, Gender Politics and the Values Wars and a visiting scholar at USC’s Center for Feminist ResearchOne thing that originally sparked efforts for the dome\u0027s historical preservation was the diary of Hiroko Kajiyama, a high school student who died of leukemia as a result of radiation exposure. A former classmate who seeks to keep the memory of Hiroko alive has been collecting information in order to document her life.Student reporter, Asahi Elementary NewspaperWith only four large airlines controlling more than 80 percent of domestic air travel, the industry is a classic oligopoly. Even the government, which is currently investigating airlines for collusion, seems to agree.Author, How to Be the World\u0027s Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle)Severe storms and hurricanes pose threats to schools in our heartland and on our coasts. If we fail to come together to address climate change, the growing severity of extreme weather events will put families across the nation increasingly at risk.Secretary of Health \u0026 Human Services (HHS)The biggest question on everyone\u0027s mind throughout the night will undoubtedly be how the ever controversial Donald Trump\u0027s presence will affect the debate. All eyes will be on the billionaire, real estate mogul as his actual knowledge of public policy on both domestic and foreign affairs is put to the test.Student at Towson UniversityBut while election modernization has helped break down barriers, it won\u0027t fix the gap in protections for minority voters. We can\u0027t have a truly modern voting system if our voting rights laws lack the power to stop states from enacting 21st Century equivalents of poll taxes the VRA was intended to prevent.President, America Votes and America Votes Action FundThe killing of Cecil the Lion, tragic as it might be to some, has laid bare some key issues that warrant further discussion. Few -- if any -- of these people rallying for ol\u0027 Cecil have shown their public concern and care for Zimbabweans.Editor and contributor, Conversation ZimbabweOur immigration system has put all of the cards in the hands of employers and allowed them to wield entirely too much power over millions of captive and exploitable workers in our labor force.President, AFL-CIOThere\u0027s a glass-half-full perspective that should be considered by even the grumpiest of festivalgoers -- one that\u0027s probably a big part of why events like Lollapalooza sell out completely before their lineups are even announced.Chicago Editor, The Huffington PostIs the practice of civil disobedience justified, in regard to climate change? Unlike war and racism, the effects of global warming are neither clear nor immediate -- though in fact the danger is quickly becoming clearer, as California dries up and wild fires run through the West.Unitarian Univeralist minister, writerWhen you make room in your relationship to honor the possibility of outside attractions and the feelings they create, it can help you stay connected and engaged with each other instead of developing separate lives where you keep your attractions hidden. Being able to talk about scary topics like outside attractions can even help prevent affairs from happening.Sex and Relationship TherapyA Washington Post report reveals that Kasich slashed public school funding by half a billion dollars, boosting state spending on charter schools, despite the quality concerns. In fact, the Ohio now spends more per charter school pupil than it does for public school student, while costs have been passed on to local government just to keep their schools open.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaThe Martian has emerged at a significant juncture in our nation\u0027s space program. After over 50 years of talking about sending humans to Mars, momentum is finally building for humanity to actually achieve that goal.CEO, Explore MarsDirector of Political Outreach for Explore Mars.The public is right: The world is not prepared for the next epidemic. We\u0027re no better equipped to respond quickly to an outbreak than we were a year ago. But we can be - and at a fraction of what it would cost if we don\u0027t act urgently.President, World Bank GroupThe state of our criminal justice system is simply so bad, the political climate for change so good, that it would be an epic desertion of our civic duties -- and of the pressure we as voters possess -- to let the 2016 election slip by without electoral promises of far-reaching reform. Which is why criminal justice must be a key issue for 2016 voters.Columnist, 3L at Harvard LawGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
