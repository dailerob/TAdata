{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027The just-announced nuclear agreement is, in many ways, but a sideshow to the larger issue of regional politics in the Middle East. Despite being heralded as a new start, this agreement, with some exceptions, simply returns Iran to the status it enjoyed in 2005, prior to the dissolution of an earlier agreement intended to bring Iran\u0027s nuclear program under international monitoring, completing what amounts to a decade-long diplomatic journey to nowhere. Reality has sunk in, and with it the need to engage with Iran so that the U.S. can responsibly extricate itself from more than a decade of conflict in that region. By resolving the issue of Iran\u0027s nuclear program, both real and imagined, the Obama administration is able to cut a political Gordion Knot it inherited from the Bush administration, freeing this administration to engage in meaningful diplomacy with, and about, Iran.Hillary Clinton won\u0027t propose reinstating a bank break-up law known as the Glass-Steagall Act -- at least according to Alan Blinder, an economist who has been advising Clinton\u0027s campaign. \"You\u0027re not going to see Glass-Steagall,\" Blinder said after her economic speech Monday in which she failed to mention it. Blinder said he had spoken to Clinton directly about Glass-Steagall. This is a big mistake.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Our agencies have been defending against tens of thousands of persistent attacks for more than a decade. We have seen intrusions at many federal agencies. Yet it took us this long to initiate a 30-Day Cybersecurity Sprint to do what everyone in the data and privacy business has been screaming for since 2005.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Fifteen years ago, when I first started working on drug policy and criminal justice reform issues, I never would have imagined these words coming out of the mouth of a sitting U.S. president. But then again, I would never have imagined Barack Obama.Managing Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceI cannot in good conscience mourn my brother as a victim of genocide unless I similarly mourn all other victims of genocide, including the victims at Srebrenica.Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsAndy Cohen is messy. We know this. That said, he got too messy labeling 16-year-old actress Amandla Stenberg \"Jackhole of the Day\" on Sunday night\u0027s episode of Watch What Happens Live. What\u0027s worse, Laverne Cox and Andre Leon Talley, two Black folk, sat there and let that slide.Author, \u0027Don\u0027t Waste Your Pretty\u0027The Vienna agreement now offers Iran a unique opportunity to move towards the international community following decades of isolation and confrontation. It gives cause for hope that, beyond Vienna, Tehran\u0027s policy will no longer see only opponents but rather potential partners and win-win arrangements in the Middle East.German Foreign MinisterThe nuclear deal with Iran is to be welcomed -- mainly because Obama allowed himself to be trapped in a position where the only alternative was confrontation with the prospect for war. The strategic implications, if not accompanied by wider policy adjustments here and in the region, are marginal at best.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThere are more solar workers than actors in California, according to Bureau of Labor numbers crunched by the Solar Foundation, which also counted more solar jobs in Texas than there are ranchers.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistWeiwei wants to support those people of China, those unheard voices. Whilst he is no longer imprisoned his passport remains confiscated and he\u0027s not allowed to leave the country.Director of Development, Royal Academy of ArtsVoting against the Iran deal is not just wrong, it is stupid politically. And that, more than anything else, is the reason the agreement will pass. Enjoy the sideshow but that is all it is. The Iran agreement is a done deal.Contributor, The Nation\"Did you have them naturally?\" she asked me when she heard that both of my babies were born at over nine pounds. I didn\u0027t have them without medication. But my body formed my children, grew my children, and birthed my children; and yet, I\u0027m never sure how to answer this question. Regardless, I became a mother.A mother, wife, and teacherWall Street and the Koch brothers have an agenda for America that, unless you are a top executive of a powerful corporate conglomerate, won\u0027t work out very well for you. The Democratic Party must embrace a progressive populist economic agenda if it wants to offer a winning alternative in 2016.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe current young generation of Israelis and Palestinians need to see each other through a different lens and adjust psychologically to accept that coexistence is irrevocable, and they must choose to either live in constant violent hostility, or in peace.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWe have heard complaints that removing the Confederate flag and other symbols of hatred is a distraction from the larger problems facing our nation. I agree that significantly more work must be done to address racism and persistent inequality in our nation. But symbols matter. They can connect us, they can tear us apart.Democratic congressman representing New Jersey’s 10th congressional districtThe people you are vilifying are the people you should be admiring.

It had to be saved from that growing segment of European opinion that was sick of seeing a member country place its own legitimacy over that of 18 other members. It had to be saved from itself and from the sentiment that Greece was being prescribed remedies that were akin to a cup of hemlock. But most of all, it had to be saved -- imperatively -- for three reasons.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.It might sound crazy, but I think there is definitely room for realistic and humorous cards for parents who\u0027ve lost children.

Talking to my fiancé that night, something finally clicked.Plus Size Model, Writer, Artist, and WifeAmerica is a melting pot of cultures -- but it seems like not all cultures and ethnicities are welcome.
