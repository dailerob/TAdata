{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"When we announced our merger with AOL, I said that one of the things that most excited me about the deal was how it would allow us to reach our goals -- including the launch of international editions of HuffPost -- much, much faster. Three months later, I\u0027m delighted to be in Toronto for today\u0027s launch of our first international version: Welcome to HuffPost Canada. Canadians are no strangers to The Huffington Post: 1.5 million of them visited us in March. So starting our international expansion north of the border was a natural. HuffPost Canada will provide readers with a turbo-charged, Canada-centric version of the site you already know, featuring our signature blend of news, opinion, entertainment, community, and information -- all delivered with our familiar look and attitude, and tailored to Canadian issues and perspectives. So check out HuffPost Canada and let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 05.26.2011Editor, Eat the PressObviously, Harold Camping is a bad man who convinced hundreds of people to give him all their money and upend their livelihoods on a fraudulent apocalyptic notion, but none of that matters! Not when there are \"electoral implications\" to consider!Read Post | CommentsLaurie David, 05.26.2011Producer/Author/NRDC TrusteeForce-feeding prescription drugs to healthy people, just to make them grow faster, would be considered ludicrous by any doctor. Possibly even criminal. But the FDA allows factory farms to essentially to just that.Read Post | CommentsLloyd I. Sederer, MD, 05.26.2011Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthSales of another form of \u0027bath salts\u0027 are reaching new records -- and bringing grave health hazards. While news of their popularity (and risk) has circulated for some time, there is very disturbing information just out.Read Post | CommentsJim Wallis, 05.26.2011Christian leader for social changeWhile the primary blame for abuse and misdeed against women lies with the perpetrators themselves, we should look next at the good men who say nothing. It\u0027s time for good men to hold accountable those who abuse women.Read Post | CommentsDavid Callahan, 05.26.2011Senior Fellow, DemosI\u0027m all for cracking down on political corruption and the insidious ways in which money subverts our democracy. But even within this category of wrongdoing I can think of plenty of bigger fish to fry than John Edwards.Read Post | CommentsLisa P. Jackson, 05.26.2011EPA AdministratorAs the head of the EPA, I have been called to testify before Congress more than any other cabinet member. The simple fact is, I would not be making so many trips to the Hill if the EPA was not doing its job.Read Post | CommentsRobert Koehler, 05.26.2011Syndicated writerThe big, scary thing about the National Defense Authorization Act -- the thing that summons irrationality from the pit of our collective paranoia -- is the provision that would expand the \"war on terror,\" at presidential discretion, to the whole world.Read Post | CommentsLarry Cox, 05.26.2011Executive Director, Amnesty InternationalToday millions across the Middle East and North Africa are using their voices to demand their rights and freedoms. In some ways the unfolding drama of the Arab Spring mirrors Amnesty International\u0027s story.Read Post | CommentsSabria Jawhar, 05.26.2011Columnist, Saudi GazetteThere was a time when I believed the debate about women banned from driving cars was trivial. It distracted from the real problems of the denial of women\u0027s rights. The imprisonment of Manal Al-Sherif has changed all that.Read Post | CommentsLarry Womack, 05.26.2011Former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostNow that there are no consequences to not paying your bills, there has never been a better time to be a deadbeat in America.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 05.26.2011Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Now it\u0027s official. The 2012 campaign will be about the future of Medicare. This spells trouble for the GOP. Polls show an overwhelming bipartisan majority of Americans want to preserve Medicare. They don\u0027t want to turn it over to private insurers.Read Post | CommentsMaureen Costello, 05.26.2011Director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Teaching Tolerance projectIt\u0027s important for schools to have clear and comprehensive anti-bullying policies, but policies that target only the bad behavior will never solve the problem.Read Post | CommentsKelly Moore, 05.26.2011Former Spokesperson, UN Mission in BosniaI suppose I should be jumping for joy now that Mladic is in custody, but it\u0027s not that simple. His crimes are not a footnote in the history books for me. They are etched in the fabric of my soul and those of many of my friends.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 05.26.2011Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027Are men more like women and women more like men? Not really. What\u0027s changing is society; finally, slowly, getting out of the way of our ability to live the life we want, not the one others expect.Read Post | CommentsMeg Tilly, 05.26.2011Author/actressIf I can convince my daughter Emily to do a mother/daughter blog maybe it will make us close again. The way it used to be before things changed.Read Post | CommentsStephanie Schriock, 05.26.2011President, EMILY\u0027s ListDemocrats needed 25 House seats to send John Boehner and the Republicans back to the minority. Now it\u0027s 24. Turns out, engaging in a cradle to grave assault on American women is not a compelling electoral strategyRead Post | CommentsTony Schwartz, 05.26.2011President of The Energy Project; Author of Be Excellent at Anything: The Four Keys to Transforming the Way We Work and LiveWe each have one reservoir of will and discipline, and it gets progressively depleted by any act of conscious self-regulation. So if you spend energy trying to resist a fragrant chocolate chip cookie, you\u0027ll have less energy left over to solve a difficult problem.Read Post | CommentsRev. Al Sharpton, 05.26.2011President, National Action NetworkIf Kathy Hochul can win in a district that voted for John McCain in 2008, Democrats should look forward to retaining the coveted office of the Presidency in 2012 -- and maybe even taking back control of the House.Read Post | CommentsJohn Merrow, 05.26.2011Education Correspondent for PBS NewsHour; Author, \u0027The Influence of Teachers\u0027Is it possible that the U.S. has been heading in the wrong direction for most of the 30 years it has been focused on school reform?Read Post | CommentsJoel K. Goldstein, 05.26.2011Vincent C. Immel Professor of Law, Saint Louis University School of LawHubert H. Humphrey deserves to be remembered, on his centennial and always, for demonstrating that effective political action can forge national policy regulating individual behavior to make America a better and more just society.Read Post | CommentsGregory Jaczko, 05.26.2011Chairman, Nuclear Regulatory CommissionEnsuring nuclear safety is always challenging. We cannot guarantee the prevention of every possible accident and we seem to only make news when there are issues. But that is precisely our job -- to find problems and ensure they are resolved.Read Post | CommentsDennis Santiago, 05.26.2011CEO and Managing Director of IRAI\u0027ve been staring at the summary statistics for the industry today and file the following observations for those of you entertained by how this is all playing out.Read Post | CommentsAlex Fattal, 05.26.2011Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at Harvard UniversityIn the last moments of my mom\u0027s hunger strike, she began writhing in pain.

And in its effort to make one set of easy to understand rules, the government has oversimplified.Read Post | CommentsIra Chernus, 05.26.2011Professor of Religious Studies, University of Colorado at BoulderThe staggering power imbalance between occupier and occupied points to a looking-glass-style distortion: the absurd idea that Israel and Palestine could negotiate as equals.Read Post | CommentsTara Sophia Mohr, 2011.05.27Randy Taran, 2011.05.27MeiMei Fox, 2011.05.27Karen Dalton-Beninato, 2011.05.27Kisa Lala, 2011.05.27Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2011.05.27Marguerite Manteau-Rao, 2011.05.26Joah Spearman, 2011.05.26Dan Persons, 2011.05.26Hemanshu Nigam, 2011.05.26","h1":"Using a mobile device?
