{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostAmerica\u0027s history is filled with religious people, with the deep conviction that they are acting under the authority of God, promoting ideas that in retrospect seem impossibly oppressive. Kim Davis has already become a symbol for what is euphemistically called \"Freedom of Religion,\" which unfortunately in recent times has just become code for anti-LGBT bigotry. Instead of striving for a more inclusive world, she is going to jail in her desire to exclude. Instead of seeking justice for all, she was the obstacle to justice for gay couples. Her actions, although she claims they are guided by God and love, have bruised and hurt the very people she was elected to serve. If your love feels like hate then it is not love. If you are using God to denigrate and humiliate then it is not God.By loving our kids, and loving them unconditionally, we\u0027re giving them an enormous advantage. That love is a private gift that stands entirely outside of money, position and power.Editor-at-Large and former Executive Features Editor of The Huffington PostI am currently in Hungary, documenting the journeys of Syrian refugees, the very journey that today took another young life. It\u0027s easy to blame the parents for exposing their son to such deadly danger, but only if you forget the barrel bombs and Islamic State beheadings that they are fleeing.Director of the emergencies program at Human Rights WatchIf Ms. Davis can\u0027t bring herself, in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u0027s Obergefell decision, to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, then she should resign. That is her only option.Executive Director, First Amendment CoalitionObviously, Judge Richard Berman is not a die-hard New York football fan or if he is, he was able to put that bias aside. Even if you despise Tom Brady, the overturning of his suspension was the right legal decision.Television Correspondent and AttorneyWhat do you say during your last few minutes \"on Earth\"? Things will break. We will not. How I know that I just can\u0027t say. I think it\u0027s because we prefer to laugh more than we like just about anything else. Even science. Even being astronauts for a year during NASA\u0027s longest planned Mars simulation.Chief Medical Officer of HI-SEAS IV, Earth\u0027s longest simulated Mars mission. Physician, medical writer, science educator.This \"wave of people\" is more like a trickle when considered against the pool that must absorb it. The influx this year is only 0.068 percent of the EU\u0027s population. Before we get carried away by apocalyptic rhetoric, we should recognize that if there is a crisis, it is one of politics, not capacity.Executive director of Human Rights WatchBy continuing to invest in these and other proven interventions -- especially those aimed at saving newborns during their vulnerable first month -- we can use the next 15 years to cut the child-mortality rate by half again. But let\u0027s face it: What we really want for children -- for our own children, for anyone\u0027s children -- is not simply to survive, but to thrive.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationIn 2013, a U.S. Senate committee exposed the fact that too many federal contractors are violating federal wage laws and health and safety standards, yet continue to profit off of U.S. taxpayers with repeat contracts.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedSometimes the notes were wonderful, gossipy accounts of family life, reminding us that the ordinary and mundane is as beautiful and important as the dramatic and spectacular. And sometimes they were thoughtful, almost meditative reflections on our situation and how it had inspired them to act. I even got poetry.JournalistThe good news is that we\u0027re uniquely poised to achieve dramatic progress toward many of the ambitious targets of SDG3. Right now, we have a once-in-human-history opportunity to achieve what we are calling a \"grand convergence\" in global health.Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard UniversityProfessor of the Practice of Global Health and Public Policy at Duke University, and a member of The Lancet CommissionI was miserable, so I decided to take a break from drinking to see if my life would improve. Now I haven\u0027t had a drink in 40 days and here are six ways I feel that my life has improved since.A 22 year old psychology student, puppy momma and blogger on www.liv-light.orgEurope cannot close its doors to people who are fleeing war and persecution, as this would entail betraying the fundamental values which make it a model worldwide. Barbed wire fences will also tear at the fabric of its soul.President of the Chamber of Deputies, ItalyWhether it\u0027s denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples or denial of reproductive health care to women, the trend of conflating individual religious beliefs with public policy decisions is a slippery and dangerous slope to the erosion of genuine religious libertyEpiscopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.Still, 6.3 million children continue to die each year in their first month of life. That\u0027s nearly 17,000 each and every day. Most of these deaths can easily be prevented.President, Save the Children Action NetworkThe most recent Planned Parenthood fetal tissue videos, I must admit, were initially jarring. I can see why people would be upset. I am a pro-choice woman, on the side of life, who has supported Planned Parenthood both vocally and financially for over a decade. I am determined to continue to do so.Political Activist, Social Change Media Maker, Prepper and Mom.Her personal decision doesn\u0027t mean that millions of other women will be forced to follow in her footsteps. Instead, let\u0027s hope that her example pushes other companies to work out more and various solutions for expectant moms and dads.President \u0026 Editor-in-Chief, HollywoodLife.comThe solution to the immigration crisis that is engulfing the old continent should not be left only in the hands of those at the emergency summit called by the European Commission. This problem must involve the greater share of the governments on the planet.Award-winning Cuban bloggerWhether it is Black Lives Matter who demand to be heard or others, Fox News will attempt to shout down the movement to protect their cherished vision of a monochrome America, instead of the messy, rigidly stratified America that so many face.bookkeeper, political observer, chess enthusiastPositing the blame solely on a vocal, but still small group of individuals who voice these concerns, calling this a \"movement\" in order to fan the flames of reaction, and slapping them with a dismissive label only makes matters worse.Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityIn the post-Jenner world, with multiple mainstream media outlets covering trans stories with increasing degrees of accuracy and respect, we are now faced with the question of who are the gatekeepers to that history. Who gets to tell the story which will become the accepted and acceptable narrative for the rest of the world?Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandI felt the pressure to fit into the gowns I saw as I flipped through bridal magazines. Every photograph I looked at seemed to promote skin-tight satin and buttoned-up bodices. How would a backless gown look with a colossal surgical scar running down my back?Actress, musician, teacher, composer, dancer, writer, artist, yogi, foodie and general lover of lifeGiven the significant invasion of privacy occasioned by the use of drones by law enforcement, warrants should be mandatory before using them for surveillance. And weaponized drones of any sort should be outlawed.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawHow was Santorum able to take peer-reviewed scientific research and distort it beyond recognition? To understand how science can get distorted, you need to understand the techniques of science denial.Researcher in climate communication at The University of QldWe know Latinos are often the ones who need access to affordable health care the most, but are the least likely to have access to it. Latinos continue to have the lowest rate of health care coverage of any ethnic group -- one quarter of us are uninsured.Working to empower the Latino community nationwide.Some men shy away from the nursing field because of the perception that nursing is a female-dominated field. But, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the proportion of male nurses has increased significantly over the years. As a male nurse myself, here are nine things that I have learned along the way.My wife and enjoy our time with our kids, but not all of our time, especially when we\u0027re traveling. Having the kids in school allows us to do some stress-free sightseeing, go for longer walks, exercise, and rest.Writer, Creator of LiveFamilyTravel.comOnce upon a time I was a refugee who, unlike many of my relatives, was fortunate to escape persecution and genocide. Despite the refugee crisis being the largest humanitarian one since World War II, the UN has done little other than decry Europe\u0027s belated and confused response to the problem.Nonresident Fellow, Brookings InstitutionYou already know about the worst types of people on Instagram. Sometimes, though, an otherwise lovely account is marred by a misstep: a cringe-worthy pic that was probably better off remaining in your camera roll forever. Here, 15 photos to avoid posting. Your followers will thank you.The women\u0027s lifestyle destinationNobody enjoys anxiety. But for most, it is something that people deal with from time to time and is usually linked to a stressful event in their lives.
