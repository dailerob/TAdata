{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature at YaleThe security policy of the U.S. government from Cheney to Obama has passed from secret surveillance of communications abroad to secret surveillance of all communications at home. In what stages did it happen? Some day the history will be written; for now, it is instructive to rehearse the facts. Five years ago, Barack Obama was a candidate for president who pledged to filibuster a congressional bill that offered amnesty to telecoms that illegally gave information on American customers to the government. When Obama backed down from that promise, he pledged, if elected, to have his attorney general investigate the surveillance of Americans and bring the laws of the land back within the limits of the fourth amendment. As it turned out, he made Eric Holder his attorney general, and the security policy of the Obama administration came to be defined by harsh prosecution of whistleblowers who revealed the facts of illegal searches and seizures.CommentsArianna HuffingtonWhat we need is a more humane and more sustainable definition of success that includes well-being, wisdom, wonder, empathy, and the ability to give back. And women will have to lead the way.Comments (209)Anne-Marie SlaughterBert G. Kerstetter \u002766 University Professor of Politics and International Affairs, Princeton UniversityThe ability to operate effectively in a horizontal web of relationships (a network of networks) is more important than ever. So why is it that the metric of success is still \"getting to the top\"?Comments (33)Mika BrzezinskiCo-host of MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\"Somewhat aspirational. I loved it. Didn\u0027t know what it meant. But I found it to be hilarious and cuttingly honest, which I admire. I considered getting a T-shirt with the words typed out across my chest.Comments (115)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowMorton Downey succeeded where earlier talkers like Wally George and Bob Grant failed. He turned conservatism into both a rock concert and professional wrestling theater. Out of this innovative mash-up came the slick, in-your-face production values and jingoism of Fox News Channel.Comments (45)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI am fond of telling people that I became a journalist because I wanted to make a difference. Actually, what I wanted to do was change the world. I suppose to some whose stories I\u0027ve told over the past 40 years, I have made a difference. But the goal of changing the world didn\u0027t come from my typewriter; it came from the decision to adopt two older special needs kids from China.Comments (14)Nathan J. WinogradDirector, No Kill Advocacy CenterAt a time of climate change, in a country that needs more trees, not less, nativists in the San Francisco Bay Area are proposing the clear cutting of upwards of half a million trees as part of their ongoing war against the Eucalyptus.Comments (91)Dan Treadway and Seamus McKiernanThere is a chance that you might be put in a situation in the next couple of weeks in which you\u0027ll have to watch one of the games of the NBA Finals -- the horror! So here\u0027s a quick guide that will hopefully improve the viewing experience for the not-so-much-sports-inclined.CommentsKristen Breitweiser9/11 widow and activistFor years during the Bush administration, many groups fought against the Patriot Act and its illegal surveillance of U.S. citizens. They were horrified by torture and extraordinary renditions. They fought for the sanctity and protection of whistleblowers. Where are these people now?Comments (161)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupJeremy Scahill\u0027s new documentary, Dirty Wars, is a cinematic chronicle of one journalist\u0027s investigation into America\u0027s secret global campaign of targeted killings. It raises a stark question: Is Team Obama\u0027s aggressive expansion of drone strikes and night raids doing more harm than good?Comments (93)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsMark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVTV manufacturers are making YouTube a core part of their application offerings. Their expectation is that YouTube will be a destination for video that will compete with traditional TV.CommentsKirk DouglasActorWe have become a cowboy country with too many guns. I am 96 years old. I have many grandchildren. I would hate to leave them a world where guns are easily accessible.Comments (1,983)John DearChristian peace activist, author of \u0027Lazarus, Come Forth!\u0027 and \u0027A Persistent Peace.\u0027 www.johndear.org, blogs at www.ncronline.orgManning was horrified by the killing of civilians and believed that war crimes were being covered up, so he took action. That does not make him a war criminal.CommentsSusan LandauAuthor, \"Surveillance or Security? The Risks Posed by New Wiretapping Technologies\"The invasiveness of this data is hard to underestimate. It is data that reveals where every connected person is during the day, with whom they speak, when, how often.CommentsRonna BenjaminManaging Editor/Boston www.betterafter50.comWhat makes for a happy, healthy life? I sought pearls of wisdom from my 99-year-old Bubbe. She is healthy by most standards, though I wouldn\u0027t go so far as to say she is \u0027happy\u0027 -- that is a tough word when you are 99. My Bubbe is best characterized as \u0027satisfied.\u0027Comments (12)DJ Louie XIVDJThese \"guilty pleasures\" are all-too-often tied to culture items that have been embraced by a mainstream audience and get erroneously filed away as \"guilty pleasures\" solely for their popularity.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeSummer is almost here, so why not entertain your friends and family with a beach blast, laid back and casual yet with just the right touch of chic?CommentsSen. Robert MenendezChairman, Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeThe tragedy at the Rana Plaza clothing factory was a sober reminder that Bangladeshi garment workers still lack basic rights and protections. My mother was a seamstress. She worked in the textile factories of northern New Jersey. I saw how hard and tiring her work was. But it was never lethal. And it shouldn\u0027t be.CommentsConrad BlackAuthor and HistorianOn the evening of June 5, 1944, as Roosevelt spoke to the world about the liberation of Rome, and welcomed Italy back into the civilized world, Churchill and de Gaulle were having the most severe of all their many disputes.Comments (24)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThose obsessing about deficits never cared so much about deficits. They use deficits and debt to further their shrink-the-government agenda. In that context, the fact that the deficit numbers no longer support their four-alarm-fire messaging strategy is but a minor inconvenience.Comments (12)Jim DownsAssociate Professor of History and American Studies, Connecticut CollegeOn one level, I recognize how this is a highly charged political throw down between two oppressed groups that rarely get the national microphone. I then worry about activists, regardless of their political stripes, disrespecting Mrs. Obama more than other first ladies.Comments (179)Mike Weisser\u0027The Gun Guy\u0027 at EvolveThe Illinois legislature has just passed a concealed-carry bill and the governor may have no choice but to sign it into law. The law has parts that are silly, parts that are stupid, and parts that are just bizarre. Did the folks in Springfield even read the bill before they voted?CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911\"Living debt free\" is a nice slogan, and beyond that it\u0027s something we should all aspire to. Unfortunately, some people couple this concept with living credit free. That is a far different story.Comments (14)Abby HeugelAward-winning humor writer, blogger and editor\"I\u0027m just a fungi with high morels looking to shoot the shiitake with a cute little button like you.\" And other perishable personal ads you won\u0027t hear on Craig\u0027s List.CommentsRaymond A. Smith, Ph.D.Adjunct Assistant Professor of Political Science, Columbia and NYU; Senior Fellow, Progressive Policy InstituteAs we await word from the Supreme Court about the future of same-sex marriage, it\u0027s increasingly common to hear how allegedly \"swift,\" \"unprecedented,\" and \"accelerated\" the advance of gay rights has been. This line of argument does an injustice to the depth of LGBTQ history.Comments (14)The Produce BoxFresh produce delivery serviceThat\u0027s when I realized The Produce Box could really be a force for change. We were changing the conversation about food in our community, and our Facebook Page was an extension of that dialogue. Today, our members gather there to share their stories and lessons about the nutritious foods on their dinner tables.CommentsMike SpohrExecutive Director, Friends of MaddieIt was only as I left the PICU that I felt humanity. There, sitting on a chair with a single tear rolling down her cheek, was my nurse. Her tear told me that she cared. About Heather, about me, and most importantly, about my beautiful Maddie.Comments (125)Davis SchneidermanAuthor, \u0027Drain\u0027 and \u0027Blank: A Novel\u0027Nostalgia possesses a dangerous power.
