{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The road to political and economic ruin for the Democrats began in the late spring of 2013, when President Obama agreed to a budget grand bargain that cut deficits by 2.8 trillion dollars over ten years, deflated a fragile recovery, and left no room for more than token domestic spending on jobs or infrastructure. The cuts were somewhat \"back-loaded\" -- bigger later in the decade. But in 2014 they took $200 billion out of the budget. According to CBO, that cut the growth rate by a full percentage point. As part of the deal, more Medicare costs were shifted to patients, and the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security was cut. Both changes, proposed in Obama\u0027s own budget, reduced purchasing power by over $100 billion among the elderly -- who surprised experts by backing Republicans by a margin of 59-41, according to exit polls. The 2013 budget deal, according to Roger Hickey of Campaign for America\u0027s Future, \"left the Democrats with bragging rights as deficit hawks, but not on the real economy.\"CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI felt bad for the Microsoft Store. The devices and accessories looked sharp and smart. But they were heavy to hold and didn\u0027t work as advertised.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOA frail 94-year-old Nelson Mandela has again been admitted to hospital. On a prior occasion a year ago, I felt it important to write about this exceptional and unique man whose achievements should inspire many, and for a very long time. My already high respect for Mr. Mandela has only grown in the last year.Comments (19)Susan PattonExecutive Coach, Human Resources Consultant, BloggerThe extreme reaction to my letter is astonishing. Honestly, it was intended as little more than honest advice from a Jewish mother.Comments (317)Michael HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupIf it were up to me, I\u0027d hand the Iron Throne to Daenyrus in the end. Sure, she\u0027s completely mental, but isn\u0027t that what you want in a sovereign? Telling her she can\u0027t rule the Seven Kingdoms would be like telling Anna Wintour she can\u0027t edit Vogue magazine.Comments (12)Dr. James HansenClimatologistHumanity\u0027s Faustian climate bargain is well known. Humans have been pumping both greenhouse gases (mainly CO2) and aerosols (fine particles) into the atmosphere for more than a century. Is the new data we present here good news or bad news, and how does it alter the \"Faustian bargain\"?CommentsGordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationPakistan is today counting the costs of a week of carnage in which teachers and pupils have been violently attacked simply because they want to go to school. As pupils gathered at the Baldia Town School this morning for an awards ceremony, grenades were hurled into the building and then shots rang out.Comments (48)Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityConformity, whether rationalized or simply imposed, undermines our government, our press, and our educational systems. We\u0027ve had to learn some hard lessons about this in the last 10 years. Surely one of them is that we must defend diversity as a tool for innovation and for responsible decision-making.Comments (38)HuffPost Radiohigh feature.-DTIts \"Autopsy\" notwithstanding, Reagan \u0026 Frum discuss a possible Grand New Party\" on gay rights or guns post-Sup Ct and Newtown. Can it escape Evangelical and NRA stridency? Then: North Korea \u0026 North Dakota are both bluffing like crazy.CommentsFrank SchaefferNew York Times best-selling authorMom was a wonderful paradox: an evangelical conservative fundamentalist who treated people as if she was an all-forgiving progressive liberal of the most tolerant variety. RIP Edith SchaefferComments (53)Emma JohnsonWealthySingleMommy.comOver the past few years, I\u0027ve had interesting discussions around the question, \"Should you say \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 when someone reveals they\u0027re getting divorced?\"Comments (108)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityWe are spending tens of billions of dollars plying the worried well with unnecessary and expensive drugs; while at the very same time ignoring the desperate needs of those who really could benefit from psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.Comments (33)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterOne of the most effective methods to triumph over fear is to cease mentally aggrandizing the object of your fear.CommentsThe Pet CollectiveYour daily source for cute, funny, informative, and heartwarming original videosIt is shocking to know that in Los Angeles County alone, 200 pit bulls are put down every single day, because there are not enough homes for them. Imagine how that number grows when you think of all the cities, in all the states, across the country.Comments (12)Michael BroderSame-sex-married, HIV-positive freelance writer, teacher and thinker in Bed-Stuy, BrooklynHow, if at all, should we reconcile the dictates of public health policy with the social, cultural and political concerns and sensitivities of specific populations? Another way of putting this is to ask whether the DOH recommendations are \"good for the gays.\"Comments (25)Don McNayBestselling author. Newest book: \u0027Life Lessons From the Lottery: Protecting Your Money in a Scary World\u0027Most people are afraid of change. They want affirmation from \"what everyone else is doing\" and don\u0027t want to spend the time and effort to keep on educating themselves. I\u0027ve been as guilty of that as anyone.CommentsJohn BlumenthalFormer Playboy editor/Novelist/Screenwriter(\u0027Blue Streak\u0027)All women expect you to act like a gentleman but the definition of that word has become decidedly cloudy in today\u0027s complicated world.CommentsMinnow HamiltonEditor and Chief Curator, SavvyMom MediaWe\u0027re not saying you need to make big changes to your diet, but sometimes small changes can make a big difference.CommentsMark Brennan RosenbergAuthor, \u0027Blackouts and Breakdowns\u0027, \u0027Eating My Feelings\u0027Since being gay is a choice, I decided when I woke up today I would be straight. Here\u0027s what happened.CommentsRajan MenonProfessor of Political Science, City College of New York/City University of New York; Non Resident Senior Fellow, The Atlantic CouncilWar cries, threats and counter-threats, moves and counter-moves are emanating from the Korean peninsula. Pundits have pronounced on what\u0027s going on and where things are headed. So this may be a good time to engage in some humility and to reflect on how little we know.Comments (41)David MischAuthor, \"Funny: The Book\"Not just satire but comedy itself begins with mocking. Plato and Aristotle said all laughter was wrong because comedy is inherently cruel (something many people still believe, especially me when I think about Ken Magnuson in 8th grade gym class).CommentsSarah Juliet LauroVisiting assistant professor, Clemson UniversityIf you have a justification for violence, destruction, murder, like a political statement, like war, does that make it right? Or does thinking it\u0027s right make you crazy?CommentsBrian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe legendary, yet humble, recording genius Phil Ramone, 72, whose influence across a stunning spectrum of popular music for decades has passed away in New York.

And then a GOP leader will say something like this: \"My father had a ranch. We used to have 50 to 60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes.\"CommentsElizabeth BirchPresident, Elizabeth Birch Company/Global OutI came to understand I was uniquely positioned to make a contribution (as are all gay people in these historic times) because I appreciated the unique gift of being born gay. I always \"leaned in\" by coming out and staying out.CommentsJohn FarrEditor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comGoing all the way back to Homer\u0027s Odyssey, some of our finest stories take place on voyages or quests of some kind, where our hero (or heroine) not only experiences new sights and adventures, but also some transformation in thinking, circumstance, or attitude as a result. The road movie is the cinematic equivalent.Comments (18)Penny LoveFitness/Lifestyle CoachMr. Ronson\u0027s talk was not all shivers.
