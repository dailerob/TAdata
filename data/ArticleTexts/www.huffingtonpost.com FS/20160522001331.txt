{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressAs you may have heard, for the first time in the storied history of Las Vegas, plans went awry. Last weekend, the Nevada Democratic convention turned into a raucous fracas as Democrats met to finalize the process of selecting delegates. During the proceedings, supporters of Bernie Sanders formed the opinion that those in charge were manipulating the rules in a way that benefited Hillary Clinton. Now, in the aftermath, a two-pronged media narrative has crystallized. Has the Democratic Party’s primary become historically acrimonious? Can Sanders prevent the party from fracturing fatally? On this week’s podcast, we discuss how this narrative is not only overhyped, but gets the issue of who is responsible for future reconciliations backward.Sanders\u0027 intentions are not a secret.

What got lost was the bill they were debating, Bill C-14, the government\u0027s assisted-dying legislation.
