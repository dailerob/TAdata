Just wrong.Read Post | CommentsJohann Hari, 05.13.2010Columnist, London IndependentElections are supposed to be an opportunity for the people to express the direction in which they want the country to travel.

Wedel, 05.13.2010There was much finger-pointing this week, but the politicians, and our entire leadership, should also point a finger at themselves, for allowing private industry to increasingly devour public power, and gut regulatory responsibility.Read Post | CommentsDr. Jon LaPook, 05.13.2010Medical correspondent for the CBS Evening News with Katie CouricThe pill that ushered in the sexual revolution may have also thrown cold water on women\u0027s libido.Read Post | CommentsMichael Kieschnick, 05.13.2010President of CREDO MobileSome politicians and environmental organizations are using the Gulf Coast tragedy to push for passage of this flawed bill. To hear their arguments, you\u0027d think the bill adds important safeguards and limits to offshore drilling.Read Post | CommentsErnest Istook, 05.12.2010Distinguished Fellow, The Heritage FoundationFor everyday Americans, the new climate bill is nothing to cheer, as it amounts to nothing more than a giant new energy tax.Read Post | CommentsRobert Auerbach, 05.13.2010Professor, Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs, The University of Texas at AustinSenator Bernie Sanders\u0027 amendment for a partial audit of the Federal Reserve\u0027s operations by the Government Accountability Office still needs an important requirement that it is currently lacking.Read Post | CommentsWilliam Bradley, 05.13.2010California-based Political Analyst NewWestNotes.comIron Man 2, entertaining as it is, and I like it, is a big missed opportunity. It could have been a lighter version of The Dark Knight, exploring deeper themes in a pop context with a more congenial cast.
