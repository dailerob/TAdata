Assuming that Mitt Romney keeps self-destructing and Obama wins a second term, who should succeed him? Just as Obama\u0027s choice in 2008 of an economic team led by Larry Summers and Tim Geithner told you a lot about what kind of president he\u0027d be (and not be), Obama will signal a lot in his selection of Geithner\u0027s replacement.
