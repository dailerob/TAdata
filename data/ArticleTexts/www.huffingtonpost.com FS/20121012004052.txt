{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"In the last month, the United States hit three milestones in the war in Afghanistan. In late September, the 33,000 additional soldiers that President Obama ordered to Afghanistan in late 2009 came home. The number of U.S. soldiers killed reached 2,000. And this past Sunday marked the 11th anniversary of the longest war in American history. But the war has barely come up during a campaign that already seems interminable. Even though our presence in Afghanistan is a big drain on America\u0027s budget, in the first presidential debate last week the word came up exactly once. Will it come up in the vice-presidential debate tonight? It will of course come up on October 22nd, when the presidential debate is devoted to foreign policy. But there most likely won\u0027t be any actual debate. Because the one milestone the U.S. has not yet hit is the answer to the question: Why on earth are we still there?Read Post | Comments (69)Jason Linkins and Elyse Siegel, 10/11/12Every single vice-presidential debate that ever was has been sold as the one that really matters, but this year, the people who always say that are saying it even louder and more emphatically than ever.

He\u0027s less polished and aggressive than Romney, even soft-spoken. And he acts as if he\u0027s saying reasonable things. But under the surface he\u0027s a right-wing zealot.Read Post | Comments (588)Chris Weigant, 10/10/12Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comTomorrow night\u0027s debate should prove to be a fascinating one. It may get downright brutal at times. Both Ryan and Biden are fully capable of going for the jugular, and the Obama team knows it is in a slump.Read Post | Comments (17)Mehmet Oz, M.D., 10/10/12Vice-Chair and Professor of Surgery at Columbia University, author, radio and TV show hostThe scary truth is that many women don\u0027t know they have HPV.
