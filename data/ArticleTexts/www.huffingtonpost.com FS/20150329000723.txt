{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundUnder New York’s juvenile justice system a child as young as seven can be arrested for a crime, and a 16-year-old is automatically charged as an adult. These laws are shockingly behind the times -- bad for children and bad for public safety. New York is one of only four states to create a juvenile jurisdiction for little children who are barely old enough to shed their baby teeth and still believe in the Tooth Fairy. And they are expected to have the cognitive development necessary to participate in and understand a trial? Ignoring the evidence-based interventions proven to reduce recidivism and continuing to ship teens off to crime school (adult prison) are mistakes we can’t afford to keep making.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) is now apparently undecided how he\u0027ll buy insurance, backing away from his Obamacare announcement earlier in the week.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027The \"Grow Your Value\" bonus competition drives home the message that it is important for women to both learn their value and communicate it effectively.Co-host, MSNBC’s \u0027Morning Joe\u0027The idea that there\u0027s plenty of money to pay the athletes a salary largely comes from the existing system of surrogate pay and superfluous expenditure that currently exists. If the athletes get salaries, then the coaches no longer get the proxy pay -- and one cost offsets the other.Author of \u0027Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and World Cup\u0027You might be thinking, \"Amelia, this isn\u0027t going to go anywhere. It\u0027s California! It\u0027s not like it\u0027s going to become law.\" And you are right. But it doesn\u0027t take away from the fact that there are thousands of people in this country just like Mr. McLaughlin, who think a bullet in his head is exactly what my son deserves.Mother, wife, breadwinnerA key section of the secret Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement has been leaked to the public. The New York Times has a major story on the contents of the leaked chapter, and it\u0027s as bad as many of us feared. Now we know why the corporations and the Obama administration want the TPP kept secret from the public until it\u0027s too late to stop it.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureOnce more, we must courageously embrace Nonviolence 365, which is based on my father\u0027s nonviolent philosophy and methodology, as the answer to the \"crucial political and moral questions of our time,\" and not as a mere response to incidents but as a lifestyle and a force for good that permeates our culture, including our media and entertainment.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterBEIRUT -- With the Iranian involvement against ISIS in the assault on Tikrit, and the Saudi invasion of Yemen to stem the tide of Iranian influence, we have entered a new Middle Eastern war.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027That the Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel have fought for their rights for 67 years and continue to advance in their struggle gives me hope. As we approach this years\u0027 \"Land Day,\" keep your eyes on this remarkable community. They do, indeed, point the way forward.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027It\u0027s been freezing in Washington for the past few months, but it wasn\u0027t the nuclear winter some predicted when Sen. Harry Reid ushered in the most important changes to Senate procedure in a generation.Policy Counsel, Common CauseSome editors at the New York Times seem to have either developed a severe case of institutional amnesia, or decided to confer the presumption of innocence upon cellphone radiation, as the newspaper did upon asbestos for an entire decade after the mineral had been shown to be the most important industrial carcinogen in the world.Fmr. staff writer at The New YorkerSpeech policing advocates forget that there is incredible value in knowing what people actually think, unfiltered. Believing you can conquer racism, bias and bigotry by rooting out microaggressions and enforcing self-censorship and uptightness is like taking Xanax for syphilis.President, Foundation for Individual Rights in EducationPatrick Fuller is a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School\u0027s esteemed Division of Sleep Medicine. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on the importance of good sleep hygiene, how our brain\u0027s clock is connected to our overall well-being, and the problem with sleeping pills.Six months after Ayotzinapa, the haze of protest fever has cleared, and the long, difficult road to change has come into focus. The pragmatic questions Mexico must ask itself in order to arrive there are ugly. But--short of a revolution--this strategic approach is the only way for Mexico to generate change from below, giving voice at last to the many victims of its ongoing violence.Fulbright-García Robles FellowI thought more about the word. It\u0027s everywhere. Often not even beeped out of television shows, \"bitch\" is in rap songs and pop songs and on t-shirts. \"It\u0027s Britney, bitch.\" \"I\u0027m in Miami, bitch.\"Senior Editor, HuffPost LAI never wanted to be Barbie. I chose Ken every time. Same goes for playing house; I was never the mother or the daughter; I was always the dad or the son.Wife of a Soldier. Mother to 3 boys. Athlete and sports fan. Admirer of strong, inspiring women. Writer and Founder of TheSidelined.com.These next few years, as hard as they might be for you, will pass quickly. I know you want to end it all right now; I know you feel like it\u0027s the only thing that will stop the pain. But you have NO idea how wonderful the future is going to be!Speaker * Writer * Mentor * ActivistAll of these desserts are perfect for Passover and most of them are gluten-free. But you don\u0027t need a holiday to enjoy these sweet treats: they are delicious any day, any time.Chef, Recipe Developer, Busy MomFor all emergency conditions, especially when we don\u0027t have heat and hot water in the winter, HPD should improve their response: inspectors must be dispatched in less than 24 hours and must notify landlords of the violation immediately and the requirement to make the repair within 24 hours; fine owners when the repair is not made within 24 hours.Adjunct faculty, George Mason University\u0027s School for Conflict Analysis and ResolutionOn my Tumblr blog I\u0027ve gotten creepy messages, and had my personal photos posted on ebony fetish blogs. Some might say that the solution to avoiding this kind behavior is to delete my blog or my profile, to block the guys I don\u0027t like and focus on the ones I do.As a public service, here\u0027s a cheat sheet for you, so when you hear these statements, you know why they\u0027re just not right.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIt is some sort of amazing Jedi mind trick -- citizens and taxpayers are looking right past the causes of schools\u0027 financial problems and deciding to blame it all on local school boards.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comThe wealthier you are and the more you care about yourself over your neighbor or your country, the more you\u0027ll like this Republican budget. It achieves balance entirely on the backs of middle-class families and our most vulnerable citizens, without asking billionaires or big corporations to pay -- forget a fair share -- one penny more toward our nation\u0027s prosperity.Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandWhen you throw sleep deprivation on top of some already unpleasant symptoms, you\u0027re practically guaranteed to feel less than optimal for the next few months. The good news is that with a little bit of effort, you can turn your bedroom into an allergen-free zone -- and get more of the symptom-free rest you crave. Here\u0027s how.Entrepreneur, CEO at One Mall GroupMy mother told me I was pretty all my life because she never would have thought otherwise. She didn\u0027t insist I was pretty because she was obsessed with looks. She insisted because I was her daughter.Actor, dancerThere are many kinds of regrets that people have and then feel trapped by within their current lives. That becomes more acute as you enter the middle years. But consider this: If you\u0027re able to feel regret to begin with, then that very feeling, that awareness, suggests that you\u0027re probably not the same person you were back then.Business psychologist and psychotherapist; director, Center for Progressive DevelopmentIt all comes down to choosing the right veil. Think the waltz is just a dance step? The chapel only a place to say your vows? Could it really be that easy? Check our glossary to find out.The go-to guide for all things weddingsThe truth is coming out and Netanyahu\u0027s attempts to correct his errors will do little to change what the world has now finally come to understand, namely that Israel is neither a democracy nor that its five-decades old occupation of four million Palestinians is the fault of the occupied rather than the occupier.Palestinian journalistI love RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race and Modern Family as much as the next gay viewer. But let\u0027s be real here: these shows exist to make us smile and laugh. They do not ask us to critically examine our bodies, existence and behaviors.Writer and Young Professional in New York CityI\u0027ve just been invited to an exclusive club. It\u0027s not the Soho House. It\u0027s not the Illuminati. It\u0027s not even Costco.
