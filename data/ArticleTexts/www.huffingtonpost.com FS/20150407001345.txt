Look at any legislative effort to improve the environment, or wages and working conditions, or to secure rights, and you find organized corporate power on the other side. If America has become the sort of society where regular people are insecure and the Tea Party rebellion is one of the reactions, the corporate domination of our democracy is one of the major causes. So the corporate big shots get to win both ways. They dominate the process of rule-setting that leads to a very frustrated 99 percent -- and once in a while a few of them get to play the role of enlightened, endearing moderate.Roughly half of the 10,600 American troops were supposed to leave by the end of the year, with the rest scheduled to depart in 2016.
