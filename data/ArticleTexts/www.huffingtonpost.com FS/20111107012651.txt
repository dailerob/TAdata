{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the New York Post became utterly unhinged over Occupy Wall Street, Grover Norquist ricocheted between being \"the most powerful man in America\" (ask Alan Simpson) and \"some random person in America\" (ask John Boehner), and Kim Kardashian failed to live happily ever after -- or even happily after 72 days. On the GOP campaign trail, Rick Perry tried to explain going all gooey over a bottle of maple syrup, Herman Cain gave a master\u0027s course in how not to handle a sex scandal, and Mitt Romney replaced Lou Gehrig as the luckiest man on the face of the earth. Meanwhile, the Party of No lived down to its name as Senate Republicans obstructed another piece of the president\u0027s jobs bill, blocking $60 billion targeted to patching up America\u0027s crumbling infrastructure -- earning the undying support of gaping potholes, collapsing bridges, and derailed trains all across the country. Andy Rooney would have had a field day mocking that one.Read Post | Comments (143)Howard Fineman, 11/4/11Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupIf only the congressional super committee held its secret deliberations in a booth at the Tune Inn, we would have a deal well before the third pitcher of Natty Boh was served.Read Post | Comments (139)Matt Damon and Gary White, 11/1/11Even today, as solutions are known and available, lack of access to safe water and sanitation continues to claim more lives through disease than any war claims through guns.Read Post | Comments (613)Arianna Huffington, 11/2/11Everyone in Washington now wants to be caught trying to do something about the jobs crisis.

El-Erian, 10/31/11CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAmerican policymakers, together with their European counterparts, are realizing something that Japan has been experiencing for a while: It is very difficult to manage well an economy hobbled by structural impediments and balance sheet excesses.Read Post | Comments (300)Marlo Thomas, 10/31/11Award-winning actress; Author; ActivistIn case you need reminding from when you were a kid -- kids keep secrets from their parents.

To some degree, this is an understandable reaction to the disappointments of the Bush presidency. But what is understandable is not necessarily right.Read Post | Comments (515)Dylan Ratigan, 11/4/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027If belief in the integrity of the Supreme Court frays, the Court\u0027s power will fray as well. This is in no one\u0027s interest. We need a system of justice, but a system of justice that serves all of us.Read Post | Comments (659)Dr. Andrew Weil, 11/4/11Founder and director, The Arizona Center for Integrative MedicineThe dramatic rise in depression diagnoses over the last two decades is a great challenge to modern medicine.
