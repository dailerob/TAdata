{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostOn Monday the credit-rating agency Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s upgraded its outlook for the credit rating of the United States to \"stable.\" Which is terrible news for the credit rating of the United States. That is because S\u0026P has proven itself to be more or less clueless about the prospects for U.S. debt, among other things. From the moment S\u0026P downgraded the U.S. debt rating to AA from AAA in August 2011, U.S. debt has surged 14 percent in value, and U.S. stocks (embodied by, ironically, the S\u0026P 500) have gained 37 percent. S\u0026P has lifted its outlook on the U.S. just as bond prices are starting to fall, and the stock market\u0027s recent run has hit some roadblocks. Great timing!Comments (46)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupIt was inevitable that tonight\u0027s Season 3 finale of \"Game of Thrones\" would feel anticlimactic, not just because last week\u0027s Red Wedding was so traumatic, but also because there were so many loose ends to tie up.Comments (576)Michael CalderoneSenior Media Reporter, The Huffington PostThe Guardian has labeled Edward Snowden a whistleblower after the NSA contractor revealed himself Sunday as the source for several recent surveillance scoops. But some news organization have been less quick to describe Snowden as a \"whistleblower,\" opting instead for terms like \"source\" or \"leaker.\"Comments (242)Jeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027This is a story about transparency and the lack of it. It is a story about secrecy and its damages. It is a story about principles that are being flouted. I am asking for government to behave according to principles. I am also asking companies to do so.Comments (105)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Conservative Republicans in our nation\u0027s capital have managed to accomplish something they only dreamed of when Tea Partiers streamed into Congress at the start of 2011: They\u0027ve basically shut Congress down.Comments (1,245)Barbara SlavinSenior Fellow, Atlantic Council\u0027s South Asia CenterIranian elections are hardly free or fair by Western standards. But even with limited choices and a heavily securitized environment, the brief presidential campaign is providing an outlet for harsh criticism of the status quo, including topics that are usually banished from public discourse.Comments (105)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe solutions to many of the nation\u0027s problems boil down to empowerment, leadership, organization, commitment, follow-up and determination -- a critical combination that seems to continuously evade our elected representatives on Capitol Hill these days.CommentsNorman LearFounder, People for the American WayWith all there is to care about in this world, why does a star of Tom Cruise\u0027s magnitude choose to hie off to a remote land to say nice things about a group of stores he isn\u0027t likely to be caught alive in? Clearly, Tom was there because he cared, and that fills me with wonder.Comments (85)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarStriving for gender equality both in and out of the workplace doesn\u0027t mean women should be striving to emulate, \"overtake,\" or actually be men. Whatever women choose to do -- hug, kiss, handshake -- it\u0027s key to embrace the choice and approach the movement with confidence and ease.Comments (74)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027As China has demonstrated for more than a generation, \"free trade\" is a useful American fantasy, and state-led capitalism is not a contradiction in terms. It is a recipe for hollowing out the U.S. economy in favor of Chinese economic primacy.Comments (172)Vali NasrDean, Johns Hopkins University\u0027s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International StudiesThe Obama administration has neither come up with a strategy for capitalizing on the opportunity that the Arab Spring presented nor adequately prepared for potential fallout in the form of regional rivalry, the explosion of sectarian tensions and deep-rooted economic crises.Comments (53)Murray LippSocial justice activistDOMA prevents legally married same-sex couples from accessing 1,138 federal rights and benefits associated with marriage. Here are five examples of how the lives of same-sex couples would be improved if the Supreme Court strikes down Section 3 of DOMA.Comments (44)Amy WrubleBlogger, \"Carriage Before Marriage\"After a few years of not being able to read the fine print, I broke down and bought my first pair of reading glasses. It was like the reverse of a teen nervously buying condoms. \"First pair of reading glasses,\" I informed the clerk, just to prove that I\u0027m not at all embarrassed. \"My mom wears those,\" she smiled. And now I\u0027m mortified.Comments (53)Menachem RosensaftProfessor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsThose of us who admire all that Samantha Power has already accomplished in the human rights arena and believe her to be an inspired choice as UN ambassador must speak out on her behalf.Comments (45)Sanjay SanghoeeBanker, political and business commentator; author of \u0027Killing Wall Street\u0027 (www.killingwallstreet.com)The Billionaire\u0027s Apprentice: The Rise of the Indian-American Elite and the Fall of the Galleon Hedge Fund is a seminal work that captures the realities of race and greed in America with refreshing objectivity and efficiency, and a book that everyone should read.CommentsEdward WassermanDean, UC Berkeley Graduate School of JournalismGoogle Glass promises a brazen and routine simultaneity of experience, an ability to interact seamlessly with the here and now without losing rich Web-enabled connectivity -- just as having the radio on never meant you couldn\u0027t talk with a friend. That\u0027s the good news. Now the rest.CommentsNapoleon PerdisMakeup artistEvery girl can benefit from a pared-back approach to makeup during the summer months. It can be difficult to abandon your go-to makeup statement, so here are my tips for downsizing.CommentsRobert L. CavnarFounder, this-small-planet.com, dailyhurricane.com, and Gun Owners for Reform on FacebookBecause apparently this tragic shooting did not involve enough victims, the news media gave it ho-hum coverage, I guess because this kind of mass murder is just so everyday, these days.Comments (352)Victoria BrittainJournalist; Author, \u0027Shadow Lives: The Forgotten Women of the War on Terror\u0027A four-month hunger strike, mass force-feedings, and widespread media coverage have at last brought Guantanamo back into American consciousness. Still unnoticed and out of the news, however, is a comparable situation in the U.S. itself.Comments (60)SmarterTravelSmartertravel.comFor a traveler to breeze through any major airport, plenty of stars have to align. Security waits need to be short, terminals easy to navigate, intra-airport transportation abundant... Here\u0027s our list of the country\u0027s 10 speediest major airports.Comments (94)HuffPost RadioShow trials and screw-ups do not make for true \"scandals.\" But what about GOP efforts to in effect deny the original intent of Article II when it comes to Obama\u0027s constitutional power to name judges? Spitzer \u0026 Matalin debate this as well as the NSA and Rice-Power appointments.CommentsChris StedmanAuthor of \u0027Faitheist\u0027, Humanist Chaplain, Atheist and Interfaith ActivistAtheists are already in the minority in most parts of the country, constituting a small fraction of the religiously unaffiliated in the U.S., but it seemed I was to be an especially odd one out at this event. Or, as my mother once said: \"It\u0027s kind of hip to be a gay atheist [in Cambridge]. Not so much most everywhere else.\"Comments (138)Jen HatmakerSpeaker and authorWe are limping, limping across the finish line, folks.

Danois, J.D.Attorney, family law mediator and divorce coachWhile there are many right reasons we marry the right person, there are also many wrong reasons we marry the wrong one. Before you say, \"Yes,\" consider the following top five wrong reasons we decide to marry the wrong person, ultimately resulting in divorce.Comments (84)Robert L. Lynch and Robert RedfordThe arts can serve as both a model and catalyst for change for a number of the pressing societal challenges which face our nation. But it will require new ways of thinking and engaging with the opportunities and challenges of a more diverse, technologically-driven and entrepreneurial world.CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerWith each Game of Thrones episode we struggle with whom to invest our emotions so that we\u0027re not left with that aching numbness in the pit of our collective stomachs when a favorite character dies.
