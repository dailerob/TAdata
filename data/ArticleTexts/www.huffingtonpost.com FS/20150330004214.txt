{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This was a week of both progress and regression. First, Sen. Ted Cruz kicked off his presidential campaign and wasted no time showing what kind of candidate he\u0027ll be by claiming that, in the wake of 9/11, he stopped listening to rock and switched to country music. Finding a way, 14 years later, to use 9/11 to pander and divide is as impressive as it is cynical. Next, Indiana Governor Mike Pence found an even older way to divide, signing into law a bill that would, essentially, legalize anti-gay discrimination. On the other side of the progress/regression ledger, the five-year anniversary of Obamacare saw the percentage of uninsured adults fall to 12.9 percent. And, in case you missed it (though your daughter might not have), One Direction member Zayn Malik announced his retirement from the mega-group, citing his desire to relax. When even a One Direction member can choose to go in another direction, it\u0027s a reminder that we can all break with the past for a happier, healthier future.Once more, we must courageously embrace Nonviolence 365, which is based on my father\u0027s nonviolent philosophy and methodology, as the answer to the \"crucial political and moral questions of our time,\" and not as a mere response to incidents but as a lifestyle and a force for good that permeates our culture, including our media and entertainment.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterMulticulturalism should not mean that we tolerate another culture\u0027s intolerance. If we do in fact support diversity, women\u0027s rights, and gay rights, then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on that spurious ground.Author, Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation NowIt seems clear that Texas cannot constitutionally forbid the display of the Confederate flag on a license plate because others might find it \"offensive or disagreeable.\" But it is not so simple. Is the government discriminating among private speakers, or is it expressing only the messages it wishes to convey?Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWhenever we find ourselves in a stop-the-world-I-want-to-get-off mindset, we can remember that there is another way and open ourselves to grace. And it often starts with taking a moment to be grateful for this day, for being alive -- for anything. That\u0027s why I\u0027m delighted to announce HuffPost Gratitude.The \"Grow Your Value\" bonus competition drives home the message that it is important for women to both learn their value and communicate it effectively.Co-host, MSNBC’s \u0027Morning Joe\u0027Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) is now apparently undecided how he\u0027ll buy insurance, backing away from his Obamacare announcement earlier in the week.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Under New York\u0027s juvenile justice system a child as young as 7 can be arrested for a crime, and a 16-year-old is automatically charged as an adult. These laws are shockingly behind the times -- bad for children and bad for public safety.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundShould you ever find yourself in the unique situation of being out on a golf course alongside some big time CEOs of major corporations, here\u0027s a fun experiment to try. It\u0027s very simple -- just ask the CEOs for their opinion on welfare.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorLAHORE, Pakistan -- I write from a country where people like you and I live with our families -- loving grandparents, self-sacrificing parents with babies, innocent children and know-it-all teenagers. Where we search for tools of peace-building to heal our fractured but shared world.Executive Director, Centre for Dialogue and Action, Forman Christian College, PakistanRobertson\u0027s words are ugly and ignorant, and the organizers, and all those who applauded him at the Prayer Breakfast in Vero Beach should be ashamed of themselves.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe current dollar episode is a reminder that currency values matter and while manipulation is not in play this time, it could be so again in the future. If the TPP is as important as its advocates say it is, I can think of no better time and place to take preventive action against those who manage their currencies to our disadvantage.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe wealthier you are and the more you care about yourself over your neighbor or your country, the more you\u0027ll like this Republican budget. It achieves balance entirely on the backs of middle-class families and our most vulnerable citizens, without asking billionaires or big corporations to pay -- forget a fair share -- one penny more toward our nation\u0027s prosperity.Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandBy establishing nutrition guidelines for Americans that make healthy choices more accessible and affordable, policymakers have a real opportunity to improve the well being of millions of individuals. It\u0027s time to promote a culture of health in our nation.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralIn the twilight of the Obama presidency, it will be easy for Congress to throw up their hands and turn to 2016. This would be a terrible mistake. Responsible lawmakers have the opportunity to build a new nonpartisan coalition that is capable of solving problems.Fmr. Governor of Utah and National Chairman for No LabelsFmr. U.S. Senator from Connecticut and National Chairman for No LabelsThe undeserved \"lazy\" stigma given to night owls comes about due to the early birds of the world never seeing you at your most productive because, ironically, they\u0027re often fast asleep by the time you get going.WriterIn our everyday fights to silence the racist chants of misguided college students and stifle overaggressive police who racially profile black children, we must reach the finish line. The next generation should never have to question whether their lives matter.President and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)The feeling that everything can be accelerated has made some within Cuba reevaluate the price per square foot of their homes, others predict where the first Apple Store will open in Havana, and not a few begin to glimpse the silhouette of a ferry linking the island with Florida.Award-winning Cuban bloggerYou would be amazed at how many simple \"facts\" a family has passed down through stories repeated at the dinner table and family gatherings turn out not to be exact in their details, having become elaborated on over time, like a game of \"Telephone\" that we all played as children.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityEditor, writer, and teacherProstitution as portrayed in Pretty Woman is just about as far as you can get from the truth. Prostitution is ugly. Most of it is sex trafficking. It\u0027s intriguing to read that the movie\u0027s script originally was written as a dark, cautionary tale. That, from my perspective as a survivor, gets at the sad reality.Project manager for women’s justice programs and human-trafficking coordinator, Cook County Sheriff’s OfficeIt feels like Hollywood is finally starting to get what so many of us knew all along; audiences want to see diversity. Yet somehow, at this exciting moment of progress for the industry, Deadline Hollywood found it appropriate to publish what can only be described as a call for regression.Executive Director, ColorOfChangeI spoke with my friend. I asked outright: What should someone do for a loved one who is suffering? What helps? Together we discussed her feelings. Her perspective. Her pain. And then we worked on some bearings that really helped me be a better friend. Today I\u0027d like to share those with you.Freelance Writer, MotherThe world needs to put the brakes on climate change. But any plan to tackle climate change can\u0027t sacrifice economic growth if we hope to end extreme poverty, reduce inequality, and ensure that poor people gain access to energy. We need to decouple growth from carbon emissions. Here are five ways the world can shift to a low-carbon growth path.President, World Bank GroupFlight attendants take on a crucial role after any airline incident, and in the wake of the latest Germanwings tragedy, it is no different.Flight attendant \u0026 founder of TheFlyingPinto.comWhile much has been made about the so-called \"treasonous\" actions of 47 members of Congress, led by Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, in penning an ill-advised letter to the Government of Iran aimed at undermining the ongoing nuclear negotiations, there is a stark difference between political stupidity -- which the act of writing such a letter represents -- and espionage, which is what those members of Congress who have aided and abetted the Government of Israel in its efforts to collect and disseminate classified U.S. information to unauthorized persons have engaged in.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Small gestures like holding hands or putting your arm around each other increases closeness, which is always a factor in the lives of happy couples. When you hold hands, you\u0027re subconsciously reminding yourself that you care about each other.Matchmaker, dating expert, relationship advisorYou might be thinking, \"Amelia, this isn\u0027t going to go anywhere. It\u0027s California! It\u0027s not like it\u0027s going to become law.\" And you are right. But it doesn\u0027t take away from the fact that there are thousands of people in this country just like Mr. McLaughlin, who think a bullet in his head is exactly what my son deserves.Mother, wife, breadwinnerIt occurred to us at VoteVets.org that there will be a lot of statements from conservative candidates for president that range from \"fudged\" to \"completely wrong.\" Most of these statements are easy to predict. So, as a public service, here\u0027s a cheat sheet for you, so when you hear those statements, you know why they\u0027re just not right.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranI\u0027m surrounded by baby bumps and adorable, fat, juicy babies. I don\u0027t want any more babies... mentally. Logically, I know that I\u0027m not cut out to do this all over again. But sometimes my baby fever needs a nice, cold bucket of ice water thrown on it.Writer at piganddac.comWe must make this country a nation of equal protection under the law with equal opportunity for everyone. If we truly would like to be post-racial one day, we cannot continue to live in denial, or turn a blind eye towards reality, or remain complacent today. It\u0027s as simple as that.President, National Action NetworkWhile no divorce is without challenges, getting through it shows your child how to work through hard times to achieve a brighter future.Divorce expert, cookbook author, travel expertGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"MR.
