Not for Barack Obama -- after all, only three weeks ago he was 12 points behind. No, the biggest losers of the night were the pollsters, who will now have to down a heaping helping of humble pie. Like Lucy Ricardo, they have a lot of \u0027splainin\u0027 to do. This was obviously a great night for Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Bill. But also a very good night for the long-term prospects of Obama. The voters clearly want the nominee they pick to have fought for it. And now Obama has a chance to prove to the skeptics his mettle under fire.Read Post | CommentsBIOErica Jong, 01.09.2008Why is it okay for men to get misty and not for women? Why is it assumed everything HRC does is scripted?

Nobody should ever underestimate the Clinton machine again.Read Post | CommentsBIOPaul Begala, 01.09.2008After I told Fox yesterday that the story about me wasn\u0027t true -- and this is the surreal part -- they kept reporting it anyway. Fox\u0027s Garrett told me he\u0027d \"take it under advisement.\" Take it under advisement?Read Post | Comments (48)BIOBrian Williams, 01.09.2008Had Bill Clinton not famously coined the title \"The Comeback Kid\" for himself, his wife would have rightfully claimed it for herself in New Hampshire. That the same State rewarded these two imperfect politicians, in the same way, years apart, is remarkable.Read Post | Comments (36)BIOMarty Kaplan, 01.08.2008No matter what you think about Hillary Clinton, no matter how this campaign turns out, there is undeniable satisfaction in watching the pundit class being forced to eat the words of its premature obituaries.Read Post | Comments (219)BIOAllison Kilkenny, 01.09.2008If we can get to Obama before the special interest groups, if we can keep him from being perverted by the sickness in D.C., there still yet may be hope to save the country. And if not, at least you can tell your grandkids that you voted for a black guy.Read Post | CommentsBIOLee Woodruff, 01.08.2008The reaction to Hillary\u0027s moment of \"welling up\" is offensive to me; only one step above concerns over how a White House would function with a leader who gets PMS.Read Post | Comments (145)BIOJohn Neffinger, 01.09.2008Hillary, who has spent her entire public career stoically projecting strength so she could compete in the big leagues, finally showed us the warm, genuine person underneath. It would be wise for Obama to take note.Read Post | Comments (24)BIOVicki Iovine, 01.09.2008I firmly believe Hillary Clinton can make it all the way to Super Tuesday and back without asking for so much as a backrub. She\u0027s as tough and any guy in the race. So why did Hillary cry?Read Post | CommentsBIODavid Kuo, 01.08.2008It now seems pretty clear that virtually all of the late polling on the Democratic side was wrong -- very wrong. It is a return to the race-gap polling problems of the 1980s and \u002790s.Read Post | Comments (186)BIOMichael Shaw, 01.07.2008We may have seen that Chelsea, rather than Bill, has become the campaign\u0027s new inspiration (not to mention, its co-star).Read Post | Comments (30)Derek Shearer, 01.09.2008Chris Durang, 01.08.2008John Zogby, 01.09.2008Harry Shearer, 01.09.2008Kathleen Reardon, 01.09.2008Joseph A.
