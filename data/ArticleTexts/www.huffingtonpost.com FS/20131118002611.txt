{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, people continued to ask: is this the health insurance change we\u0027ve been waiting for? Having had nearly four years to prepare, the Obama administration continued to deal with the embarrassing, high-glitch, low-enrollment rollout of Obamacare. On Thursday, the president announced a feeble fix, allowing people to keep existing plans for a year, and admitted, about his \"you can keep it\" promise: \"that\u0027s on me... we fumbled the rollout.\" Trying to pounce on the fumble was the GOP-led House, which on Friday passed its own \"fix\" -- one that would essentially kneecap the law. Of course, it is the shockingly inept rollout that makes the Affordable Care Act vulnerable to such bogus \"reforms.\" The mystery is why Obamacare wasn\u0027t entrusted to the same tech wizards responsible for the state-of-the-art Obamacampaign. Odds are you won\u0027t hear the president rallying the nation around \"the fierce urgency of a fully functioning website by the end of the month,\" but that\u0027s the make-or-break moment the White House is now facing. Hope, indeed.Comments (173)Alec BaldwinActorTwo requests. Don\u0027t allow my problem to be MSNBC\u0027s problem. They are good people who work hard at a job, just like many of you. And two, please respect the privacy of my wife and family. If you have an opinion of me, then express it. But I ask that my wife, who I care about more than words can say, and both my children, be left out of this.Comments (1,218)Melinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationThis week, I\u0027m on a trip with two important stops: the Glamour Women of the Year Awards in New York City, then the International Family Planning Conference in Ethiopia. I can appreciate how this ensemble might appear to clash -- the red carpet next to the green-brown fields dotting a country that\u0027s 80 percent rural. But sometimes juxtaposing seemingly incongruous things can reveal an underlying truth.Comments (165)Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business and Global News Editor, The Huffington PostJPMorgan Chase stands accused of essentially funneling funds to Wen Jiabao\u0027s only daughter to win business in China, bringing a federal probe. Yet the takeaway here merely reinforces a truth that has long been evident to those paying attention to the pungent interplay of money and power in China: Despite the prattling of global business leaders that their presence in China is a wholesome boon to justice and right, they have frequently enriched themselves by engaging in the very dirty doings they claim to disdain.Comments (189)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIt\u0027s time to start thinking seriously about how a woman will manage the world\u0027s most powerful office. It\u0027s going to be a fascinating addition to the ongoing debate over the differences between male and female leadership styles -- including whether those differences even exist.Comments (403)John KerryU.S. Secretary of StateOur governments and citizens cannot afford to stand idle while poachers and wildlife traffickers destabilize whole regions, undermine economic development, and hunt elephants, rhinos, tigers, bears, sharks, or any species to extinction.Comments (218)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Why is there such strident opposition when the vast majority of the country is now in favor of immigration reform? When I asked a Republican senator this question, he was surprisingly honest: \"Fear,\" he said. Fear of an American future that looks different from the present.Comments (206)Laura SteppPulitzer Prize-winning journalistIs it too much to hope that one day, using birth control will be like getting a flu shot or taking your vitamins? Something any woman can afford -- and just does?Comments (426)Bianca JaggerFounder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationI appeal to President Xi Jinping to commit to progressing the recommendations made by UN member states on Tibet. He should immediately agree on dates for a visit from Navi Pillay, so that she may investigate the Tibetan grievances which have contributed to the tragic wave of self-immolations over the last two years.Comments (19)Mark Penn and Don BaerGiven the state of our economy today, we may not have the luxury of a moonshot like the GI Bill or the invention of the Internet to restore Americans\u0027 faith in opportunity. But we must do something, because our young people are internalizing the melancholy as the new normal.Comments (103)Sen. Jay RockefellerU.S. Senator, West VirginiaDespite legal protections, members of the military are still ripe targets for abusive financial practices. Many soldiers are young and inexperienced with their finances, and living on a military base in foreign country makes it difficult to shop for the insurance rates.Comments (12)Belle Beth CooperContent crafter, BufferI would love to be happier, as I\u0027m sure most people would, so I thought it would be interesting to find some ways to become a happier person that are actually backed up by science. Here are ten of the best ones I found.Comments (160)Benjamin Todd JealousPresident and CEO, NAACPIn a democracy, the people can win every time -- but only if we are organized. Today, when I reflect back on my half-decade at the helm of the NAACP, I am deeply proud of what we have accomplished together as we organized our communities.Comments (59)Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Rather than continuing to tell young people that they\u0027re needed to make the Affordable Care Act work, why not start telling them that their health matters, that denial has never been a cure, that there are lots of risks they\u0027ll take in their youth but not having health insurance is a risk that affects everyone who loves you and every dream you have.Comments (227)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activist\"Run your own race, baby.\"Those were the words spoken to me by father at a critical moment of my life. I was a struggling actress, just beginning her career, and I\u0027d gone to Dad in tears. He was a famous nightclub performer by then, and that was the problem: I couldn\u0027t get out from under his shadow.Comments (29)Terrell ThomasCornerback, New York GiantsThere\u0027s no better feeling than winning with a group of men that you consider to be your brothers, who will take time out of their busy schedules so that we can bond and keep gelling to make this run. One day, one week, one game at a time...CommentsEcumenical Patriarch BartholomewSpiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwideTo restore the planet we need a spiritual worldview, which brings frugality and simplicity, humility and respect. We must be aware of the impact of our actions on all of creation.Comments (169)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhen a majority of all American fourth and eighth grade public school students can\u0027t read or do math at grade level, including almost three quarters of Black and Latino students, we are continuing to allow a system that serves and saves just a few children and starves many others.Comments (65)Dana GoodyearStaff writer for the New YorkerWhat is edible? In the most practical sense, edible is what the government says we can eat. But there is a growing movement--of renegade chefs, fearless eaters, and imaginative provisioners--who are seeking to enlarge the strict American diet of chicken-beef-pork and corn-based everything.Comments (117)Maureen Dawn HealyAuthor, speaker and parenthood expertGot some chutzpah? Or some stubborn determination to succeed when the chips are down? Is this what Angela Lee Duckworth is referring to when she says grit?CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe passage of Prop 103 was a monumental accomplishment and an example of what can happen when people band together for a cause and show up at the polls. Hopelessness is merely a sentiment for the apathetic.Comments (38)Karyn ThurstonFull-time mama and writer, www.girlofcardigan.comThese are the words I wish I\u0027d read before jumping headlong into the mommyhood with my books and my charts and my ideals and my high horses. They\u0027re flawed, and they aren\u0027t all pretty, but they\u0027re hard-won and honest and as true as I can get \u0027em.Comments (46)Christella MorrisMother; Blogger, crawltheline.comWhat if nobody gave my boys presents anymore? What if we only gave GIFTS.Comments (62)AmeliaMother, wife, partner and breadwinnerMy middle son was tired, so he was nestled against my chest as I floated on my back. \"Mom,\" he said, breaking the silence, \"I want to be gay.\" This was unexpected. My middle son had never had boy crushes like my older kid, and last year he wanted to marry a female classmate.Comments (460)Micah J. MurrayBlogger at RedemptionPictures.comBecause of feminism, church stages and spotlights are often dominated by women. Men are encouraged to just serve in the nursery or kitchen. Sometimes men are even told to stay silent in church.Comments (901)Brenda Della CasaAuthor, \"Cinderella Was a Liar\"; Owner \u0026 Editor-In-Chief: Staggered Magazine, Editor-In-Chief, Preston Bailey Designs; Founder \u0026 Editor-In-Chief: Life In Style www.bdclifeinstyle.comI am one of those \"welfare\" people so many people callously group into the \"lazy\" section of the room. While I am often told by these same people that I am one of the hardest working people they know, the reality is that there is no way I would be where I am today without the help I received in my past.Comments (653)Sharon GreenthalBlogger, Empty House Full Mind, Founder, midlifeboulevard.comIf you read blogs or go on Facebook or even watch the news, you\u0027ve probably heard about the post written by Seth Adam Smith -- Marriage Isn\u0027t For You. In the post, Mr. Smith writes thoughtfully and sincerely about his brief (1 1/2-year) marriage and the advice his father gave him about what marriage is for.Comments (185)Tony PosnanskiBlogger, \u0027The Anti-Jared\u0027I thought about how unfair women\u0027s sizes are to men\u0027s sizes. I do not wear anything that is considered a large. No one makes comments about my size anymore. I have not ripped or gone through a pair of pants in years. Yet if I was a women I would have to shop at \"plus-size\" stores.Comments (247)Andy BellattiRegistered dietitian; Creator of Small Bites\"Cap the Tap\" is a perfect example of the doublespeak that Big Food and Big Soda often employ. The carefully calculated veneer of wanting to be \"part of the solution\" and \"offering choices\" to consumers is negated by efforts like this one, which basically paints tap water as an enemy.Comments (241)Ellen SeidmanBlogger, Love That MaxHolly is a beautiful girl who happens to have CP. End of story. A great beginning for Holly!Comments (35)Thomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborFor this administration, raising the minimum wage is just one part of what the president has called the \"unfinished business\" of America.Comments (19)Renee Fisher, 2013.17.11Robert Reich, 2013.17.11Michelle Kelly-Irving, 2013.17.11Keith Runyon, 2013.17.11Ben Teller, 2013.17.11Suzette Standring, 2013.17.11Michelle Chen, 2013.17.11Christina Gagnier, 2013.17.11Christa Zambardino, 2013.17.11H.A.
