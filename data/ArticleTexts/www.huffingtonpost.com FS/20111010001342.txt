{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, \"outs\" were in. In politics, Chris Christie and Sarah Palin announced they were officially out of the running for 2012. In Italy, Amanda Knox was finally out of prison after an appeals court jury overturned her conviction for murdering her roommate. Knox quickly flew home to Seattle amid rampant speculation about how much money she could make for selling her story. Also out: Hank Williams, Jr., whose signature intro song will no longer be a part of Monday Night Football. The country singer had told Fox News that the president hitting the links with John Boehner was \"like Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu.\" (Note to rhetorical extremists on both sides: Nazi comparisons never help make your case.) Tragically, this week also saw the way-before-his-time passing of Steve Jobs, a towering example of an American businessman whose vision, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit benefited both Apple and the world. Take note, Wall Street. RIP, Steve.Read Post | Comments (41)Bill Maher, 10/3/11Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"The thing about your fifties is, you\u0027re not nearly over -- in fact, lots of ambitious people are peaking -- but it is the first time in your life that you can see over the crest of the mountain and down into the Valley below -- you know, Death.Read Post | Comments (1,212)Diana Nyad, 10/6/11Long distance swimmerSteve Jobs will be associated forever with the cultural icons who stepped outside the establishment.
