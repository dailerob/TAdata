{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/U.S. Army, Spc. Joshua M. ReisnerFrom barnesandnoble.comGeorge Bush is back in flight suit mode, exuding the macho, Protector-in-Chief swagger that got him re-elected. While passing out Purple Hearts at an Army hospital in Texas, the president strongly defended the NSA spy program as a key tool in fending off another terrorist attack. So far, the public seems to be buying this Colonel Jessep Defense (\"You need me on that wall!\"), with half of the country saying the warrantless domestic wiretapping had made America safer. But I\u0027m confidently predicting that Bush\u0027s bluster will soon give way to a far less full-throated stance. Why? Because we\u0027ve seen this pattern before. It\u0027s the Bush administration\u0027s political spin on those five stages of grief, which move from denial to anger, through bargaining and depression to, finally, acceptance.READ POST | comments (71)01.02.2006 Sherman YellenAs a playwright, I find a problem with Bush as a dramatic character in a serious drama. Although he is perfectly suited for satire, he is now caught up in a tragic national drama and it is as if Shakespeare\u0027s Bottom had stumbled into Hamlet by mistake and taken over the stage.READ POST | comments01.02.2006 Andrew Foster AltschulSome Thoughts for Howard Dean, Harry Reid, Bob Schrum, Donna Brazile, John Podesta, Nancy Pelosi, and the Rest of the Shit-for-Brains So-Called Leaders of the Democratic Party.READ POST | comments01.02.2006 Richard BradleyWatching NBC tonight, I\u0027ve just seen an impressive new low in journalistic integrity: an eight-minute ad for an NBC news show tucked jarringly into the middle of a program produced by the entertainment division.READ POST | comments01.03.2006 Jane HamsherMain stream media journalists do not spend hours and days sifting through raw data.
