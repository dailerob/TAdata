It clearly is for Chris Dodd, Patrick Leahy, and the other senators who vowed to vote no on the Mukasey nomination due to his refusal to say whether the controversial torture technique is illegal. But the AG designate\u0027s unwillingness was apparently not enough to dissuade Judiciary Committee members Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein, whose support virtually guarantees Mukasey\u0027s confirmation. In announcing her decision, DiFi delivered the week\u0027s lamest endorsement. \"First and foremost,\" she said, \"Michael Mukasey is not Alberto Gonzales.\" Wow, with credentials like that, how could you not make him America\u0027s top cop? Bush defended Mukasey\u0027s waterboard waffling, saying \"he had not been briefed\" on the technique. Allow us: Kaj Larsen blogs about having himself waterboarded for Mukasey\u0027s edification.Read Post | Comments (108)BIOBill Maher, 11.01.2007New Rule: In the next fifteen months, President Bush has to perform at least one act that doesn\u0027t make money for someone he knows.Read Post | Comments (360)BIOMax Blumenthal, 10.29.2007If anything, the evangelical movement seemed more extreme and paranoid than it did four years ago.
