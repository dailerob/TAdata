{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorNow that the House has passed the Senate compromise bill, the full spate of tax increases and spending cuts that went into effect yesterday will be shut off (though the sequester was just suspended for a couple of months). Still, I don\u0027t mean to be a downer, but any relief you feel should be analogized to how much better you feel when you stop banging a hammer on your head. We\u0027ve avoided, for the moment, a self-made trap. Now, of course, we\u0027re on to the next one -- the debt ceiling. It is unthinkable that the nation should, in weeks, be put through another crazy fiscal debate, this one with even higher stakes. It is even more unthinkable to allow a group of renegades to force national default in order to get a dollar of spending cuts for each dollar increase in the ceiling. This isn\u0027t just a debt ceiling debate. It\u0027s a chance to shut down a dynamic wherein Congress doesn\u0027t solve economic problems, it creates them.Read Post | Comments (436)John Cusack, 01/01/13Makes filmsRecently, I sat down with George Washington Law School professor and constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley and my close friend Kevin McCabe to discuss WikiLeaks\u0027 impact on transparency, the government\u0027s response, and the comparison to the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg.Read Post | Comments (592)Robert Reich, 01/02/13Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The battle over the fiscal cliff was only a prelude to the coming battle over raising the debt ceiling -- a battle that will likely continue through early March, when the Treasury runs out of tricks to avoid a default on the nation\u0027s debt.Read Post | Comments (413)Janell Burley Hofmann, 12/28/12WriterFailure to comply with the following list will result in termination of your iPhone ownership.Read Post | Comments (1,306)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 01/02/13Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostYou see, whether the anti-gay movement and the biblical literalists of our country like it or not, Westboro Baptist Church has become their most visible and vocal mouthpiece.Read Post | Comments (418)Laura Doyle, 01/02/13Best-selling AuthorHere are five ways that women unwittingly sabotage their marriages, along with the proven remedies for restoring the love and closeness you once shared.Read Post | Comments (1,795)Doug Bandow, 01/02/13Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteLittle more than a postage stamp in the Persian Gulf, Kuwait was long overseen, or \"protected,\" by Great Britain, before becoming independent in 1961.
