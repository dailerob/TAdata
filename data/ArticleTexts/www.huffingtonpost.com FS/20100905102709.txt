{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought more depressing economic news, with the \"underemployment\" rate rising to 16.7 percent, and the White House considering a stimulus lite package of tax breaks. We need to keep pushing Washington to finally put bold and robust job creation front and center. But, in the meantime, we can\u0027t just sit on the sidelines. To coincide with the release of my new book, Third World America, I\u0027m going to be traveling around the country for the next few months, speaking about the practical steps we can all take to help each other through the hard times and strengthen our communities. And we are crowdsourcing part of the tour. Click here to find out where I\u0027m going to be speaking and how you can get your group, school, organization, or town on the schedule. Together, we can take action to rebuild the middle class and restore the American Dream.Read Post | CommentsSec.
