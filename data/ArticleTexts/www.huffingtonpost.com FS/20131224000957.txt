{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolThe latest announcement from the White House on Thursday, December 19, seems to indicate that even President Obama is backing away from Obamacare. At the very least, he is bobbing and weaving like an exhausted prize fighter trying to avoid a knockout punch. For the President, that punch would be a disastrous rollout of Obamacare that leaves Americans so angry that the Democrats lose their five-seat majority in the Senate in 2014. That could happen with the never-ending fallout from the new plans. Not surprisingly, the latest White House retreat just before the December 23rd enrollment deadline was triggered by pressure from moderate Senate Democrats like Mark Warner (D-VA) and Mary Landrieu (D-LA). Landrieu faces a tough 2014 election campaign.Comments (55)Trevor TimmExecutive Director, Freedom of the Press FoundationEvery American should be outraged that leakers and whistleblowers are being prosecuted under an espionage statute without ever having to show they meant to harm the U.S. or that any harm actually occurred.CommentsHeather SpohrWriter, philanthropist and blogger, The Spohrs Are MultiplyingIf you\u0027re anything like me, you\u0027re the type of person who wants to preserve family memories (and your record of family road trips) for posterity. And of course, if your family is anything like mine, you\u0027re also likely to find that easier said than done.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorHealth coverage is not cheap, because health care is not cheap. In the interest of sustainability, we have to implement some version of reform to squeeze inefficiencies out of the system. Some will pay more, though they will often get more coverage for their extra bucks. Many -- post subsidy -- will pay less.Comments (197)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersOver the last decade the far right, that now dominates the GOP, has conducted a real war on the values that we celebrate at Christmas.Comments (55)Jeffrey LaurentiInternational affairs analyst and commentatorIncomprehensibly, John Kerry was not on Time\u0027s short list. The U.S. secretary of state may not deal with cosmic truths, but by any secular standard Kerry has, in one short year, justifiably laid claim to the blessings the gospels promise to peacemakers.CommentsKaren PapernoOwner, Boing BoingMine has become a neighborhood of excess and ease while I have sunk into poverty. Here I am, the owner of a shop in the epicenter of the baby universe, and I can\u0027t make my rent. I just want people to know how some of us are hiding in plain sight, serving you with a smile while our gut lurches with hunger and anxiety.Comments (44)Jeffrey Bland, Ph.DPresident, Personalized Lifestyle Medicine InstituteI believe that the announcement by the FDA of the approval of the genome sequencing technology for medical applications is symbolic for the future development of personalized health care.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCelebrity weight loss stories are called out as destructive and anti-feminist. And yet, there\u0027s something refreshing -- and, perhaps, even healthy -- about those celebrities who publicly discuss their ups and downs.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It is possible to have principled arguments with political conservatives on a wide array of public issues, ranging from late-term abortions to privatizing Social Security. But there is no principled debate about suppressing the right to vote.Comments (27)Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostThe highest-paid state employee in Alabama just got another massive raise. And for that he can thank many of his own laborers, who make almost nothing.Comments (12)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgNumbers show just how big the disconnect is between the reality of what\u0027s occurred in health care since Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and the perception that people have of the law resulting from the relentless campaign of misinformation from the president\u0027s opponents.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureLocal politicians are taking on the big banks. Candidates for major office are adopting populist themes. But it starts at the bottom, not the top, with activists who engage with and crystallize the public\u0027s desire for justice.CommentsAndrey TolokonnikovFather of Pussy Riot Band MemberIt is a completely cynical game by the central government.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThere are more African Americans under correctional control today -- in prison or jail, on probation or parole -- than were enslaved in 1850, a decade before the Civil War began.CommentsGretchen WhitmerState Senator, MichiganI\u0027m one of only four women currently serving in the Michigan Senate and to say there\u0027s an \"old boys club\" mentality in our Capitol Building would be putting it mildly.

Here are seven last-minute gifts that don\u0027t look like afterthoughts -- and all can be found at your local mall.Comments (12)Kathy EldonFounder and President, Creative Visions FoundationI knew I could never forgive the Somalis who killed my son. My journey to forgiveness was long and painful, but one incident was to change forever the trajectory of my life.CommentsDebbie FinkBlogger, Marketing executiveThere needs to be more support for women like me: relatively young, childless not by choice and facing cancer or some other life-impacting disease; women like me who ache every time they see a stroller or hear the delicious laugh of an infant.CommentsChristopher CrossRecording Artist, Five-Time Grammy WinnerI think the way Yacht Rock has grown, garnering fans across the world and even celebrity fans like my buddy, Jimmy Fallon, is proof the that the sound Hall \u0026 Oates played such a big part in creating is truly a page in Rock and Roll lore.CommentsRebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s coming. I do know that, whatever it is, some of it will be terrible, but some of it will be miraculous, that term we reserve for the utterly unanticipated, the seeds we didn\u0027t know the soil held. And I know that we don\u0027t know what we do does.CommentsConde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comWe are going to hell for thinking these photos are so funny.CommentsMark RippetoePowerlifter; Coach; Author, \u0027Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training\u0027One of the most persistent myths in the entire panoply of conventional exercise wisdom is that squats below parallel are somehow bad for the knees. Better-informed professionals know better. Here are four reasons why.CommentsFrances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilThe United States broke one record after another for extreme weather in 2013. Americans saw what unchecked climate change can do to our communities. But we also witnessed another kind of powerful force: real and positive climate action.CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027The New York Times is hardly a progressive newspaper -- but when it comes to the surveillance state and ongoing militarism of the Obama White House, the establishment\u0027s \"paper of record\" puts MoveOn.org to shame.CommentsLes LeopoldAuthor, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)All of us have spent a great deal of time complaining about Wall Street and how hard it is to take them on given all their money and political power. But here we have several cities with more in the wings actually doing something about it. Wouldn\u0027t it be something if progressives all over the country spread this campaign to their own town councils?CommentsMimi Schippers, Ph.D.Associate Professor of Sociology, Tulane UniversityWhile all eyes and pointing fingers are on the poor, rural, white, Southern bigot, we fail to see the owners of media corporations sitting comfortably in their mansions making decisions about which hilarious down-trodden stereotype to trot out next.Comments (79)Krystie YandoliWriterI love my Grandmere, and I love that she wants me to find happiness -- believe it or not, I\u0027d love to find authentic happiness too -- but the reality is, I\u0027m still evolving as a human being.Comments (28)Zach J. HoagAuthor \u0026 Freelance MinisterThe progressive Christian attempt to counter the conservative perspective, while needed, may also be missing the root issue involved. Christianity is alive and well in the Duck Dynasty, and the root issue is a posture of arrogance and power instead of kingdom humility and healing.Comments (46)Carl SicilianoExecutive Director, Ali Forney CenterI have been talking with homeless kids from all over the country, asking them to help us understand what it means to be left on the streets, asking them to give witness to what they endure. I ask you to look into their traumatized eyes and listen with me to their heartbreaking testimonies.Comments (24)Robert J. ElisbergScreenwriter and columnistWhat the film is about is not making jokes about two old farts getting back into the ring. That misses the point.
