{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Charles DharapakAPWith Plamegate dominating the day, the table is set for the Democratic Party to seize the moment. So how have the Democrats reacted? You be the grand jury (Warning: have some Xanax or other suitable anti-depressant handy): Exhibit A is the story NPR ran on Tuesday in which Senate Dems were asked if they regretted their votes to authorize the war in Iraq. Hillary Clinton refused to even address the question, saying: “I really can’t talk about this on the fly, it’s too important”. As with everything Hillary says and does these days, you could hear her and her consultants doing the math: Expressing regret \u003d too soft for the Oval Office...

Shmocuments. The idea that her withdrawal is a consequence of an intransigent Senate\u0027s insistence on breaching executive privilege is being roundly poo-poohed as a \"red herring.\"READ POST | comments (39)10.27.2005 Robert SchlesingerMiers\u0027 withdrawal clears the way for a rapprochement between Bush and his party\u0027s base. If Bush nominates someone from the conservative judicial farm system, a Michael Luttig or Edith Brown Clement, it would be the political equivalent of make-up sex.READ POST | comments (14)10.27.2005 David WallechinskyNovak exposed not only Valerie Plame, but any other CIA agent who ever used that fake company as his or her cover. Any other covert agents who worked with Plame lost their covers as well.READ POST | comments (29)10.27.2005 Cenk UygurThe Vice President of the United States is actively lobbying for torture right now. And the sick thing is -- he has an excellent chance of winning.READ POST | comments (46)10.27.2005 Kathleen ReardonIf there had never been a Valerie Plame, would there have been the level of criminal politics being investigated by Patrick Fitzgerald?
