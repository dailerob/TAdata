{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From nytimes.com/Joao SilvaIt’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas (circa 2005): fingers being pointed, values being questioned, ugly epithets being displayed like ornaments on a tree. It\u0027s Ho, ho, hopeless. Don’t miss Bob Cesca, Eric Schmeltzer, Eric Boehlert, Nina Burleigh, and Larisa Alexandrovna taking on the war on Christmas. Then check out some of the best of the rest of this week’s posts in our roundup below. Plus, our “Eat the Press” watchdogs Harry Shearer and Michelle Pilecki taking a bite out of the media, Dalton Conley on a “Man’s Right to Choose”, and Jonathan Tasini on why he’s running against Hillary.READ POST12.07.2005 Nora EphronHillary and Condi are starting to blur together in my brain.

Kennedy Jr.The Attorney General\u0027s demurral on what constitutes torture opens up a loophole large enough for Torquemada to ride through on a wagonload of Iron Maidens, breaking wheels and thumbscrews.READ POST | comments (70)12.08.2005 Stephen Gaghan\u0027Inducement.\u0027 It’s against the law in America.

Donald Wildmon and the Dobson guy revealed to everyone that they have the same homosexual agenda as I do.READ POST | comments (43)12.06.2005 Max ClelandThe angry rhetoric on Fox News Monday night seemed all too familiar.

Repeat after me: YOU ARE NOT A SCIENCE PROJECT. You are a car. With a 50-kilowatt electric motor.READ POST | comments (29)12.09.2005 Anthony LewisHow can it be that hundreds of Americans have been involved in the tormenting of prisoners? The answer is that the cue for these outrages came from the top of the American government.READ POST | comments (25)12.06.2005 Marty KaplanSet aside, for now, the incompatibility between Christian gospel and the Wildmon doctrine of hating your neighbor. Instead, look at how this story is moving through the media.READ POST | comments (93)12.08.2005 Daniel SchorrIn an NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll, only 24 percent of respondents say Republicans represent their priorities -- but only 26 percent favor the Democrats.READ POST | comments (43)12.09.2005 Justin FrankGeorge Bush, by all counts, is an untreated alcoholic.

To say that terrorists will be goaded by peace has no historical precedent. Terrorists are goaded by repression and aggression.READ POST | comments (51)12.09.2005 Hooman MajdThe only danger that any Iranian threats could become a reality is if the top of the leadership in Tehran changes.
