He rightly says China is killing us on trade and wrongly says that immigrants are taking people\u0027s jobs, but people believe it and people listen.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureFeminism\u0027s links with reproductive freedom go deeper. It means treating women as human beings rather than baby-making machines. It\u0027s recognition that women have talents and skills to offer the world beyond their ability to procreate.
