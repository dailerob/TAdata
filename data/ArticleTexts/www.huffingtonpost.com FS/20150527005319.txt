{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, historian, authorThe fact that Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio can say with a straight face that W. and Cheney and Rummy and Condi were innocent dupes of an \"intelligence failure,\" and that the corporate media will blandly repeat these lies, points to a deep failure in our political discourse. There was no sectarian war going on in Iraq until the U.S. invasion and occupation created the social, economic, and political conditions for it. There was no Al Qaeda in Iraq until the U.S. invaded and sparked an insurgency. While people in Iraq suffer as a result of misguided and criminal U.S. policies, the American people, facing a $5 billion election in 2016, are hearing presidential candidates put forth the most pathetic apologetics, spin, and lies as they try to whitewash the whole thing.We have to demand an end to corporate welfare. No more handouts to particular corporations and industries simply because they\u0027re big enough and powerful enough to get them. No more specialized tax breaks. No more exemptions or special treatment. No more crony capitalism.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Spain is entering into a new time and a new political culture with minority and coalition governments, far from the bipartisanship that for 40 years has favored a predictable alternation between conservatives and social democrats since Franco\u0027s death.Editorial Director, El Huffington PostCleaning up the oil spilling into the ocean by Santa Barbara will cost much more than preventing the leak would have cost. But of course, preventing the leak would require more \"overreaching by government\" and \"job-killing regulations.\" We pay for this ideological idiocy.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteThere may have been more than 100 bikers at Twin Peaks, all of whom believed they were \u0027good guys\u0027 who needed to carry guns in case a \u0027bad guy\u0027 from another gang was also armed.Mike the Gun GuyFor the last quarter of a century, NAN and I have advocated on behalf of many victims of racial violence at the hands of police. But in all those years, I\u0027ve never seen a situation that will force a national election to deal with policing as I do now. Translation: GOP candidates will actually have to deal with policing as an issue.President, National Action NetworkBecause of my recent trip to Africa, I now understand how the Clinton family continues to serve. I had the privilege to travel to five initiatives of the Clinton Foundation in Africa. On the trip, I saw first-hand the quiet appreciation on the faces of President and Chelsea Clinton when they observed the real-life results of their work.CEO of EL RothschildThere is no single policy that would have anywhere near as much impact in reforming the financial sector. A FTT would effectively impose a sales tax on stocks and other financial assets, so that speculators have to pay a tax on their trades, just like people who buy shoes or clothes. There are three points people should understand about a FTT.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Boys will break your heart, and you will break theirs, and it will probably happen again and again. But I will be here every single time to talk you through it. Promise.Writer, Mom and All Around Awesome PersonAccording to experts, approximately one-third of the world\u0027s remaining oil and natural gas reserves are to be found in the Arctic. There needs to be a balance between protecting the Arctic environment and the need for resource development and management. The joint pursuit of responsible Arctic stewardship is necessary.Ambassador of Norway to the United StatesAmbassador of Iceland to the United StatesAmbassador of Finland to the United StatesAmbassador of Sweden to the United StatesAmbassador of Denmark to the United StatesWith these four new trump cards on the table, the odds against fast-track get better -- and almost certainly the next Presidential election will put the candidates of both parties to the test. Trade diplomacy\u0027s House of Cards looks ever shakier -- even if it doesn\u0027t topple in the next few months.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubThere may be some differences in style and emphasis, but it\u0027s hard to tell the difference between a Clinton speech and a Warren speech when it comes to most economic questions -- and particularly when it comes to the overarching narrative.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIf the voices and concerns of ordinary Americans aren\u0027t at the center of this debate, we can expect the ticking time bomb of urban unrest to explode in more and more communities. Without major reforms, the recent upheavals in Ferguson and Baltimore may simply be a precursor to a wave of 21st century riots.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWhen you see students walk the stage at graduation this year, know that behind them is an invisible line of men and women who helped each one to buy hope for themselves and to bet on a future that needs their talent.2015 National Teacher of the Year, English teacher, literacy salespersonGoogle is a wonderful creation. However, despite Google\u0027s historic contribution to the world, the fact remains that many of the links it lists on its search pages are often partially or even completely false.Media Crisis Management ExpertRepublicans risk being caught in a trap of their own devising. The master narrative they\u0027re going with -- dishonesty -- is as dangerous for them as they want it to be for Hillary Clinton. They want the 2016 election to turn on the question \"Can you trust her?\" But Democrats can use jiu-jitsu and make the election turn on the question \"Can you trust the people who duped you into Iraq?\"USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorImagine an alternative universe in which the two major Cold War superpowers evolved into the United Soviet Socialist States. The conjoined entity, linked perhaps by a new Bering Straits land bridge, combines the optimal features of capitalism and collectivism.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogWill Mr. Huckabee\u0027s recognition that \"being a minor means that one\u0027s judgment is not mature\" lead him to oppose prosecuting juveniles as adults, housing them in adult jails and prisons, or sentencing them to mandatory prison sentences?Clinical law professor, Northwestern University School of LawIf you\u0027ve travelled in 2015, you know selfie sticks have replaced fanny packs and Tilley hats as the most sought-after tourist paraphernalia. While the device has many faults -- it disrupts the \"visitor experience\" in museums and at festivals and is pretty much the embodiment of narcissism -- the stick\u0027s most serious offence is that it turns users into anti-social tourists.Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaA month after Nepal\u0027s most devastating earthquake in 80 years, there are at least a few things to be optimistic about. But make no mistake: a nation that was trying to find itself after a long feudal slumber has now lost its footing again.Traveler, NGO guy and technology aficionadoI was surprised to learn that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in Shanghai and Seoul that Indian expatriates are ashamed to have been born in India. This doesn\u0027t reflect the reality. What Indians -- everywhere -- have been ashamed of is India\u0027s inept government.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurIf you can distinctly recall the excitement of walking into your weekly computer lab session and seeing a room full of Apple 2Es displaying the start screen of Oregon Trail, you\u0027re a member of this nameless generation, my friend.Director of Content \u0026 Social Media, WebRev Marketing \u0026 DesignJohn Nash was a legend. He simply looked at things differently. He taught me that even geniuses need other people to correct their thinking and vet their ideas. Most importantly, however, Nash taught me that anyone\u0027s mind can be beautiful if it focuses on producing beautiful ideas.CEO, Conquer RiskWhether you call it Valued-Added (VAM), Accountability, or Assessment, testing is not about learning. It is about sorting kids out, punishing teachers, schools, and communities, and denying deeper social inequality and injustice.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownThe Irish have made history over the weekend. Voting with an overwhelming majority to embrace gay marriage, they have leapfrogged a big part of Europe.Managing Director, Center for Transatlantic Relations (CTR), Johns Hopkins UniversityGasoline in California is one buck more per gallon than it is in the rest of America, thanks to low inventories and a series of suspicious oil-refinery shutdowns that drove huge first-quarter profits for the oil companies. Are California oil refiners manipulating gasoline supplies through shutdowns to drive pump prices and profits higher?Author, \u0027The Progressive\u0027s Guide to Raising Hell\u0027; President, Consumer WatchdogAs the field of presidential candidates grows, so does the absolute certainty with which they claim to understand what ails the nation and how to fix it.Founder, Leadership for a Responsible SocietyThe Hollywood depiction of aliens is a narrative shortcut. When diminutive, smooth-skinned, big-eyed creatures make their appearance on-screen, everyone knows where they call home. But how likely is it that any real aliens will resemble us as closely as the emblematic grays? Not very.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteHillary Clinton told supporters that if elected she will appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Citizens United, according to a Washington Post report. This is good news for our democracy -- but the Court\u0027s role in helping wealthy interests dominate politics goes far deeper than one bad case.Counsel and Senior Advisor, Policy \u0026 Outreach, DemosIt\u0027s not the product I find stupid. Nor the company that makes it. What is stupid is Twitter\u0027s insistence on ignoring their value as an engine of commerce and mindlessly following the lead of Google and Facebook as an engine of advertisement. Wake up, Twitter.Speaker, author, craft beer drinker and futuristIf you\u0027re not yet married -- and you\u0027re ambitious about your career endeavors -- a potential mate\u0027s conscientiousness may be worth considering.Psychotherapist and author of \u002713 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t Do\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
