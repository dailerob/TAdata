{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe chattering classes are focused on the so-called \"fiscal cliff,\" the automatic spending cuts and tax expirations scheduled to kick in after the elections.

God help me. It is heart-wrenching to spoon-feed your daughter poison that you know, at its optimum, will provide a few more weeks to her cruelly young life. But that is precisely what we did.Read Post | Comments (58)Mike Edwards and Danny Oppenheimer, 09/27/12The Electoral College is a cancerous tumor on American democracy.

Ed Markey, 09/27/12U.S. Representative, Seventh Congressional District of Massachusetts; Ranking Member, House Natural Resources CommitteeWhile powerful, the polluter playbook is no match for the truth and those brave enough to shout it from the rooftops. That is the lesson of Rachel Carson. Her courage inspired citizens to demand change, even as polluters tried to silence the author of Silent Spring.Read Post | Comments (23)Jack Healey, 09/26/12Founder, Human Rights Action CenterMost people think the people suffering in human rights situations are older people.
