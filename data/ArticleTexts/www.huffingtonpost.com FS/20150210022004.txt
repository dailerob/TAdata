{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityThe true State of the Union, and the state of the world, in 2015 can be described in one word: precarious. Despite our wealth, our technological knowhow, our global social media, we are a world at war with each other and with the planet itself. The real world is different from the imagined one of the mass media and the happy talk of too many politicians. President Barack Obama told us that the U.S. is back and that the union is strong. That is true if you are white and rich. That is true if you are a banker, the head of a for-profit hospital, or a military intelligence consultant. It is not true if you are incarcerated, crushed by a heavy student debt, or raising children as a single mother in Detroit, St. Louis, or Harlem.Since the end of the nineteenth century, the movement for a critical reflection on the foundations and interpretations of Islam has lost momentum, impeded by the predominance of a sclerotic, Arabo-centric Islam based on an obsolete worldview and often dismissive of non-Arab Muslims.President of the World Conference for Religions for PeaceFmr. Vice Prime Minister of Malaysia, head of the national opposition and chairman of the World Forum for Muslim DemocratsPeople think that Brian Williams is the problem because he exaggerated a war story about Iraq? Are you kidding me? The whole war was based on a monstrous lie that almost the entire media enabled and perpetuated. That\u0027s the real problem.Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027Much the same argument for the sharing economy was voiced in the late nineteenth century over alleged \"freedom of contract.\" Any deal between employees and workers was assumed to be fine if both sides voluntarily agreed to it. It was an era when many workers were \"happy\" to toil twelve-hour days in sweat shops for lack of any better alternative.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It didn\u0027t take long for the Guantanamo military commission in the 9/11 case to stumble again -- this time when two of the accused co-conspirators said they recognized a translator in the courtroom from their time in a CIA black site.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstMoussaoui\u0027s testimony makes that position even less sustainable. Mr. President, release the 28 pages. We can handle the truth.SiriusXM Radio HostSince a substantial minority of Republicans actually believe that the president is a Muslim, he can\u0027t be the one to challenge them on this issue. Muslim-baiting will not end until a Republican leader steps forward and takes on the likes of Jindal or Palin or Bachmann.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027For years people have been running around Washington yelling that the United States was at risk of becoming Greece. There may actually be a basis for such concerns, but not for the reason usually given.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Instead of staying laser-focused on the very real, very complex and very dangerous consequences of the outcome of the negotiations with Iran, the public discourse is now being hijacked by politics.National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueEver since Bruce Lee died, much of our self-confidence as Asian Americans has died along with him. Today, it feels like we have no Asian heritage to embrace. We no longer view martial arts or Eastern philosophy as our own. And most of us would feel uncomfortable embracing Bruce Lee\u0027s spiritual side.Editor, TypeZen.com: \u0027Going with the Flow in a Type A World\u0027The one-year increase in wages has been only 2.2 percent, barely more than 1 percent when adjusted for inflation, and it\u0027s been a long time since most workers have seen substantial raises. In this recovery, the economy has been creating more low-wage jobs than high-wage ones. The shift from standard payroll jobs to temp and contract work continues.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027We have become a profoundly unequal society. Unless we can build momentum for a new political agenda, we\u0027ll be divided into a small minority with fabulous wealth and a permanent underclass with few hopes or prospects. Unfortunately, our mainstream political dialogue shows no sign of adapting to these realities.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe IT revolution has us all entangled. Most of us are enraptured. The younger you are, the more likely to be in this latter category. It is like that with all dramatic social innovations. Habit is resistant to change; the older you are the more entrenched your habits.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe chief justice of Alabama\u0027s supreme court is making a stand in the courthouse door. This is not literally happening, the way it did in 1963 when Alabama Gov. George Wallace made a similar stand in the schoolhouse door. But in both cases, high Alabama officials are trying to preserve the state\u0027s ability to discriminate against a segment of its population.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comNo one is suggesting that Christians are just like the Islamic State. But Obama did suggest that Christianity is like Islam; both faiths have the capacity to be exploited by extremists.Author, Evolving Dharma and God vs. GaySome Alabama probate judges, at least for the time being, are defying the United States Supreme Court today, refusing to grant marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples while other judges throughout the state are granting those licenses.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesMy girlfriend has been asked if she was my nurse. Once, a person blankly asked if she was \"the one who takes care of him.\" We\u0027ve gotten used to this bizarre, recurring question, and often find ways to poke fun at their ignorance.Author, Columnist and BloggerSave your mental energy for productive tasks, such as solving problems and setting goals. When your thoughts aren\u0027t productive, make a conscious effort to shift your mental energy to more helpful topics. The more you practice expending your mental energy wisely, the more it will become a habit.Psychotherapist and author of 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t DoIn Anacortes, Wash., last week, approximately 200 Tesoro workers began picketing the oil refinery where an explosion incinerated seven of their co-workers five years earlier.International President, United SteelworkersAfter decades of observing effective groups with untapped potential suffering from a dearth of funding, I can point to 15 specific missed opportunities by indifferent foundations. Here is my short list of areas where funding is needed but lacking.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe principal goal of these programs is to bolster allies and promote stability. But done poorly, it can fuel conflicts, enable human rights abuses, and draw the United States into unnecessary wars. Unfortunately, U.S. military aid programs perform poorly far too often, and they are growing rapidly without adequate congressional or public scrutiny.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyAny deal that forces women and human rights to take a backseat to profit and trade should be a non-starter. But right now, the United States is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement with 11 nations including Brunei, a country that recently adopted a vicious new penal code threatening the rights and lives of women, lesbians, and gay men.President of The Feminist MajorityDuring Black History Month, I\u0027m reminded yet again of the ways that the struggle for civil rights is interwoven with the struggle for workers\u0027 rights. Perhaps no one better personifies that link than A. Philip Randolph, the first African-American inducted into the Labor Department\u0027s Hall of Honor.U.S. Secretary of LaborThis week we\u0027ve got another study. It quantifies the long-term return on dollars spent to close the gap in educational achievement between rich and poor students. But Republicans want to use \"dynamic scoring\" only on tax cuts for the rich.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u0027s week started with a bad case of foot-in-mouth during his three-day trip to England, and went downhill from there, reaching new lows for ethics and good, open government -- even for New Jersey.Legal Associate for Common Cause in Washington, D.C.The GOP plan would take us back to the days when insurers could sell junk policies, charge older folks more than they can today and calculate premiums based on a person\u0027s health status.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgGiven all current complex problems characterizing the European landscape, Greece must abandon many myths and stereotypes, accept that the country itself is the source of many significant problems and that it should mobilize its own internal forces. Europe on the other hand should also admit to its mistakes.Emeritus Professor of Economics of the University of AthensMost innovations fail. And like NPR Planet Money\u0027s Adam Davidson explains, \"life span of innovations has never shorter, meaning that failure happens more quickly.\" So it is not too soon to start to contemplate of the obituaries of the contemporary school reform movement.Award-winning historian and inner-city teacherIt is hard to think of a phenomenon that has done greater damage to our environment (as well as to our economy and social fabric) than the mass exodus from our older cities and towns that took place in the latter half of the 20th century.Senior Counsel for Environmental Strategies, PlaceMakers LLCAmong the deadliest and cruelest corporate cover-ups in American history is the decades-long effort by the asbestos industry to conceal what it knew about the health impacts of the \"magical mineral.\" There is no small irony, then, in insurers and asbestos-using companies spinning a tale in which they are victimized by powerful lawyers representing asbestos victims.President, Public CitizenI\u0027ve been learning how to be a lesbian lately, because my boyfriend and I opened our relationship last year. Ten productive months into being a sometimes-lesbian, I still have a lot of questions. So I reached out to Natashia Mower, this lesbian I know personally, to set me, well, gay, I guess.Author and Blogger at WritersBucketList.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"THOMAS THROWS IN THE TOWEL: EQUALITY COMING",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
