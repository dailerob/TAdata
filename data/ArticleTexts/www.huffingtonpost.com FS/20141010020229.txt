{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceThe way we talk about incidents of gun violence in this country -- and the solutions we propose to stem future acts of violence -- seems to be dramatically different depending on the race of those involved. Consider the tragic death of 25 year-old African-American Kajieme Powell in St. Louis this summer. It was a textbook example of suicide-by-cop. And yet very little of the subsequent national conversation mentioned the issue of mental health. Instead, we got the standard character assassination that is so common when African-Americans are involved as perpetrators. Conversely, when an episode of mass gun violence involves a white perpetrator, the conversation immediately turns to mental health. The shooter was \"deranged\" and probably on medication, we are told. And we\u0027ll hear asides like, \"He seemed like such a good person\" or \"We never could have seen this coming.\"Decades of observation, monitoring, and research have demonstrated beyond a doubt that the Earth\u0027s climate is changing, that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are to blame, and that the consequences will be devastating unless the world gets serious about reducing emissions. This is not a distant or future challenge. Climate change is affecting millions around the world right now -- today.U.S. Secretary of StateWe often boast of the uniqueness of our system. We are not a totalitarian society that crushes the individual out of existence and tramples over his/her rights and freedoms. But there are questions we need to ask ourselves.British Tunisian writer and Middle East expertThrowing up because you\u0027re building a baby, not because you had one too many tequilas the night before.Mom, wife, marketer and blogger at lifeisalullaby.comThe fact that there are seven highly contested races in solid red states that few people thought would be competitive is a sign that something unusual is going on the small towns and wide open spaces of the Great Plains. It\u0027s not exactly the populist revolt of the 1890s, but it is making things interesting.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersGiven the length of the infiltration and the fact that not one of the 83 million accounts affected got drained, it seems unlikely that theft of funds was the immediate goal of the breach. The more likely scenario is that we are watching a multi-layered crime unfold in real time.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911If as a result Hong Kong can democratize its institutions and equalize its economic success, the city can point the way for the country as a whole.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusAs the drama unfolds and fingers of blame are pointed at the Secret Service over recent breaches of security at the White House, we have a bit of good news/bad news to report.Robert Baer tells me America\u0027s strategy towards a turbulent, resource-rich region of millions of people is driven by American elections. Meanwhile, our knowledge and understanding of ISIS is practically nil anyway.Author of \u0027The Shock and Awing of America: Echoing Consequences of Fear and Alienation\u0027Let\u0027s not lose sight of what this time of year is really about: getting into heated debates about the merits of the season\u0027s most polarizing food items.Writer, blogs at sassandbalderdash.comThe Umbrella Revolution isn\u0027t over nor is it resolved, but rather only just beginning and gathering strength for the next opportunity. Beijing has no reason to celebrate a problem resolved, even as it refuses to choose a path toward democracy and rights.Founder, Human Rights Action CenterDespite what the media might tell women, you don\u0027t have to choose one way of life over the other forever. You can, in fact, change your mind. You can choose and re-choose the direction of your own adventure.EVP and President Americas at Levi Strauss \u0026 Co.Giving something to charity isn\u0027t really the same as living every day with a charitable heart. Granted, we are called to give generously to others from what we have, but a charitable heart goes further.Author of \u0027postChristian\u0027 (Jericho Books)When traveling to areas devastated by earthquakes and violent storms, the physical damage is often apparent even before you step off the plane.Vice President of Emergency Response at AmeriCaresIt is true that the rate of economic growth has quickened, but that rate is still low by pre-recession standards. In July the IMF actually cut the U.S. growth forecast for 2014 to just 1.7 percent, the CBO\u0027s in August was just 1.5 percent. These are not stellar growth numbers.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThis may well be Obama\u0027s last chance to change the widespread perception of being weak and indecisive, and restore America\u0027s image as the indispensable global leader because only the US can lead the battle against ISIS to a successful conclusion.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIt was heinous. It was underhanded. It was beyond the bounds of international morality. It was an attack on the American way of life. It was \"the oil weapon\" -- and back in 1973, it was directed at the United States. Skip ahead four decades and it\u0027s smart, it\u0027s effective, and it\u0027s the American way.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeWhen it came to prosecuting the mortgage crisis, Holder missed the big targets, and countless smaller ones as well.Business Reporter, The Huffington PostKleinbard describes himself as a \"Dutch uncle\" which the dictionary tells me is someone who admonishes sternly and bluntly... tells us the hard truths whether we want to hear them or not.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWe must build field hospitals and Ebola care units, send health-care staff, medical supplies and logistical coordination, as well as supporting governments and NGOs to stop Ebola transmission through community mobilization to avoid risky funeral and care practices.Director of the London School of Hygiene \u0026 Tropical Medicine; Co-discoverer of EbolaAn elite few who take large sums from Big Pharma very likely sway decision making by countless other physicians, who might not even know they are getting a choreographed, yet subtle, sell-job.Author, \"Unaccountable\"In disrobing at bedtime we shed our waking world personas, revealing deeper aspects of who we are. This private picture of our night self, typically shared only with close friends, family, and intimate partners, is framed by our bedclothes.Sleep and dream specialistBringing a country or a region out of conflict has taken leaders coming from the ground up, not leaders installed by a super power to serve its economic interests. There is one word today that such leaders seem to understand, repeat, and live by that seems to separate their successes from failures elsewhere. The word is inclusion.Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownArchbishop Emeritus of Cape TownRitualized IS beheadings tee-us-up for defeat to come. Suddenly confronted with the power and horror of sacral death -- which we are deeply receptive to and yet not equipped to understand -- we move, reflexively, like the monarchies of the 1790s, to simply destroy the bacillus.Professor at The Johns Hopkins University Advanced Academic Programs and the US Naval War CollegeI trust that my partner and I raised our daughter to surround herself with good people. She\u0027s picked you as one of those people and your role is one of the most important pieces of her life puzzle. To me, that puts you in some pretty exceptional company.Father of two and blogger at PuzzlingPosts.comAs my boys approach adulthood and start relationships of their own with women outside our house, I\u0027m more keenly aware of what they learn both here and outside these walls. And sadly, it\u0027s not as simple as letting them choose the pink shirt over the blue one.Celebrating the modern woman’s multi-faceted mindAs columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote: \"They know that illiteracy, ignorance and oppression of women create the petri dish in which extremism can flourish.\" Not always. The young men are not just graduates of the infamous madrassas, some of which are in Syria, Pakistan, and Nigeria and teach a narrow version of the Koran and not much else.Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsFirst, he\u0027s coming into a much better situation in terms of what team he was drafted to, compared to Morrison joining the expansion Bobcats and becoming the most leaned-on player right away with the highest expectations.Director of Content at Tradesports.com, Editor of TradesportsInsider.comDear women voters: It\u0027s our time, ladies. A midterm election looms, and the focus is on us! Politicians and pundits alike know that there\u0027s no crossing the electoral finish line without women voters in their corner. But are the candidates seeking to represent us talking about the issues we care about?Vice President of Government Relations at the American Association of University WomenI\u0027m not going to vow never to dip into Facebook or Twitter, but maybe I\u0027ll go online a little less. I\u0027m going to try to keep reading some novel each night. I\u0027m going to start asking people what books they\u0027re reading instead of what movies they have seen.Series Editor, The Best American Short StoriesAmericans\u0027 commonplace view of ISIL, al Qaeda, and similar groups is one of irrational, hateful savages wreaking havoc as they bomb, rape, and pillage. This view is not wholly mistaken, but it overlooks the causes of this poisonous ideology of Jihadism.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"ONE LANE!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
