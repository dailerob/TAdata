{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostThe realm of the Federal Reserve is arcane to most people, but suffice it to say that it is in something like a control tower overseeing a busy major airport: It is supposed to recognize dangers early enough to do something about them. The Fed tightens the flow of money when investment bubbles begin to emerge. It eases the credit taps when the economy is slowing. It is the ultimate overseer of the financial system, the institution that is supposed to be looking out for signs of dangerous speculation and inadequate transparency. Summers is temperamentally ill-suited for this all-important job. His life can be summed up in a simple equation: Brilliance plus arrogance yields perilous foolishness. His absolute faith in the soundness of his views coupled with his demonstrable tendency to disdain people who disagree have put him on the wrong side of history. We can do far better than hand him the keys to the Fed.Comments (285)Alec BaldwinActorAfter Michael Bloomberg, New York would benefit by electing an official who demonstrates some affinity for the needs of its middle-class citizens. But Anthony Weiner can\u0027t be that person.Comments (254)Amber TamblynWriterTell Gynoticians like Rick Perry, Trent Franks, Pat McCrory and the Pat McCrorys of women like representative Jodie Laubenberg and Marsha Blackburn that enough is enough: We aren\u0027t just coming for their laws, we\u0027re coming for their JOBS.Comments (408)Arianna HuffingtonHumans are built for communication, and anything that helps fill that insatiable need is going to take off. We\u0027re also built for narrative, and, even at 140 characters, Twitter can tap into that, too.CommentsMichael F. JacobsonExecutive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestThe ingredient in question is carmine. It\u0027s a red dye extracted from the dried, pulverized bodies of the cochineal insect -- an unphotogenic arthropod native to Mexico and South America with a fondness for cactus. Dannon uses carmine in four flavors of Fruit on the Bottom yogurt.Comments (93)Rachel Campos-DuffyParenting expert, author, blogger, political pundit and television personalityHuma\u0027s decision to forgive her husband should not be subject to criticism. It\u0027s her right and, indeed, may be a very admirable choice for her family. However, her timing, her choice of venue, and her complicity in her husband\u0027s spectacle has made her unrelatable to millions of everyday women.Comments (27)Simone SmithDigital Identity ConsultantWe all make embarrassing mistakes online. While many warnings have been beaten into us by every cliché article on online etiquette, we have a tendency to recognize errors in other people while remaining blindly unaware of our own faux pas. Don\u0027t become another statistic.Comments (90)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911here are an estimated 1.5 billion credit cards in use in the United States and that can make them seem pretty ubiquitous. Nevertheless, access to credit cards is a privilege not a right, and if you make mistakes, you\u0027ll pay a price -- sometimes a hefty one.Comments (98)Wadah KhanfarJournalist; President, Sharq ForumThree weeks after the toppling of Morsi, with its attendant arbitrary detentions, intimidation, and smear campaigns against his supporters, it is now apparent that the political crisis in the country is further away from a solution.Comments (236)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027As we head toward renewed battles over the debt ceiling, sequester, and government funding, it\u0027s important to understand why Republicans are disciplined and Democrats aren\u0027t. The difference has to do with the kind of personalities the two parties attract.Comments (1,081)Robin BronkCEO, The Creative CoalitionSome politicians have been open about their intention to \"starve the beast.\" Well, this week in Washington, we\u0027ve seen the clearest indication yet of this \"starve the beast\" approach in action. It turns out, though, that the \"beast\" we\u0027re starving is our own children and our investments in their future.Comments (29)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistWe would have to park every single car in America for a full year to make up for the carbon pollution the tar sands pipeline would dump into our atmosphere. Everybody in favor, raise your hand.Comments (196)Jessica Pearce RotondiLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostIt never occurred to me that my mother could be torn between the family she was raising and the family that raised her.Comments (30)Amy L. FreemanDevelopment Director at Bethesda CaresLike most of us, I want to help people in distress. With panhandlers, though, I never knew whether the person was truly in need. I worried that my money would fuel some addiction, rather than funding food or shelter. I worried that I was being scammed. Was I right?Comments (56)Stuart HendersonCultural Historian and Creative ConsultantI\u0027m not saying Phish is inherently better than other bands, or that the Phish concert experience is superior to the typical rock concert. But I am saying that a bad Phish concert is infinitely more interesting than a bad show by, say, Jay Z. Because even a bad Phish show is bound to offer at least a few moments of firecracker brilliance.Comments (13)Josh KlenertHead of UX and Design, The Huffington PostOur photo-illustration of a $-shaped suburban neighborhood was collaged together from nearly 50 satellite images from Google Maps.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAmerican presidents have many jobs. They govern. They lead. They inspire. And if we\u0027re lucky, they continue to set an example even after they\u0027ve left the White House.Comments (33)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureFriedman\u0027s vision is worth studying, if only because it reflects the distorted perspective of some very wealthy and influential people. In their world the problems of the many are as easily fixed as a line of code, with no sacrifice required of them or their fellow billionaires.Comments (97)Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureIn a speech delivered at Knox College in Illinois, Barack Obama launched his final campaign: a campaign to revive the American Dream. It is worth understanding the scope -- and the limits -- of the president\u0027s vision.Comments (120)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupI believe Dylan is following his muse, plain and simple. And why wouldn\u0027t he? The muse made him famous at the ripe old age of 22. The muse gave him -- and us -- the many, many timeless songs he has composed. If the muse is telling him to play night after night, who is he to say, \"Aw, thanks for the invitation, but there\u0027s a dinner party in Malibu I don\u0027t want to miss\"?Comments (41)Marcia CrossAward-winning actressWhere I sit now is simply in awe, in awe of women \"leaning in\" and \"leaning out\" and the brilliance of their day-to-day achievements. Both journeys are all encompassing and require talent, endurance and devotion.Comments (46)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostIf you think Anthony Weiner is a monster for degrading his marriage, maybe you should avoid doing the same in gigantic block letters on the front cover of your tabloid.Comments (233)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Some say that we should wait again, wait longer to work on the immigration system, wait until later, do it slowly, over time, down the road, piece by piece. But the time has come to see the urgency of fixing this broken immigration system and begin to heal the nation.Comments (30)Penny WilsonGeneral practitioner and obstetricianSometimes I get the distinct impression that the general public believes that doctors graduate from medical school as middle aged men. It\u0027s understandable really. After all, that\u0027s what TV has taught us.Comments (82)Tom Zeller Jr.MIT Knight Science Journalism FellowThe Iberian lynx might soon fall victim to a trend in extinction that is outpacing millions of years of evolution for the planet\u0027s plants and animals, scientists suggest. Human-driven global warming is a key culprit, and unless things change, the future is likely to become a far less biologically diverse.Comments (202)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWeiner and Abedin are perhaps the highest profile interfaith couple in America and the troubles in their relationship have the potential to be used as another case in point of those issuing dire warnings about interfaith marriages.Comments (268)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersLarry Summers is the wrong guy for the wrong job at the wrong time. This pick is terrible politics and worse substance.CommentsVictor J. WilliPhD History, Oxford UniversityIt remains to be seen how large the numbers will be who will follow Egyptian Commander of the Armed Forces Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi\u0027s call, and whether al-Sisi indeed commands the authority to mobilize large sections of Egyptians into the streets. It is by all means a risky strategy.CommentsAmy TraubSenior Policy Analyst at DemosPresident Obama is right to commit the remainder of his presidency to reviving the American middle class. Both his legislative agenda and his executive actions have great potential for moving the nation forward.Comments (250)Ryan Costello and Lara FriedmanIran\u0027s election of Hassan Rouhani presents the best opportunity for serious progress on diplomatic negotiations with Iran in over eight years. But the future of diplomacy with Iran now lies with the House of Representatives.Comments (49)Shelley NoldenMother, wife, financial analyst, writer and cancer survivorAs any chemo veteran knows, it ain\u0027t easy being bald. Some patients can pull off a wig with panache. Others, to my great admiration, go boldly bald. I took the hat approach -- and gave it my all.CommentsNeil Harbisson, 2013.26.07Ben Thomas, 2013.26.07Larry Strauss, 2013.26.07Shira Lazar, 2013.26.07Daoud Kuttab, 2013.26.07HomeAway, 2013.26.07Halle Eavelyn, 2013.26.07Christine Negroni, 2013.26.07Meg Pier, 2013.26.07Kevin Richberg, 2013.26.07Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SENATE DEMS SWARM AGAINST SUMMERS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
