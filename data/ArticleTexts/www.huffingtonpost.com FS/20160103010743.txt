{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe start of this New Year finds America at an inflection point as wars and terrorism abroad are echoed in violence, suspicion and fear at home. How will we meet the moment? We are better than this. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great German Protestant theologian who died opposing Hitler’s holocaust, believed that the test of the morality of a society is how it treats its children. We flunk Bonhoeffer’s test every hour of every day in America as we let the violence of guns and the violence of poverty relentlessly stalk and sap countless child lives. Those of us who remember McCarthyism see familiar signs in the hatred aimed at Muslims, refugees and immigrants. The pervasive and relentless threat of terror continues to attack and frighten children and adults from Syria to Paris to California and in our cities and rural areas. There is another way.More U.S. military personnel have been sent to Iraq and Syria. Trainers, Special Forces, and airstrikes haven\u0027t been enough. The administration continues its slow progression to renewed ground combat. President Barack Obama\u0027s Nobel Peace Prize grows more tarnished by the day.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIf loyalty, anger and support are all key elements in Trump\u0027s current dominance of the Republican presidential field, rolling each back - and doing so in a progressive manner - is equally key to ensuring that that dominance does not persist into the general election itself.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsNatalie Cole appeared many times as a guest on my PBS television program. One particular appearance, however, was exceedingly delicate and heartrending. She had just received a life-saving kidney transplant, but felt guilty to still be alive. What she had to share that day was, well, unforgettable.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe dreaded New Year\u0027s Resolution is upon us. But fear not! These delicious, guilt-free snacks will help you reach your goal in no time.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomThe twin conflicts raging in Iraq and Syria have unleashed an unsettling dynamic that is transforming both the Middle East and the world beyond this deeply troubled region.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Being awesome in the morning takes discipline and time to master. Early waking hours are not easy, which is why it\u0027s a beautiful thing if you can feel great and make the most out of your mornings. If you\u0027re not eagerly jumping out of bed to start your day then you\u0027ll want to consider these signs that you need to tweak your morning routine:Life Coach \u0026 Empowerment CoachThis year I\u0027ve made only one travel resolution. And I do think that it\u0027s the most important one of all: Keep traveling. So I\u0027m resolving to keep on traveling in 2016 and beyond, and I hope you do as well, for your own well-being and for the well-being of us all.Author, Travel Tales I Couldn\u0027t Put in the GuidebooksSocial justice and standing up to systematic oppression is a rich part of American Muslim history. If American Muslims are to reject #BlackLivesMatter, we are effectively rejecting the legacy of people like Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, pillars of the history of Islam in America.Student, Vanderbilt UniversityPeople should start listening to the transgender community when we say something is going horribly, horribly wrong inside medical institutions with power over us. It\u0027s time for the 80 percent desistance figure to be relegated to the same junk science bin as the utterly discredited link between vaccines and autism.Director of Advocacy, SPARTASomething Wicked This Way Comes is not only a sinister 1962 fantasy novel by Ray Bradbury, it is also descriptive of the malevolent and growing power of white supremacy in the United States.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminarySince we arbitrarily impose a beginning and an end on our equitable distribution of days, let\u0027s reflect on some of the cycles that dominate our existence: the big ones over which we have no control, the smaller ones we might hope to influence, and those about which we don\u0027t yet know.Physics Professor, Harvard University; Author, \u0027Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe\u0027It is baffling, and that is putting it mildly, that Bernie and his advisers have been so obtuse when it comes to crafting a viable media strategy designed to showcase the notion of political revolution front and center.Author, \u0027Revolution! South America and the Rise of the New Left\u0027Does there really exist an industry of deeply funded anti-tax lobbyists whose sole purpose is to protect the holdings of their clients? Absolutely -- far from \"mistaken,\" that narrative is exactly right. Do they win every fight? Nope, and they lost the one that led the capital gains rate to go up in 2013. But to suggest that this one change alters the fundamental landscape of our tax avoidance problem would be an egregious overstatement.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf you vote for anyone other than Bernie Sanders in 2016, you\u0027re simply not a progressive. You\u0027re also voting for endless wars with Trump or Clinton, while Bernie Sanders says \"I\u0027ll be dammed\" to more quagmires.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comPerhaps on some level there is truth to some facets of these stereotypical roles that are pounded into the minds of the American TV viewer. It is not, however, the image of the justice system I see in my day-to-day work as a public defender.Attorney at LawMembers of the Christian right should be among the strongest supporters of the Establishment Clause, because it allows them to believe what they want, even if what they want is anathema to freedom of religion.Professor of Religious Studies and Human Dimensions of Organizations, University of Texas, AustinDoes pain keep you up at night? How do you handle your pain? Does your mattress play a role in your pain management?Writer\"I wasn\u0027t sure what to expect from this poor boy and was preparing myself for a very lethargic and slow moving pup. Well, to my utter surprise, in walks Adalard, nub wagging, bounce in his step, and ready to receive and give love.\"Photographer, rescuer, blogger, retired psychotherapist robynarouty.comIt\u0027s unrealistic to expect that you can create a life that is 100% happy moments. Chasing a problem-free life actually makes you unhappy because every bump in the road is viewed as evidence of failure. A better goal is to increase your happiness by 20%. Here are three ways to do it:Creator of Noble Purpose in business conceptAfter a few weeks of grieving I\u0027m so tired of my head, riding the roller-coaster of loss again and again. I crash, then come up to refocus my attention on living again; read a book with my son, do some coloring, punch the bag at the gym, work out dinner... get through the days on a micro-level, nerve by nerve.Psychologist, couple therapist, university lecturer, wife, mumDo you make New Year resolutions? I don\u0027t bother because they usually fall off my radar by mid January. Starting the year with failure is not my goal. Here are 25 simple things I will incorporate into my days in 2016.

Pro-aging troublemaker, searching for the perfect foundation shade since 1973.Late Friday afternoon, reports circulated that Erdogan expressed admiration for Hitler\u0027s Nazi government.

That\u0027s not a loss. That\u0027s a win.Writer, Bob Dylan fan, memorized every line in \u0027Casablanca\u0027Donald Trump has nothing in common with the overwhelmed, alienated, angry and forgotten. He may have the skill to speak to them as though he is sympatico, but he isn\u0027t. He has his every need -- and whim -- attended to immediately. He is the antithesis of alienated.Journalist/ProducerMy Wednesday morning spin class was taught by a substitute instructor today. In the place of my usual wonderful teacher was one of those drill sergeant-y types that thinks the louder the music is (and the louder he yells) the harder you will work.Wife, Twin Mommy, bloggymamma.comAt a time when America is experiencing an upsurge of progressive organizing and activism -- from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter to Bernie Sanders\u0027 campaign for president -- we need a regular columnist who can explain what\u0027s going on, why its happening, and what it means.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeOne of the most critical questions will be whether the prosecutors can present evidence relating to the many other accusations made against Cosby by other women.
