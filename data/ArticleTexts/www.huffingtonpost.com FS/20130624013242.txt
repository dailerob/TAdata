{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, the NBA Finals came down to a breath-taking final game, with LeBron and the Heat ultimately repeating as champs -- while, in DC, the Supreme Court pushed its ruling on gay marriage to the SCOTUS equivalent of a Game 7 (here\u0027s hoping legal superstars David Boise and Ted Olson take home the MVP trophy). As we also wait for the High Court\u0027s ruling on Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a different ghost of the pre-civil rights South reared its ugly head, with Paula Deen losing her job for using \"the N-word\" and planning a \"plantation-style\" wedding for her brother. Meanwhile, the name for Kim and Kanye\u0027s baby is no longer pending. Some questioned their parenting compass after they went with a compass pun, but at least they didn\u0027t go with \"Yeezus.\"Comments (26)Susan SarandonActress, activist and motherIn 2012 I supported Amendment 64 in Colorado, a common sense step toward ending the archaic prohibition mindset that has resulted in the U.S. leading the world in the incarceration of our people -- a prison system packed with non-violent drug offenders.Comments (475)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.It is dangerous to have a technology-empowered government capable of amassing private data; it is even more dangerous to privatize this Big Brother world.Comments (386)Arianna HuffingtonThe biggest movie of the summer is a new documentary called How to Make Money Selling Drugs, and it exposes the hypocrisy, insanity, and destructiveness of America\u0027s drug war. Now, when I say \"biggest,\" I\u0027m not talking about budget size or box office receipts -- I\u0027m talking impact and importance. Of course, the problem with saying a movie is \"important\" is that it can leave the impression that it isn\u0027t entertaining. That\u0027s certainly not the case with this film.Comments (463)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolToday\u0027s pace and stress are so great that people are searching for new practices to find resilience in the midst of chaos, and mindfulness programs are helping them find better ways to live.Comments (146)Chelsea ClintonBoard member, Clinton FoundationThe astounding number of disconnected youth also creates long-term risks for our country. To address the significant challenges posed by youth disconnection, we must develop and implement effective solutions targeting specific needs of specific populations.Comments (93)Christopher HayesHost, \u0027All In with Chris Hayes\u0027The 33-year-old reporter and author died early Tuesday morning in a car wreck -- a brutal, tragic loss that has robbed the world of an exemplary journalist, and singularly talented writer. He wrote detailed, diligent, riveting reportorial prose and he was also kind, generous, charming and earnest.Comments (49)Melinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationWhen Germany and other wealthy nations came together to create the Global Fund a decade ago, AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria were leading causes of death in developing countries. But world leaders recognized that they could make dramatic gains against these three diseases.Comments (34)Desmond Tutu1984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerIf the corporate thinking that places profits over our own humanity has begun to invade the American university system, causing it to bow to pressure from some of the worst human rights violators in our world today in favor of expansion into the Chinese market, it has gone too far.Comments (69)Dr. Jill BidenSecond Lady of the United StatesSmall businesses play a critical role in helping our economy, but to stay competitive they need access to a motivated, flexible and skilled workforce.Comments (164)Richard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupIt shouldn\u0027t just be left to politicians and community organizations to tackle the world\u0027s problems -- businesses should help, too. Although individually lots of businesses do great things, collectively they could be far more powerful and do much more good.Comments (80)Muhammad YunusNobel Peace Prize winner and founder of Grameen BankGrameen Bank has been built with the funds of the poor women. How can the Inquiry Commission propose to hand over the majority shares of an organization which is owned 97 percent by private citizens to the government?Comments (25)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundMany leaders and philosophers say we should end poverty, but through his visionary innovation, tireless hands-on work, and dogged unwillingness to accept it, Dr. Muhammad Yunus has made ending the cycle of poverty a reality.Comments (413)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Skepticism is a good and healthy thing. But cynicism is a spiritually dangerous thing because it is a buffer against personal commitment. Personal commitment is all that has ever changed the world, transformed human lives, and altered history.Comments (180)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundThese bills are more than staggering. They have nothing to do with protecting women. They will not promote health care. They are dangerous, they are extreme, and women are already paying the price in states where they have been enacted.Comments (773)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorToday, the federal minimum wage stands at $7.25 per hour. Had it simply kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would be about $10.70 per hour, which amounts to nearly $300,000 in lost wages. So where did the billions of lost wages go?Comments (396)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistIt takes a lot of courage -- and honesty -- to admit you were wrong, and Alan Chambers has done just that. This week, he announced plans to shut down his controversial Christian ministry, Exodus International, which was the country\u0027s largest organization devoted to \"curing\" homosexuality, and he issued a public apology to the LGBT community for the harm he has done to them over the years.Comments (83)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationMalala Yousafzai -- the 15-year-old Pakistani girl militants tried to assassinate -- is the first signatory of a new worldwide petition launched today after terrorists, hell-bent on preventing girls being educated, murdered 14 students at an all girls\u0027 college in Pakistan.Comments (18)Candy ChangArtist, TED Senior FellowContemplating death is a powerful tool to re-appreciate the present and remember what makes your life meaningful to you. We\u0027re all trying to make sense of our lives and there\u0027s great comfort in knowing you\u0027re not alone.Comments (389)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkNobody should be denied the right to vote, or face additional hurdles because of a strategic method to disenfranchise them. Just as no one should be racially profiled, no one should be racially blocked from the voting booth.Comments (541)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzU.S. Representative from Florida\u0027s 23rd Congressional DistrictWhen I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I was advised to be tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations. Like thousands of women before me, and thousands since, I had the devastating experience of making life-altering decisions based on the results of one test.Comments (88)Shimon PeresPresident of the State of IsraelWe don\u0027t have enemies. There is no country, no religion, which we consider an enemy. Our only enemies are those who reject peace, sow division, and spread hatred.Comments (407)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarUltimately, what kids watch isn\u0027t up to the MPAA. In truth, the responsibility for monitoring children\u0027s viewing of films lies with parents, who should investigate movies thoroughly before introducing them to any underage child.Comments (130)Newt GingrichFormer U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives and GOP presidential candidateAnyone who has been paying attention knows that bureaucrats throughout the government are routinely abusing their power to advance their ideology and that of the current administration. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the administration\u0027s aggressive obstruction of American energy.Comments (358)Robin BronkCEO, The Creative CoalitionIn order to live life, one must experience art.CommentsHRH The Prince of WalesHRH The Prince of WalesAll of my efforts over the past forty years have been concerned essentially with one central principle - the well-being of the individual. Not the isolated individual. My emphasis has constantly been on the individual within community. People do not thrive without the support of a community so, in my view, if the hope is that people prosper, find happiness and feel that all important sense of satisfaction and belonging, then we have to maintain the fabric of community and not let it become threadbare.Comments (41)Margaret Wheeler JohnsonWomen\u0027s EditorAli and I are very different. These differences serve us well when it comes time to face the world each day. They were not so useful when it came to planning how we would get hitched.Comments (98)Simon JohnsonAuthor, \u0027White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You\u0027Global megabanks and their friends are pushing back hard against the idea that additional reforms are needed beyond what is supposed to be implemented as part of the Dodd-Frank 2010 financial legislation.Comments (235)Tammy BleckWitty Woman WritingTry not to criticize yourself, second guess your feelings, doubt your abilities or be too hard on yourself when you think you\u0027ve failed. The world does all those things for you and it is your job to stand up to it, not give in to it.Comments (64)Jim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupOver the last 20 years, the World Bank Group has helped countries lift 663 million people out of poverty. In the next 20, we believe it is possible to end extreme poverty. This goal is within our grasp. But if we don\u0027t confront climate change, we won\u0027t end poverty.Comments (78)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThe Farm Bill that is expected to pass the U.S. House this week explains income inequality in America. The Republican-sponsored proposal slashes food stamps for poor children and pads farm subsidies for wealthy agri-businessmen.Comments (230)Sasha Lotrian, 2013.23.06Steve Rosenbaum, 2013.23.06M.
