{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupIt\u0027s almost Biden Time, a more urgent campaign moment than he or anyone else could have imagined a few days ago. After a political career that has lasted 42 years so far, the genial vice president and former senator faces the most critical task of his electoral life: helping his boss dig out of the avalanche that buried him in Denver. At 69 years of age and heading towards the twilight of his time on the stage, Joe Biden on Thursday will confront Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has been on Earth only six years longer (42) than the number of years Biden served as a U.S. senator from Delaware (36). Simply put, the Obama-Biden team can\u0027t afford another weak, confused and defensive performance against the Republican ticket after the one the president turned in Wednesday in the West.Read Post | Comments (2,963)Gary Hart, 10/07/12President, Hart International, Ltd.Myths play a central role as metaphor in many world religions, but myths in politics are dangerous.

We welcome him back not as a comedian whose material has gotten better with age -- or one recovering from a period of decline -- but as we would a 90s time capsule.Read Post | Comments (269)John Tirman, 10/08/12Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesRomney\u0027s foibles as a foreign policy candidate are plentiful and easy targets. Obama\u0027s record is fairly solid and has many genuine achievements. But chances are strong that the next debate will again be \"won\" by Romney -- if Obama retreats to defensive mode.Read Post | Comments (17)Alex Schriver, 10/08/12National Chairman of the College Republican National CommitteeThe recent criticisms of Mitt Romney\u0027s willingness to end subsidies to PBS merit laughter worthy of Tickle Me Elmo.Read Post | Comments (190)Jeff Connaughton, 10/08/12Author, THE PAYOFF: Why Wall Street Always WinsNeither Mitt Romney and the Republicans nor President Obama and many Democrats favor breaking up the big banks, the best way to prevent another taxpayer bailout after a financial crisis.Read Post | Comments (14)Michelangelo Signorile, 10/08/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhat the Boy Scouts of America did last week was among the most grotesque examples of its anti-gay policy to date.

Swanee Hunt, 10/08/12Accepting the trafficking of women and girls as a norm coarsens our culture. In a recent address, our President said, \"as a nation, we\u0027ve long rejected such cruelty.\" Yet sadly, with each purchase of another human, we become that much more callous to the casual cruelty of trafficking.Read Post | CommentsSusan McBride, 10/06/12Author, \u0027IN THE PINK: How I Met the Perfect (Younger) Man, Survived Breast Cancer, and Found True Happiness After 40\u0027Will I ever take my health for granted again? No. That\u0027s why I get nervous every six months when I have my regular boobal check-ups and why I see my doctors whenever anything feels the slightest bit wonky.Read Post | Comments (18)Larry Pressler, 10/08/12Former U.S. Senator from South DakotaAs a life-long Republican, I stand by him as he stands by all of us, putting national allegiance ahead of party affiliation.

Wilson, 10/08/12CEO, JC Wilson International VenturesThe Republicans want to work people into a lather over fictional voter fraud while the real problem is Republican led voter suppression, intimidation and outright cheating.Read Post | Comments (224)Sarah Tuttle-Singer, 10/08/12Social Media Director, TimesofIsrael.comIt turns out there is something worse than feeling homesick in the Homeland.

Learsy, 10/07/12Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027Governor Romney may call himself a Republican, but he is not a Republican of the iconic stature of President Reagan.

Gerard, 10/08/12International President, United SteelworkersNow you see severely conservative Romney, now you don\u0027t.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThere\u0027s a time for larger deficits and a time to be moving toward budget surplus.
