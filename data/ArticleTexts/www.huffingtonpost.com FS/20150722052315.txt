{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Like many people following the negotiations between Greece and its creditors, I was inclined to see Wolfgang Schauble, Germany\u0027s finance minister, as the villain of the story. After all, Mr. Schauble insisted on severely punitive measures for Greece as a condition for continuing support from the European Central Bank. He appeared to be the bad cop relative to others in the negotiations, such as Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was willing to make at least some concessions to keep Greece in the euro. But a more careful analysis arguably leads to the opposite conclusion. Schauble did not argue for throwing Greece out of the euro simply as a punitive measure. He argued, quite possibly sincerely, that at least a temporary departure from the euro zone would be the best path forward for Greece.Apparently, the GOP is under the impression that since the party was able to score a victory in 2014 without reigning in its anti-choice, anti-birth-control, anti-woman agenda, they have a free hand to play to their radical base. That\u0027s the wrong strategy for several reasons.President, People For the American WayIf Sarah Palin has been consistent about anything, it\u0027s that she\u0027s been a backstab artist her entire political career. As predictably as the melting of Alaska\u0027s glaciers, Palin blamed the dust-up between Trump and McCain on \"those on the Left and lazy media lapdogs.\"Author and filmmakerJust post a picture of your bump or a bump you love on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter using #BumpDay. Every bump is welcome.Author, \u0027What to Expect\u0027 seriesTrans persons are quite capable of taking care of themselves, and when given the right tools, sufficient financial support and a network of supportive allies, are capable of mounting a mission to bring about real equality.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandOn this fifth anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Act, I wish I was writing a congratulatory letter to all the regulatory agencies in Washington, D.C. for its successful implementation. Instead, I\u0027m expressing the frustration of millions of working families who believe there is a lot of work still to be to done to rein in Wall Street excess.President, AFL-CIOI spoke with Till Roenneberg about the effects of \"social jet lag\" on our behavior and performance, the changes schools and companies can make to accommodate our biological needs, and the aggressive campaign required to take away the \"coolness\" of sleep deprivation.Associate Editor, The Huffington PostIt is high time the American public demanded a full debate over veterans issues by their political leaders, especially those who aspire to the highest office in the land. But they are not going to get it when the candidates involved spent a lifetime either avoiding military service, or wrapping themselves in the glory of their own military service.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027If Iran poses an \"existential\" threat to Israel and to the Arab-Sunnis, perhaps the time has come for them to reach a deal on the Palestinian issue? The Iran deal may be the first step in a process that would allow Middle Easterners to finally start writing their own histories instead of expecting Washington to.Senior Analyst, WikistratHere are a list of the questions and thoughts that came to mind after reading about this company and the current security breach.Blogger at That\u0027s InappropriateI respect William G. Bowen for his distinguished leadership in education, but take strong exception to his rejection of the growing movement for university divestment from fossil fuel holdings.

Let the beeps beep, the pings ping and the alerts land on deaf ears. Turn away from your screen, and toward your children. You won\u0027t regret it.Family therapist, Author, Parenting With Presence, Parenting Without Power StrugglesSome in Congress are furious at the UN for poking its nose into American geopolitical decision-making without first waiting for Capital Hill to act. They insist that America will not be subservient to the UN when making geopolitical decisions of this nature. But this is a totally specious argument, as evidenced by recent history.Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationFor Whites, saying we loved The Wire may earn us some social capital among more progressive-leaning friends, but unless that social capital is mobilized somehow--unless our attitudes, our voting rates, our actions change--little else happens.Associate Professor of Rhetoric at the University of Richmond.The normally talkative woman was speechless after the last Kansas legislative session.

I was obsessively checking my iPhone and setting a terrible example for my daughter, who repeatedly asked why she couldn\u0027t have an iPad when all her 5-year-old friends did.Author, blogger at MommyAtoZBlog.comGermany\u0027s disregard for Greek lives didn\u0027t begin during WWII. It can also be traced back to WWI. For Germany, any policy that advanced its economic or commercial interests, no matter how horrendous and inhumane was and, apparently, still is acceptable.Author of Not Even My Name, and A Lid for Every Pot, painter, former WBAI news correspondent.Let\u0027s be clear -- the overwhelming majority of my fellow Mexicans are decent, hardworking people who are trying to support their families. They have far more in common with American workers than either of us does with a billionaire like Trump.The President and General Secretary of the National Union of Mine, Metal, Steel and Allied Workers of the Mexican Republic (Los Mineros).You talk about transitioning to clean energy sources, but tapping into Arctic oil reserves would open a spigot that would be politically difficult for you or future presidents to turn off.Oceans Director, Center for Biological DiversityConsidering that the agreement is practically a done deal, how should Israel act to assure that it\u0027s security interests do not suffer? While Prime Minister Netanyahu continues to attack the agreement, I and many in Israel believe that it\u0027s time to deal with this worrying and uncertain situation in a sensible manner.Member of Knesset Ksenia Svetlova (Zionist Union) Expert in Middle Eastern affairs and Islamic studies, member of Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense CommitteeSANTO DOMINGO -- There\u0027s more to the Dominican Republic refugee crisis than just politics. It\u0027s the lives of thousands that suffer from the consequences of these policies that should be on the forefront of this discussion.Editor in chief, Listín DiarioATHENS -- The plan is politically toxic because the fund, though domiciled in Greece, will effectively be managed by the troika. It did not have to be this way. At a turning point in European history, our innovative alternative was thrown into the dustbin.Former Finance Minister of GreeceHumerous experiments on male and female non-human animals fail to reliably hold up in humans, and many prominent researchers have argued we need to develop non-animal models in order to learn more about serious diseases from which numerous humans suffer.Professor emeritus of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of ColoradoThe middle class no longer has a voice.
