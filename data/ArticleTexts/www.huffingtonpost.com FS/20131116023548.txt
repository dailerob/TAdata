Many politicians expect little from the Fed because they think it has less power and flexibility than it does. For its part, the right thinks it has exercised more power than it has. Yellen won\u0027t transform anybody\u0027s view of the Fed, but at least she has a sense of the gravity of our ongoing economic situation. Too bad the same can\u0027t be said for some of the senators who interrogated her Thursday.Comments (15)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Never give up! It\u0027s more than just a platitude.
