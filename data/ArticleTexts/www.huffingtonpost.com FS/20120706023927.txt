{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityThe malaise is palpable, from both sides. Mitt Romney is clearly a consolation prize to every single member of the GOP except twenty or so CEOs, while for many on the other side the almost impossible magic of electing a young, charismatic black man as leader of the free world has inexorably given way to a low-grade depression, both fiscal and psychic.
