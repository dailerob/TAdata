{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageOur life chances are now determined to an unprecedented degree by the wealth of our parents. That\u0027s not always been the case. The faith that anyone could move from rags to riches -- with enough guts and gumption, hard work and nose to the grindstone -- was once at the core of the American Dream. And equal opportunity was the heart of the American creed. Although imperfectly achieved, that ideal eventually propelled us to overcome legalized segregation by race, and to guarantee civil rights. It fueled efforts to improve all our schools and widen access to higher education. It pushed the nation to help the unemployed, raise the minimum wage, and provide pathways to good jobs. Much of this was financed by taxes on the most fortunate. But for more than three decades we\u0027ve been going backwards.Comments (208)Timothy KarrCampaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comSo what gives? Why has one of the most revered news operations -- a program that has won more Emmy Awards than any other TV news organization -- turned its back on the kind of shoe-leather investigative reporting that has earned it a record-setting audience?Comments (12)Grace BucheleBlogger, howibecametexan.comAs the \"white\" half of a Japanese-American couple, I noticed some of the same questions keep popping up again and again. After a quick chat with some other interracial couples, I realized my experiences were not unique.Comments (315)Lewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyAll humor is situational, but the forms of it that survive the traveling in time speak to the fundamental truth of the human predicament, which is that men die from time to time and worms do eat them. The jokes dependent upon a specific historical setting don\u0027t have much of a shelf life.CommentsSoraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderHe is endearing and he\u0027s 6 and \"boys will be boys.\" But, the girl he kissed without permission is also probably endearing, also 6 and not interested in his touching her. The hard and unpleasant part is the idea that her right not to be involved in his working through learning self-control is legitimate.Comments (92)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOInvestors have responded favorably to the outcome of today\u0027s highly-anticipated Federal Reserve policy meeting, and rightly so. Here are four key takeaways that speak to more than this afternoon\u0027s impressive market moves; they also shed light on what may be ahead.CommentsJeffrey Sachs and Irwin Redlener, M.D.We call attention to the overwhelming evidence that investing in the health and education of children is the highest-return investment available to society. We recognize the critical role of parents and a range of support programs that enrich the years of early development.CommentsJessica Ciencin HenriquezFreelance Writer and Author of the upcoming novel, Lies I\u0027ve Told My Therapist.I\u0027ve logged 24,600 miles in air travel this year alone, half of those with my infant son (who slept peacefully like the little cherub he is). I\u0027m here to set the record straight. It is too often the adults that act like babies.CommentsMJ RosenbergBlogger, Huffington Post, Tikkun, Washington SpectatorWorst of all is the fact that this resolution would empower Israel to make the decision to go to war for us. Israel would decide it feels threatened and we would have to back an attack on Iran with \"military force,\" not to mention all the other forms of support the resolution spells out.CommentsLincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityThe ruling itself is interesting, but the question of how any administration, Democratic or Republican believed that surveillance of that kind was, or should be legal, is more significant.Comments (13)Valerie AlexanderAuthor, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027Choose the man who will take care of the laundry and change the baby\u0027s diapers when you\u0027ve got the flu, rather than the one who spent a month choreographing his proposal so that the video of it would go viral.Comments (254)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Consumers just have to prepare for the day that they inevitably will have to deal with an identity theft issue, because it\u0027s no longer a matter of \"if\": It\u0027s a matter of \"when.\"CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeIt\u0027s just unfortunate that Obama couldn\u0027t send Baucus to a democratic country so he could see first-hand what a decent universal health care system looks like.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIt\u0027s weird how Republicans seem to love the Democratic parts of the health care law but aren\u0027t so keen on the Republican parts of the law. But I suppose that\u0027s where guys like Hannity come in: to twist and distort reality so that these uncomfortable and irritating truths don\u0027t get injected into his audience\u0027s epistemic bubble.Comments (322)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureInstead of alleviating the problem of long-term unemployment, the use of credit scores in hiring makes it worse. On a societal level, that\u0027s indefensible. And on an individual level, it\u0027s inhumane.Comments (31)Kyaw MinChairman of the Democracy and Human Rights Party in BurmaMy wife, son, two daughters and I spent the next seven years in prison. They said our \"crime\" was declaring our rights as ethnic Rohingya. My jailers told me that speaking up for the Rohingya was giving Myanmar \"a bad name\" internationally.CommentsIngrid NewkirkPresident and co-founder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)You can still buy Sis the sweater and Mom that new purse without getting a lump of coal from Santa for supporting cruelty to animals. Whether you\u0027re looking for the latest trends or timeless pieces that are always in style, here\u0027s how to do it.Comments (12)John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusKim the Third might seem, with his Falstaffian girth, more a figure of humor than a figure to be feared. Appearances have proven deceiving. He has quickly demonstrated that, like his grandfather, he will act decisively and ruthlessly to maintain his perch.CommentsLori FerraroWriter and actorThey say that when you have kids you get to relive the magic of the holidays all over again, see Christmas through their eyes. I suppose that\u0027s true -- to an extent.CommentsEvan BailynInternet entrepreneur; Bestselling author; Child advocateAt their best, our classic yuletide anthems always seem to find that impossible balance between timelessness and nostalgia. But can we continue loving songs that consist largely of bubblegum, Biebers and \"Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer\"?CommentsDaphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstAfter Ramzi Bin al Shibh four times objected in court this week to the noisiness of his prison cell at night, the judge presiding over the September 11 military commission case on Thursday ordered he undergo a mental competency examination and stalled the case.CommentsRabbi Shmuly YanklowitzEducator, activist and writerI am coming out of the closet. I am an Orthodox rabbi and an advocate for gay marriage. I am pro-gay-rights because I am an Orthodox rabbi, not in spite of it.Comments (11)Gwen CooperNew York Times bestselling author of the memoir \"Homer\u0027s Odyssey\" and the novel \"Love Saves the Day.\"I have a kitten about seven months old who likes to bite me! Whenever someone else holds him, he\u0027s like a little prince, then he bites me. He has about 327 balls, a tent with toys inside, a carpet tree and all the attention he could ever hope for. So what\u0027s up with the biting?CommentsHadi GhaemiExecutive Director, International Campaign for Human Rights in IranProgress towards a nuclear deal should by no means lessen international attention to the human rights violations that have reached crisis levels in Iran since the disputed 2009 election and which continue to this day despite the election of Hassan Rouhani.CommentsClaire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWho taught me to be confident, brave, and self-sufficient? Alanna the Lioness, Lyra Belacqua, Jo March and many other YA heroines who refused to let gender roles hold them back.Comments (23)Jason StanfordDemocratic consultant and writerThere\u0027s ample evidence that state officials have put the lazy in laissez faire when it comes to providing effective oversight of Pearson\u0027s massive contract.CommentsBill Moyers and Michael WinshipThis grim anniversary of the Newtown, Conn., killings, with 28 dead, reminded us of that moment back in 2000 when Charlton Heston made his defiant boast at the NRA convention that gun control advocates would have to pry his rifle from his \"cold, dead hands.\"Comments (303)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesLittle boys and girls in Catholic schools all across the world are still being taught that homosexuality is \"intrinsically disordered.\" And Catholic teachers have been removed from jobs simply for exercising their rights as gay Americans. I haven\u0027t heard the pope weigh in or stop it, while many other people are actually fighting the fight for them.Comments (154)Trita Parsi, Bijan Khajehpour and Reza MarashiThe historic interim agreement between the permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany (P5 1) and Iran over its nuclear dispute is not just about enrichment, centrifuges and breakout capabilities.Comments (22)Arianna HuffingtonWith the holidays almost here, Cindi Leive, Mika Brzezinski and I have decided that there is no better time to unplug, recharge and renew ourselves in time for the new year. And what better way to do that than by unplugging and disconnecting from all our devices?Comments (33)Ethan NadelmannExecutive Director, Drug Policy AllianceI\u0027m not one to use the term \"tipping point\" lightly, because one can only say you\u0027ve hit it so many times before losing one\u0027s credibility, but I do think we\u0027ve hit the tipping point on marijuana legalization -- for three reasons.CommentsJarryd Willis, 2013.19.12Maureen Anderson, 2013.19.12Lubomir Kavalek, 2013.19.12Ging Cristobal, 2013.19.12John Haydon, 2013.19.12Kevin Yu, 2013.19.12Francesca Koe, 2013.19.12Tilman Ehrbeck, 2013.19.12Jon Eig, 2013.19.12Marwan Bishara, 2013.19.12Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"BACKLASH VS.
