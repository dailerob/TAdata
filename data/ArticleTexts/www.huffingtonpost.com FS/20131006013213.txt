{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis week there is some good news from D.C. in the midst of all the dismal Congressional news on the shutdown. Over the last several years, D.C. has made a series of decisions that have made the city a model of best practices for its youngest children. Imagine what could happen in America if many of the dysfunctional self-serving members of Congress had the common sense to focus on what is truly important: investing in rather than undermining America’s children and future with cheap fleeting political posturing. Communities and governments all across the country can learn from the strides Washington, D.C. is making for its young children. And I hope they will.Comments (67)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.If you live in a vacuum-packed world of talk radio, right-wing dominated town halls, and campaigns financed by anti-government billionaires, and if that\u0027s the only Kool-Aid you drink, it must be a shock when you confront the real world. \"Why is this park closed?\" \"Because you closed it, Congressman.\"Comments (211)Esther PerelPsychologistAt the heart of sustaining desire lies a challenge. It demands that we learn to reconcile our fundamental need for safety and security with our equally strong need for adventure and novelty.Comments (326)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile the media and many women\u0027s organizations focus on what is wrong with the lives of women executives (\"When you\u0027re a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"), a new generation of women leaders are focusing on what is right.Comments (20)Neal WootenWriter, artist and standup comedian; author, \u0027Reternity\u0027 and \u0027The Balance\u0027It amazes me how many of my dear friends in the South perceive this one sin as a conscious choice, but not the other 660-plus sins listed in the Bible. All anti-gay arguments are based solely on personal prejudice, and this is easy to prove.Comments (390)Caitlin FischWriter and personal chef2. You know the difference right away between his hurt cry and all the other ones, and only respond immediately to the former.Comments (55)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayI\u0027m a WWII veteran myself. I like that the men and women who served alongside me can visit the monument in their honor. But maybe a better tribute from our Tea Party politicians would be to step away from the cameras and end this shutdown that they themselves created.Comments (724)Morgan GuytonAssociate Pastor, Burke United Methodist ChurchOn the eve of our government shutdown, I wanted to do some research into the theological roots of Senator Ted Cruz, the standard-bearer of the Tea Party Republicans behind the shutdown.Comments (1,203)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostThe events are all examples of what should be the fundamental responsibility of society -- supporting and protecting its most fragile citizens -- and how we are failing miserably at the job.Comments (324)Jessica ProisEditor, HuffPost ImpactClinton has switched careers frequently, is a pragmatic idealist, wants a meaningful life and married the guy who left his hedge fund job to become a ski bum, instead of the Rhodes Scholar whom her father adored. She also said, \"I don\u0027t know\" to a question about her five-year plan. So is she a quintessential millennial?Comments (34)Arianna HuffingtonEverywhere we look, we see leaders with high IQs making terrible decisions -- government shutdown, anyone? -- burned out and unable to tap into their own wisdom. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here in Johannesburg to join a conversation among a group of 1,300 young leaders from all over the world who are every day solving problems in their communities.Comments (225)Claire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMany male protagonists seem palatable enough at first glance -- unless we hold them to the more exacting friendship standard.Comments (80)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorUnfortunately, curbing the worst excesses of an out-of-control military industrial complex is not a front burner issue for the 40 or so Tea Party Republicans currently stomping their feet in Congress about health care reform.Comments (195)Kirk DouglasActorWhen you get to be 96 years of age the road ahead is short, so you look back at the road you have traveled for almost 100 years. The first thing you come up against is technology.Comments (366)William BradleyPolitical AnalystAmerica is being judged by what\u0027s going on in the Washington clown show. The right-wing faction behind it is like the proverbial barking dog that catches the car -- no idea what to do now. And almost certainly no real grasp of the trouble it\u0027s causing.Comments (193)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesThrough her historic, 11-hour filibuster, State Senator Wendy Davis gave a voice to the millions of people who have felt shut out of the political process. The fact is, women in Texas are suffering. Texas women deserve better -- and Texas can do better.Comments (291)Jennifer GarnerActress; Save the Children Artist AmbassadorAsk my sisters, my mom friends, and certainly me, and we\u0027ll agree that raising kids is challenging under the best of circumstances. But having a close network of fellow parents to lean on and learn from, not to mention a supportive family, has made parenting easier for me. Meanwhile, in isolated, poverty-stricken communities across America, too many moms and dads face parenthood all alone.CommentsDavid ArquetteActor, Mentor, \"Dream School\"In a world full of self-appointed and uncertified judges who wildly swing gavels while pointing their proverbial fingers at anyone that doesn\u0027t fit in, sentencing them to humiliation and ridicule regardless of the fact that their only crime is that of individuality.Comments (12)Ros MxCartoonistCommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe shutdown is the story of the moment. But there are also other real things going on in the real world that have huge consequences for, yes, real people -- and the media shouldn\u0027t ignore those other stories.Comments (23)Alan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"As childish and petulant as House Republicans are behaving, the actions of Republican state legislators with regards to Obamacare is even worse, as they have the power to immediately improve millions of lives, but are stuck in their ideology and hatred.Comments (311)Lori BellUSAF veteran, Motivational Speaker, Inspirational Singer, Military SpousePreneur and momIn the heat of parenting, working, and creating a life together, what transitions a relationship from growing to thriving to long-term?CommentsThe Pet CollectiveYour daily source for cute, funny, informative, and heartwarming original videosIt was unsure if Thumper, a white kitten with black spots, would ever walk, but once he took his first step, there wasn\u0027t a dry eye in the room.CommentsVeer GidwaneyChief Executive Officer, Maxwell HealthUnless you\u0027ve been living under a rock, you know that this week marked the opening of state- and federal-run insurance marketplaces. While we don\u0027t know how they\u0027ll be regarded over time, initial reactions to them run the gamut from cynicism and uncertainty to measured optimism.Comments (12)Robert BrusteinPlaywright, director, actor, educator, theater founderH.L. Mencken used to rail again what he called the \"boobocracy\" of America, meaning a system accountable to majorities with little culture, humanity, or intelligence. I think it is time to haul this phrase out of the attic and apply it to our current political condition.Comments (87)Rick ModienWriterWhat accounts for the success of the twenty-one-year, monogamous relationship I\u0027ve shared with Chris, the love of my life and my soul mate? How have we been able to stay together for so long, and what is our secret?CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027It appears that Tunisians, like the Egyptians before them, have had enough of the Muslim Brotherhood party and want a change in direction in their country.CommentsElizabeth B. WydraChief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterWhile most Americans already think Congress is doing a bang up job preventing itself from solving the nation\u0027s problems, the Court will hear a case on the second day of its new Term that could make it even harder for Congress to address one particular issue: the corrupting influence of money in politics.Comments (41)Bill ChameidesDean, Duke University\u0027s Nicholas School of the EnvironmentFracking wastewater can contain massive amounts of brine (salts), toxic metals, and radioactivity. And so the gas companies have a problem: what to do with the stuff.Comments (35)Daylle Deanna SchwartzFounder, The Self-Love Movement; Author, Nice Girls Can Finish FirstI could almost hear him holding his breath, waiting for my response, and I think he let it out in a gasp when I said, \"Oh goody! I have some friends I\u0027d like to get together with, so I\u0027ll take advantage of having a free night.\"CommentsBrittany GibbonsBlogger, \"Brittany, Herself\"Six hours later, I peeled the moist scuba suit from my body and collapsed on the floor. Filling my lungs to capacity for the first time since being seated on the groom\u0027s side. It burns. It burns so good.Comments (114)Susan Buchanan, 2013. 5.10Peter Dreier, 2013. 5.10Mike Ryan, 2013. 5.10George Heymont, 2013. 5.10Fathom, 2013. 5.10MiniTime, 2013. 5.10Brett Wigdortz, 2013. 5.10Jose Graziano da Silva, 2013. 5.10V.
