{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027A Republican former secretary of state and a Democratic \"Jewish mother\" may have just given us the strongest case yet for the nuclear agreement with Iran. The first is a pillar of the \"realist\" camp in the American national security establishment. The second is a rising star in the Democratic Party from a heavily Jewish district in South Florida. Together, they represent key constituencies whose support for the historic accord is critical to isolating right-wing opponents and preventing last-minute sabotage attempts. Together, they also lay out a compelling narrative of why the agreement is so important to American national security.Dr. Michael Breus is a clinical psychologist and author of The Sleep Doctor\u0027s Diet Plan: Lose Weight Through Better Sleep. In answer to my questions, he shared his thoughts on the major obstacles to getting a good night\u0027s sleep, the steps you can take to improve your sleep, and the future of sleep technology.We know that government action can bring down the rate of maternal deaths because we see it happening everywhere around the world. Everywhere, that is, but here. We have a lot of catching up to do.President, National Organization for WomenThe Kim Davis situation raises interesting questions about the meaning and practical effect of the freedom of religion. Although, for reasons that I will explain, the issue today is one of public policy, rather than constitutional law, the evolution of constitutional principles in this realm is illuminating.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAs a member of the European Parliament, what bothers me most is that even now, with the biggest refugee crisis since WWII knocking on Europe\u0027s doors, the E.U. doesn\u0027t seem to be conscious of its magnitude. Worse still, it doesn\u0027t want to be conscious of it.Deputy of Podemos, and member of European ParliamentLabor Day is a time for honoring the working people of this country. It is a time to celebrate the accomplishments of the activists and organizers who fought for the 40-hour work week, occupational safety protection and other workplace rights. These working people resisted the oligarchs of their day, fought for a more responsive democracy, and built the middle class.U.S. Senator from VermontWhile the refugee and migrant crisis is an existential problem for Europe, it is also a huge opportunity. The way it is handled will critically impact not only the future of Europe, but also its identity -- the European ethos -- economics, demographics and indeed (don\u0027t be scared!) culture.Managing Director, Center for Transatlantic Relations (CTR), Johns Hopkins UniversityAt the end of this month, thousands of representatives from all over the world will gather in New York. They will witness the launch of the most ambitious universal effort since the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. It is a threshold moment.United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director, UN WomenThe news business has devolved into just another branch of the entertainment business. Many are well aware of this. Few, though, appreciate the degree to which even the elite media -- e.g., The New York Times -- contribute to the phenomenon.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAttacks on women\u0027s self-determination in body, mind and spirit are a staple of our political life because they work. Unless and until we confront the root reasons why patterns of violence against women work, both overt and covert violence against women will continue to be a political mainstay.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryThere are plenty of things wrong with the labor movement. It can be overly bureaucratic. There are corrupt officials in many unions. But there should be no doubt that the country is much better off as a result of the labor movement and prospects for progressive change would be brighter if it were stronger.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027No doubt, the bombastic Donald is an unlikely president. Yet what may be most extraordinary about his campaign is that on foreign policy, at least, he may be the most sensible Republican in the race.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteKentucky Clerk Kim Davis Becomes an Anti-Gay Martyr; Huckabee, Cruz and Eric Erickerick Rush to Davis\u0027 Defense; Rand Paul\u0027s App is Spying on You; Trump Attacks Jeb Bush for Speaking Spanish; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027A Romney candidacy will starkly reveal the problems the GOP faces in 2016, and they are much bigger than the mercurial Trump. The GOP has become the vehicle for a set of ideas that American voters will reject in the general election, no matter who is the standard bearer.Senior Fellow, DemosAmericans are looking to corporate citizens to embrace their responsibilities to workers and the public. The enormous popularity of minimum wage increases and anti-wage theft measures are a powerful barometer of this desire, and one that Uber and other sharing economy players would do well to heed.Partner in Union-Side Law Firm Bush, GottliebWhile many other sustainability challenges will remain, the tide of climate change will literally be reversed. This will free us to focus on other challenges such as the widespread use of toxic substances throughout our economy. There is a great deal riding on Jerry Brown and California\u0027s ambitious climate program.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteEvery year I speak to the families of new students at Wesleyan University just before they say goodbye and we start our semester. Having just dropped off my daughter (far from home) as she starts her first year in college, this was particularly poignant for me.President, Wesleyan UniversityThey have two things in common. Each state contains at least one city with a murder rate at least four times the national average -- Oakland, Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Newark; and each state is home to a Republican Presidential candidate: Fiorina, Carson, Kasich, Walker, Christie.Mike the Gun GuyThe Republican appropriations bills are stacked with ideological provisions known as \"riders\" that are unrelated to spending levels and weaken basic protections for workers, the backbone of our economy.Director of the Office of Management and BudgetI went on my first self-imposed diet at age 13. I was average in size and body shape, but I wanted to be skinny. The kind of skinny people commented upon; the kind of skinny that, in my mind, would make me special.There\u0027s no wrong way to be a woman.Europeans are facing an extraordinary challenge that inevitably elicits humanitarian, moral and ethical soul-searching, but also poses real political and security questions. I can only sympathize with them as they wrestle with this complex challenge.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateAfter in-depth interviews with 170 world leaders and classroom discussions with 6,000 executives and MBAs in Authentic Leadership Development (ALD) at Harvard Business School, we\u0027ve learned three essential steps to building your self-awareness.Senior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolAs we remember the legacy of this great thinker, let\u0027s also make sure to educate ourselves on the oppressive and profit-driven history of drug laws in this country and the obstacles that remain. It is a choice to either consent through silence or take action to end the drug war once and for all.Intern with the Drug Policy Alliance.Like other memorable images, the picture reminds us of what matters about the news. Sidestepping the intricate, often overwhelming detail that accompanies news stories, it targets what is important but lost sometimes in storytelling.Here\u0027s the question that must be asked: Why are we questioning Marissa Mayer\u0027s personal decision about how to balance her work and family lives when too few people have this option at all? The last time a male CEO was asked questions about how he would balance having a new baby and with work was never.Executive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgWith the growth of great women in TV and film, a whole lot of things actually pass this test. And, to take it a step further, there are a few shows and movies that don\u0027t have two male characters who talk to each other about something other than a woman. Here are 6 Netflix picks that turn gender bias on its head.Recent Graduate, Colby CollegeThe mounting catastrophe of Syrian refugees in Europe is one part the same old same old, \"not in my backyard,\" but with several new wrinkles.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The sobering truth of the matter is that Canada\u0027s refugee policy is not generous at all, neither compared to other countries today, nor compared to that most famous refugee destination historically, the Canada of the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.Writer, activist, J.D. candidate at Yale Law School.This widely reported \"official\" number overlooks the millions of people unemployed for more than a year, nor does it count those who are working part-time and looking for full-time work. The Department of Labor monthly report which includes people working part-time and looking for full-time work shows the real rate of unemployment.Law Professor, Loyola University New Orleans, CCR Associate Legal DirectorLast week, President Obama made the most extensive presidential visit to Alaska ever. He hiked on a glacier, met with Native Alaskans, and became the first president ever to visit the Arctic Circle. Throughout, he was calling attention to the real, on-the-ground effects of climate change.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubInstead of picnicking, Steelworkers in six states will spend this Labor Day picketing the gates of a dozen Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI) specialty mills. These 2,200 Steelworkers are not on strike. They never even took a strike vote to threaten a walkout. ATI locked them out of their jobs.International President, United SteelworkersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
