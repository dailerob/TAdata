{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Bestselling author of Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments and professor of finance at S P Jain School of Global ManagementThe financial crisis is behind us, right? Why would Wall Street shower Hillary Clinton with millions of dollars in speaking fees and tens of millions in campaign contributions? I think it is an insurance policy. Wall Street wants a friend in the White House to protect the status quo, and if they can\u0027t get a Republican elected, Hillary is the next best thing. I think they need a friend in government because the industry could not survive an investigation into how they actually make their profits. Wall Street doesn\u0027t want you to know how they make their money.

But he also deserves to get some help.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIf he were here today, the martyred Dr. King would surely be shaking his head that America still has a problem with peaceful dissenters of conscience.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyTed Cruz\u0027s position on net neutrality is so full of whoppers that it has to be taken apart, sentence by sentence, to fully demonstrate the depth of his dishonesty.Senior Director of Strategy, Free Press and Free Press Action FundSix years ago this week, the U.S. Supreme Court created a Wild West of campaign finance regulations. With their decision in Citizens United, five justices set the stage for a flood of secret special interest money trying to buy elections nationwide.I believe that genius is made of three important ingredients: creative impulse, hard work and careful study.

The hurt and desperation I thought I might be able to share with someone. I recall feeling complete dismay that others couldn\u0027t see how this loss to me felt like grieving an actual death.Writer, poet, traveler, optimist, enthusiast for life.I\u0027m glad Palin spoke up. I\u0027m glad that she\u0027s passionate about the lack of care our vets get when they come home. I\u0027m glad that she used her spotlight to go off script and use her annoyingly shrill voice to raise awareness of a serious issue that\u0027s been plaguing this country for over a century.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.samuel-warde.com.Just 53 men and 9 women have as much wealth as more than 3.6 billion people on this planet. Such a startling statistic highlights how extreme inequality has picked up a dramatic pace.President, Oxfam AmericaFlint is a view into our tomorrows and we cannot fail to fix it and get it right. The population is animated and angry and there has to be collaboration between government entities or we will see the acceleration of a larger national deterioration.Best selling author, TV political analyst, communications and public relations expertIf the predictions are correct -- if Planet 9 actually exists -- then our solar system will better comport with many of those we find elsewhere. And if our solar system is not so special, then there\u0027s added reason to suspect that the biology it has spawned may not be so unusual either.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteI have no kids.

Sure, ISIS is scary (that\u0027s their goal), and al Qaeda is violent and intently inhumane, but we don\u0027t need to paint all Salafis with that broad jihadi brush.Born fundamentalist, raised Evangelical, seminary trained, now Mainline Protestant \u0026 a PhD candidate studying Islam at a Catholic universityHillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, should be singled out as furthering white supremacy and privilege. Someone needs to define white supremacy, if indeed accepting money from prison lobbyists isn\u0027t an egregious example of privilege and supremacy.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comThe civic minds of the people are sidelined by the monetized minds of a corrupted commercial media, political consultants, pundits and the purveyors of an ever-more dictatorial corporate state.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAs I type this, with trembling hands and tears in my eyes, I know that this is not the way Leila would want any of us to remember her.
