{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington PostThe bracing reality that America has two sets of rules -- one for the corporate class and another for the middle class -- has never been more indisputable. One of the most glaring examples of this double standard continues to be the ability of corporations to cheat the public out of tens of billions of dollars a year by using offshore tax havens -- leaving the rest of us to pick up the tab. And with cash-strapped states all across the country cutting vital services to the bone, it\u0027s not like we don\u0027t need the money. According to the GAO, 83 of the 100 largest publicly-traded companies in the country have subsidiaries in tax havens -- or, as the corporate class comically calls them, \"financial privacy jurisdictions.\" Even more egregiously, of those 83 companies, 74 received government contracts. Blood boiling yet?Read Post | CommentsLeo Hindery, Jr., 06.01.2010Chairman, U.S. Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America FoundationWe as a nation are tolerating very selfish behaviors that hurt our workers, trade balance and the national security of our country, mostly because leaders in Washington are too deferential to big finance and multinational corporations.Read Post | CommentsBradley Burston, 06.01.2010Columnist for Haaretz and Senior Editor, haaretz.comHere in Israel, we have still yet to learn the lesson: We are no longer defending Israel. We are now defending the siege of Gaza. The siege itself is becoming Israel\u0027s Vietnam.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 06.01.2010Consultant, Writer, Policy AnalystThe DoJ announced last week that there would be no indictments in the collapse of AIG. Nobody\u0027s guilty? That\u0027s getting it backward. It\u0027s like Murder On the Orient Express: They all did it. But we\u0027re the only ones who are going to pay for it.Read Post | CommentsMark Penn, 06.01.2010CEO, Burson-MarstellerOn the BP crisis, Obama needs to get away from the posturing politicians and get together with scientists. Making the solution the Administration\u0027s responsibility is risky, but no more dangerous than ongoing inaction -- just ask Jimmy Carter.Read Post | CommentsLinda Bergthold, 06.01.2010Health policy consultantOne of the major accusations against Obama\u0027s nominee to head up the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Dr. Donald Berwick, is that he \"loves\" Britain\u0027s National Health Service. Ergo, he loves socialism, ergo he is a Marxist.Read Post | CommentsDennis A. Henigan, 06.01.2010Brady Center Vice President and Author of \"Lethal Logic\"If Chicago\u0027s law is struck down, it will no doubt be hailed by the NRA as a great victory, as was Heller. But the most ardent \"gun rights\" advocates can barely hide their disappointment with the practical impact.Read Post | CommentsDon McNay, 06.01.2010Award winning financial columnist and structured settlement guruGary Rivlan notes in his book, Broke USA, \"the working poor have become big business.\" You wouldn\u0027t think that poor people would be a growth market, but businesses make big money off people who live paycheck to paycheck.Read Post | CommentsThomas Pickering, Trita Parsi and David Kay, 06.01.2010The UN Security Council should take advantage of the Turkey/Brazil-Iran nuclear deal and use it as an opportunity for the first step in a broader dialogue that could include further confidence building measures.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 06.01.2010Author Joe McGinniss has moved next door to Palin as part of an extreme effort to research the Palins for a book. Would it be OK if the Palin\u0027s just straight up killed Joe McGinniss in self-defense?Read Post | Comments (3,973)Lorelei Kelly, 06.01.2010Director, New Strategic Security InitiativeTea partiers and residents of the Gulf Coast take note: could it be that we\u0027ve so scorned and dismantled our government that the only loved and well-functioning institution left is the military?Read Post | CommentsMichael Brenner, 06.01.2010Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic RelationsThe President made diplomacy the theme of the national security strategy he laid out at West Point last month. But a brave new world grounded in multilateralism is still on the far horizon.Read Post | CommentsDave Johnson, 06.01.2010Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe propaganda campaign falsely claiming that Obama is to blame for America\u0027s massive deficit is to be expected from the right: it\u0027s what they do. But why has this campaign gone unanswered?Read Post | CommentsRobert Mackey, 06.01.2010Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)Just like most of you, I\u0027ve been spending the last day just watching videos and reading spin from all sides. Here\u0027s my 50 cents on the whole mess (and it is a mess, a mess of Israel\u0027s making): this is going to damage Israel badly.Read Post | CommentsTom Engelhardt, 06.01.2010Editor of TomDispatch.comWho can deny that our American world is in trouble? I was born in a country that thought it could rebuild anything. You\u0027re living in one lacking recuperative powers.Read Post | CommentsDavid Stark, 06.01.2010President and Creative Director of David Stark Design and ProductionRead Post | CommentsAlan Dershowitz, 06.01.2010The international community has once again ganged up on Israel. In doing so, Israel\u0027s critics have failed to pinpoint precisely what Israel did that allegedly violates international law.Read Post | CommentsMickey Bergman, 06.01.2010Founder and President of the Solel Strategic Group; Fmr. IDF officerWhere is Israel\u0027s political leadership that is brave enough to stand up and make the nuanced argument on why this was not about the individual soldiers\u0027 behavior, but about the decisions that sent them on a bad mission.Read Post | CommentsJames Zogby, 06.01.2010President of the Arab American Institute, Author of Arab Voices (Palgrave Macmillan 10/10)What should the US do with Israel? If they are a friend and an ally we value, we tell them the truth. Tell them that their behavior is unacceptable and is only making the world more dangerous for us all.Read Post | CommentsNathan Gardels, 06.01.2010Editor, NPQ, Global Services of Los Angeles Times Syndicate/Tribune MediaJust as China did to North Korea, the Obama administration last week signaled to its long-standing Israeli ally that America\u0027s other interests must trump Israel\u0027s when their strategic goals conflict.Read Post | CommentsRev. Jesse Jackson, 06.01.2010Civil rights activistThe BP oil disaster in the Gulf Coast is now the most massive spill in world history. The negative impact of oil refining operations is being felt not just along the Gulf Coast, but in Whiting, Indiana as well.Read Post | CommentsMichael Kieschnick, 06.01.2010President of CREDO MobileThere is only one international voice that has influence in Israel and that is the United States. The same ships that brought relief to Haiti can bring food and medical supplies to Gaza.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 06.01.2010Film Critic and Pundit for Salon, Huffington Post, and Mendelson\u0027s MemosIt may be a doozy of a stand-alone dramatic scene, but last week\u0027s verbal tongue-lashing on Glee from Kurt\u0027s father to Finn was not the proud moment in gay/straight relations that it has been sold as.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 06.01.2010I was deeply saddened at the outcome of the so-called \"peace\" flotilla, which turned out to contain a large contingent of violent thugs whose only interest it was to provoke Israel.Read Post | CommentsKen Levine, 06.01.2010Emmy-Winning Writer/Director/Producer, MLB AnnouncerI should replace Simon Cowell on American Idol. I mentioned this on Twitter and Facebook and got an unbelievably positive response. Three, maybe four people at least. So I\u0027ve decided to really go for it.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 05.31.2010Co-founder and co-editor of The American ProspectWhat do the oil catastrophe and the Wall Street collapse have in common? In both cases, a powerful, politically protected industry invented something that could not easily be repaired when it broke.Read Post | CommentsHuffPost TV, 2010.06.01Alexandra Juhasz, 2010.06.01Caroline Dowd-Higgins, 2010.06.01Dan Solin, 2010.06.01Don McNay, 2010.06.01Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 2010.06.01Elizabeth Cunningham, 2010.06.01Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2010.06.01Matt J.
