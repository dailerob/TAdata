{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"In her new book, Laurie David talks about how family dinners offer a great opportunity for meaningful discussions about the day\u0027s news. I couldn\u0027t agree more. So HuffPost is launching a new feature: HuffPost Family Dinner Downloads. Every Friday, our editors will highlight a news story sure to spark a lively discussion among the whole family. Growing up in Athens, my home life was centered around family meals. My mother kept our table filled with a never-ending array of food. Just as endless were the conversations we\u0027d have while seated at the kitchen table -- it\u0027s where my views of the world began to be formed. Something magical happens when you are talking over a meal. Your whole body relaxes. The food has a truth serum effect. Things come up that wouldn\u0027t have anywhere else. So gather your family around the laptop, smartphone, or iPad and check out our first Family Dinner Download.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 11.05.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s a little ironic that Harry Reid\u0027s keeping his majority leader role while Pelosi\u0027s losing hers.

Borosage, 11.05.2010President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe whole notion that you attract independents by moving to a mythical \"center,\" by lowering your sights, trimming your sails, and tacking to prevailing winds needs another look.Read Post | CommentsJames K. Galbraith, 11.05.2010Economist, AuthorThe original sin of Obama\u0027s presidency was to assign economic policy to a closed circle of bank-friendly economists and Bush carryovers. Larry Summers.
