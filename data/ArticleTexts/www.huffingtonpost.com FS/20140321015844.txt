{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Will BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027In the last few months, though, we\u0027ve seen something truly amazing happen. The 1 percent is in \"they fight you\" mode, in some of the crudest terms possible. They are attacking the movement for equity in the country, and -- at least rhetorically, for now -- they want to burn it. You should draw your own conclusions as to what comes next. Just this week, we saw the latest fighting words from the billionaire class -- and the second time that folks staging legal, peaceful and democratic protests for things like a higher minimum wage, and protecting the safety net for those still reeling from an economic crisis triggered in 2008 by the billionaire class, have been compared to Nazis.Comments (255)Arthur Chu\u0027Jeopardy!\u0027 champion, voice-over artist, actor, comedianI was, in short, famous. A celebrity. At the apex of my Warholian 15 minutes. And I\u0027m still not sure how the hell it happened.Comments (59)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI once suggested to my visiting 80-year-old aunt that we could spend the afternoon together shopping. \u0027Why?\u0027 she asked me, \u0027I don\u0027t need anything.\u0027 It was a generational disconnect of the first degree.Comments (25)Paul ReiserActor, writer and stand-up comedianDave Brenner was in our living room with remarkable regularity, a saturation level I\u0027ve never seen equaled since. He was a guest on the Tonight Show, he hosted the Tonight Show, he was on Merv Grif?n, he was on Mike Douglas (for weeks at a time), he was on game shows... and, it seemed to me, always with new material. That kind of proli?c consistency takes a lot of hard work and dedication -- something I sensed would hit home with my dad.CommentsPhilip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America\u0027The problem here is not just that people are discouraged from self-determination. Modern society is organized to avoid human choice. Ever-more-detailed rules are designed to prevent people from acting on their own sense of right and wrong.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI grieve for Fred Phelps. The man spent a great portion of his time on earth using his gifts in such a hurtful, and ultimately silly way. But I won\u0027t picket his funeral. I won\u0027t dance on his grave. I will try not to emulate him in any way.Comments (15)Yulia TymoshenkoFmr. prime minister of Ukraine; Current leader of All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" (\"Batkivshchyna\")I feel sorry for the people of Russia. They are being led into a totalitarian abyss of economic and spiritual collapse which goes hand-in-hand with poverty and devastation. Using degrading and immoral means, the Russian government has destroyed the notion of truth with their mad propaganda for the occupation of Ukraine.Comments (415)Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostRight now is a terrific time to buy a house in many parts of the U.S. -- if you have outstanding credit and a suitcase full of cash. For most everyone else, the market is increasingly out of reach. Here are four reasons why.Comments (390)Mudit KakkarEngineer, analyst, writerGoogle one upped all its rivals, all in one fell swoop. Offhand, it\u0027s rash to say that Google is winning the race. To better discern the tussle within the Valley, many files need to be decoded.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe very first thing we all need to do today is thank the LGBT Pride committee in New York City for letting Bill Donohue march in the parade. And the second thing we all need to do, later on in the day, is buy ourselves or someone else a cold Guinness.Comments (16)Nina KalandadzeDirector of Internal Communications at Union Theological SeminaryRussians still consider Ukraine part of Russia. Seeing their neighbor succeed where they have failed would undermine Putin\u0027s political stranglehold and energize the Russian people to seek a better future with real democratic reform.CommentsMichael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027If the world keeps burning fossil fuels at the current rate, it will cross a threshold into environmental ruin by 2036. The \"faux pause\" could buy the planet a few extra years beyond that date to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the crossover -- but only a few.Comments (343)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterNo, it is not suddenly good to eat more saturated fat -- and the new study grabbing headlines showed no such thing. The study, a meta-analysis in the Annals of Internal Medicine, shows the following two things in particular: (1) you cannot get a good answer to a bad question; and (2) there is more than one way to eat badly.CommentsRobert ScobleStartup Liaison for RackspaceLarry Page is on stage at TED right now. I\u0027m at home watching. He is not wearing Google Glass. This fits the new narrative that\u0027s going on in my head: that Google doesn\u0027t know how to stick with a product.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Since 2001 Sam Nunn has served as Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and since 1999 he has chaired the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u0027 board of trustees. He sits on the steering committee of the \"Fix the Debt\" campaign led by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson.CommentsJames Michael SamaWriter, actor, public speakerHere are some myths being perpetuated in our society that stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of what a relationship really is. Unfortunately, people may have had these experiences more than once, and begin to express their opinions as overall fact.CommentsGayatri Devi, M.D.Neurologist and Director of the New York Memory ServicesYour Buddha Nerve, better known as the vagus, is your body\u0027s built-in mechanism for thriving and for maintaining good health. So how do you turn it on?CommentsJeremy HelligarFreelance journalist, blogger, author, ‘Is It True What They Say about Black Men?’Ever since Will \u0026 Grace set a new standard for relationships between gay men and straight women by suggesting that our straight-female BFFs must be No. 1 in our lives, I\u0027ve noticed an international trend of straight women increasingly dominating gay nightlife too.CommentsChris BoeskoolBlogs at theboeskool.com about Jesus, politics, and bathroom humorI believe the only right and rational response to a man who spends his whole life carrying around signs (literal or figurative) that say \"God Hates You\" is to proclaim to the world, with our words and our life, that \"God Loves You!\"Comments (13)Toni Nagywriter, podcaster, tonibologna.com, overshareshow.comAdults are often looking for a way to check out. Is being slightly spacey because you rolled a joint any worse than staring at your phone the entire afternoon when at the park with your kid?Comments (22)John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusI\u0027ve argued against the extreme critique of U.S. policy in Ukraine, one that the Russian foreign ministry regularly trumpets and a small but vocal sliver of the left has embarrassingly embraced. The question remains: Should the United States have been involved in Ukraine at any level?CommentsTom KirdahyProducer and attorneyI remember a time when the first thing anyone in the LGBT community did in the morning was read the obituaries to find out who we had lost the day before. Today, we go straight to the Styles Section to see who got hitched.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgAmericans understand how expensive dental care has become, which partially explains why only 36 percent of all adults in the United States are expected to visit a dentist this year -- and why, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, one in four nonelderly Americans have untreated tooth decay.Comments (21)Natasha CraigWife, Mother and BloggerIt was now our family, our home, our decisions. It\u0027s funny though, because the moment \"I\" became a \"we\" I realized what it really meant to be happy.CommentsKweku MandelaPresident, Out of Africa Entertainment; Co-Founder, Africa Rising FoundationMy grandfather would always say that if we as humans don\u0027t transcend this cycle of hatred and violence that we find ourselves in so often, we\u0027ll always be prisoners.CommentsLindsay HolmesAssociate Editor, GPS for the Soul, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s my belief that the point of \"unplugging movement\" isn\u0027t to completely tear us away from our devices -- in fact, it\u0027s quite the opposite. The point of disconnecting from our devices and reconnecting to the world around us is to remind us that there is a world outside of our screens -- and as a result, there\u0027s a way to come back to them and use them in a more mindful manner.CommentsSusan KrausTherapist, mediator, travel writerRebecca Barrett-Fox, Ph.D., spent years studying the Westboro Baptist Church. With all the intense speculation and conjecture on what is going on with the WBC, I sought her out to get a more informed and balanced perspective.CommentsDavid Sack, M.D.The laws against drunk driving are fairly clear. Most people know the dangers and have seen the campaigns warning the public of the consequences. But what about bicycling under the influence?CommentsSec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesYou might have to wait a few more days to see your team play, but don\u0027t wait to sign up for coverage because open enrollment ends on March 31.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorJoseph teaches at Tufts University and also founded a growing subfield that he characterizes as \"Black Power Studies,\" which is actively rewriting post-war American and African American history and related interdisciplinary fields.CommentsJoseph A. DominoAdjunct professorFor those unfamiliar with the term \"adjunct,\" it is considered a part-time supplemental teaching position. To virtually earn somewhere between $10-13 an hour for performing college-level instruction speaks plainly of the Walmartization of our nation\u0027s colleges and universities.Comments (31)Abigail Perdue, 2014.20.03Jeff Ritterman, MD, 2014.20.03Kevin Lankes, 2014.20.03Paul Reiser, 2014.20.03Nathan Manske, 2014.20.03Charlotte Robinson, 2014.20.03Omar Sarwar, 2014.20.03Dean Baker, 2014.20.03Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2014.20.03Robert Weiss, 2014.20.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"WE CAN DO THIS TWO WAYS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
