{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPAPAPAgain and again, President Bush has insisted that he\u0027s running the war by listening to his military commanders. But that\u0027s clearly not what\u0027s happening. For months, those commanders, Gen. Abizaid and Gen. Casey, have been unwavering in their opposition to sending more troops to Iraq, but the surge is moving forward anyway. Making matters worse, the generals are now providing cover for Bush by caving to White House pressure and acting like they support the move. If there were ever a time for America\u0027s military leaders to tell us the truth as opposed to keeping their mouths shut while waiting for this administration\u0027s version of the gold watch -- the Medal of Freedom bestowed on those that play the good soldier and go along with the program -- this is surely that time.READ POST | comments (28)12.27.2006 Murray WaasWhether pardoning Nixon was the right or wrong thing to do, or smart or dumb, there was no doubt that Ford himself did so because he thought it was the moral and necessary thing to do for his country.READ POST | comments12.27.2006 Harry ShearerSo the United States had to be saved from the trauma of watching Nixon and his men lie under oath.

It was Chevy Chase\u0027s portrayal of Ford on SNL as a bumbling, fumbling clown that had as much to do with his defeat as anything else.READ POST | comments (20)12.27.2006 Robert ScheerMany critics of the war suggest that the U.S. remains in Iraq because it wants that nation\u0027s petroleum. But oil is not the primary reason. Instead, look to the military-industrial complex.READ POST | comments (25)12.27.2006 Mark Weisbrot and Robert NaimanAs the Bush Administration has become more open about its support for the Ethiopian invasion, U.S. press criticism appears to have become muted somewhat.READ POST | comments12.27.2006 Jeff McIntire-StrasburgThere\u0027s no better time than the turning of the calendar to commit your self to a greener, more climate-friendly lifestyle.READ POST | comments12.27.2006 Huff TVHuffPost\u0027s Melinda Henneberger joined Jonathan Karl and George Will as part of the roundtable on This Week with George Stephanopoulos to discuss the politics of escalation in Iraq, and Virgil Goode.READ POST | comments12.27.2006 Wade DavisOn Sept. 11, 2001, in the most successful act of asymmetric warfare since the Trojan horse, the world came home to America. \"Why do they hate us?\" asked Bush.
