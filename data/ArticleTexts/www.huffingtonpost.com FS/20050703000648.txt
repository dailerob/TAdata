{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"07.01.2005 Arianna HuffingtonIt’s a jam-packed show this week as Tim is joined by Arlen Spector and Pat Leahy to discuss the implications of the O\u0027Connor retirement, and Chris Dodd, Chuck Hagel and Duncan Hunter to talk about Iraq -- because, as the Meet the Press website puts it, \"the war in Iraq still dominates the hearts and minds of the American public\". Hey, thanks for noticing… Here are two of the questions I\u0027d like to hear Russert ask his guests:\"Sen. Hagel, at the end of last month, you said, \u0027The White House is completely disconnected from reality. It\u0027s like they\u0027re just making it up as they go along.\u0027 Since then, Don Rumsfeld has defended the progress of the war in front of the Senate and the President has tried to convince the nation that the war in Iraq is connected to what happened on 9/11. What is it going to take before this administration starts leveling with the American people?\"\"Rep. Hunter, you\u0027ve been a very vocal defender of the treatment prisoners in Guatanamo Bay receive, arguing that their menu includes items such as oven-fried chicken, rice pilaf, and pita bread, and that \u0027the average inmate in Guantanamo has gained five to seven pounds last year.\u0027 My question: Isn\u0027t it possible to feed a man rice pilaf and still subject him to torture?”read whole post | permalink | comments07.02.2005 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellI revealed in yesterday\u0027s taping of the McLaughlin Group that Time magazine\u0027s emails will reveal that Karl Rove was Matt Cooper\u0027s source. I have known this for months but didn\u0027t want to say it at a time that would risk me getting dragged into the grand jury. Since I revealed the big scoop, I have had it reconfirmed by yet another highly authoritative source. Too many people know this. It should break wide open this week. I know Newsweek is working on an \u0027It\u0027s Rove!\u0027 story and will probably break it tomorrow.read whole post | permalink | comments07.02.2005 Gara LaMarcheThe unexpected retirement of Justice O\u0027Connor fills many of us with dread. Who would have thought, when this conservative Arizona jurist was appointed by Reagan nearly a quarter-century ago, that she would come to be one of the last lines of defense against extremist government? As has been endlessly noted in the last 24 hours, this Justice has held the balance of power on many key issues before the Supreme Court, and therefore the country, tipping it our way (affirmative action) sometimes and their way (Bush v. Gore) other times. It shouldn\u0027t be that way, in a balanced, well-functioning democracy, but we are dangerously close to it.read whole post | permalink | comments07.02.2005 Jay RosenIn an presidential election, we at least have a theory. The voters are the target, the messages are designed to frighten or outrage or motivate them, and if it works more voters will on election day pick your guy. Political choice and the media campaign connect in a way we can roughly grasp. In the Supreme Court selection, the voters will again be the target, the messages will again be designed to frighten or outrage or motivate them, and if it works... then what? What is the person successfully frightened, outraged or motivated in Peoria supposed to do? Call Arlen Specter\u0027s office with demands? He doesn\u0027t even represent Peoria!read whole post | permalink | comments07.02.2005 Earl Ofari HutchinsonThe Mexican government’s sale of the racially offensive cartoon character Memin Pinguin as a commemorative stamp is an outrageous sign that top Mexican officials still refuse to deal with the country’s racism. But it’s just that a sign. Racism goes much deeper in the country. Even while Mexican writers and politicians rail in articles against American racism, many Mexicans are quick to boast of differences in skin color among their own family members.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Sarah StillmanI arrived home from a week in Caracas, Venezuela just in time to catch the latest episode of the Manifest Destiny Variety Show, starring George “The Liberator” Bush and his much-anticipated plans for renewal in Iraq. And let me tell you, it was a mammoth relief to sit down in my air-conditioned TV room at 8 pm and discover that my Commander-in-Chief hasn\u0027t missed a beat in the War on Terror. Because for a second there, the men and women I met during my time in Caracas came pretty close to convincing me otherwise.read whole post | permalink | comments07.02.2005 David Corn\"Who\u0027s in charge of America?\" That was my nearly-six-year-old asking me this question. \"What do you mean?\" I inquired. \"Well, who\u0027s in charge of America in Takoma Park?\" She was referring to our town, which borders Washington, DC, in Maryland. I still was wondering what she had in mind, and I\u0027ve learned as a parent not to give answers until I fully understand the question and -- just as important -- why it is being asked. \"Why do you want to know?\" I said. \"I want to make a birthday card for America,\" she said.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Paul FeigAnybody see the footage of that truck that crashed through the fence at an airport and sped up and down a runway past taxiing jetliners? It\u0027s a good thing they put our hard-earned cash into getting my nail clippers away from me for the past three years instead of doing something silly like reinforcing the fences around runways where planes loaded with passengers and jet fuel are idling. Now THAT\u0027S homeland security!read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Hooman MajdWhen the planes hit the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, I knew it wasn\u0027t the work of another McVeigh. It had to be the work of professionals, and the only professionals I knew who could or would pull off something like this were Moslem. As George Bush has said, Moslems are a talented people. And Moslems were now going to pay. On the morning of September 11th, 2001, I sat in my apartment less than a mile away from the WTC, shocked like the rest of us but also realizing that I was about to become a wog again.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Michelle PileckiDoes the blogosphere deserve the credit for pushing the Downing Street Memos story into the newscasts and pages of the national media? Yes and no, according to a nicely sourced account in the American Journalism Review, which details how and -- more to the point -- why so many in the media were so slow to cover it.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Russell ShawYes, the swing-state Nader voters in 2000 set the stage for the election of an anti-choice leader who won\u0027t make the same mistake as his Dad, and nominate a closet liberal like Justice Souter. Your reproductive freedom may rest in whatever arrows lie in the meager quiver of Senate Democrats, and, I must point out on the hope that no more pro-choice Justices leave the Court before the 2006 mid-term elections. Until then, the reproductive freedom of American women may well rest with a few \"moderate Republican\" U.S. Senators, and with the medical skills of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u0027s oncologist.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Cenk UygurNow that Sandra Day O’Connor has announced her resignation, the conservatives and liberals will come out with guns blazing. The conservatives will try to get Bush to nominate someone who has an extreme right-wing agenda. The liberals will counter their every move. There promises to be a huge battle filled with filibusters and bunker busters. Before we all go nuclear, how about a reasonable compromise – a justice just like Sandra Day O’Connor.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Alan DershowitzIt\u0027s interesting how quickly the bigots -- Jews and non-Jews alike -- crawl out from under their rocks as soon as Israel is mentioned. (See the comments to my previous post on Norman Finkelstein.) The newest form of bigotry is to claim that I and others who generally support Israel argue that \"anyone who criticizes Israel is an anti-Semite.\" This is a bald-faced lie.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 James BoyceOn Wednesday, July 5th, 1965, LBJ is speaking with Martin Luther King, Jr. who just three days before had spoken out against the war, \"I\u0027m not going to sit buy and see war escalated without saying anything about it,\" King had told a rally in Virginia, \"the Vietnam War must be stopped.\" King was worried that LBJ would be upset. But Johnson was kind, \"I think you have a duty, as a minister and as leader of millions of people, to give them a sense of purpose and direction...I\u0027ve lost about 264 lives up to now and I could lose 265,000 mighty easy.\" That last sentence stopped me cold.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Thomas de ZengotitaYou know that standing and raising one hand as if to testify gesture? And the standing and raising both arms so that grace can pour down on you gesture? That was happening all around me, but—sorry to go to the obvious—the mood was EXACTLY like a rock concert. People would do that for a while and then sit down and make a cell phone call, or eat a sandwich, or do a thumbs up to some acquaintance across the way. In terms of body language, I couldn\u0027t tell the difference between the people heading toward the Altar/Screen and the people heading for the subway.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Carl PopeJustice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor\u0027s resignation this morning puts at risk the commonsense, conservative trend that I noted earlier this week in my blog. O\u0027Connor was one of the key swing votes on the Court, which in recent months has handed reactionary legal hit squads such as the Pacific Legal Foundation a series of reminders that the Constitution allows Congress to act on behalf of the general welfare.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Rep. Ted PoeFifteen friends and I traveled to the tropics this past weekend on last-minute notice. We flew from the Washington, D.C. area to a remote island in the Caribbean. While not all of the “suites” had air-conditioning, the accommodations had a fresh newness about them and some of the rooms enjoyed waterfront views. The “rooms” are well-kept. There are no Gideon bibles in the night stand drawers, but each has a Koran, which the “hired help” is not permitted to touch with rare exceptions, when they must wear gloves.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 James FallowsSo Time Inc\u0027s Norman Pearlstein says he will turn over Matthew Cooper\u0027s notes, because Time magazine is \"not above the law.\" C\u0027mon. Being \"above the law\" would mean not doing what the law specified -- and refusing to accept any of the consequences for that decision. Matt Cooper, Judith Miller, and the New York Times have been saying something completely different. They have been saying that there is a conflict between what the law asks and what their professional values allow them to do. Therefore they will take the consequences. They will go to jail.read whole post | permalink | comments06.30.2005 Joseph NyePolls show that President Bush\u0027s speech on Iraq did little to bolster his slipping support. Describing the war in Iraq as the latest battle in the war on terrorism rather than a diversion is less convincing than ever. And whatever one\u0027s view about our entry into the war, we are all stuck with the disastrous results of the ideological blindness and sheer incompetence of Donald Rumsfeld and his colleagues. Pep talks about \"staying the course\" will no longer suffice.permalink | comments07.01.2005 Harry ShearerBlair now returns, with the WMD and connection-to-terrorism arguments in tatters, to a golden oldie as the Real Reason (no relation to OJ’s Real Killers): After Sept. 11, he told the AP in an interview, it was necessary to \"draw a line in the sand here, and the country to do it with was Iraq because they were in breach of U.N. resolutions going back over many years.\" Try this little test: check out which countries have defied the most U.N. resolutions, an exercise I performed in the leadup to the war. The answers, as of late 2002: Israel and Turkey.read whole post | permalink | comments07.01.2005 Andrei ChernyWe devote ourselves to testing which populistish Democrat can raise the most rabble, throw out the most red meat, and criticize the Republicans in the most vicious manner. We devote ourselves to providing the American people with exhaustive itemizations of Republicans’ voluminous missteps and mistakes. And when Americans still don’t hear our “message” we emulate a Bermuda shorts-clad tourist looking for directions to the Champs Elysees: we speak LOUDER and sloooower.permalink | comments07.01.2005 Paul RieckhoffThere is this portrayal of the Soldier as \u0027our troops\u0027 - some super-special individual with almost magic abilities and a separate set of needs and concerns about life. The Army doesn\u0027t just need \"those watching tonight who are considering a military career\" as Mr. Bush said. It needs the average citizen to step up. It needs the inner city youth and country boy. It needs the slackers and the young conservatives. It needs the kids in college to put that on hold for a couple of years and enlist.read whole post | permalink | commentsHuff Post values your privacy.
