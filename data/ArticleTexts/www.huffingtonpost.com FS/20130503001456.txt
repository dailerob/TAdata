{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostUnder steady attack after their seminal research was found to be riddled with errors, Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff are making a show of backing away from the austerity that their research encouraged. They claim that their views on austerity have never changed, but the record tells a different story. They\u0027re still trying to have it both ways -- advocating for government belt-tightening while trying to avoid being seen as political. For those readers who have spent the past month held prisoner by the Sleestaks from \"The Land Of The Lost,\" let me catch you up.Comments (2,672)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowFox News Channel amplified its crusade against the president this week, implying that the same administration that killed Bin Laden and much of al Qaeda\u0027s leadership is apparently composed of terrorist sympathizers.Comments (133)Chris KluweNFL player, Minnesota VikingsWhy do I speak out in support of the gay community? Because the words, \"We should round them all up and send them to an island to die,\" are absolutely abhorrent to any rational-minded person and should never be uttered by one member of the human race about another.Comments (351)Emily PeckManaging Editor, HuffPost BusinessThe daughter of one of the world\u0027s most shameless bankers has apparently discovered the secret shame of all working women everywhere.Comments (443)Ben AffleckAcademy Award-winning producer and writerAs a nation we both claim a noble position in the world and assert a reputation for fostering freedom, human rights and fairness here and abroad. If indeed we are to live up to that, we cannot abide having some among us who starve.Comments (402)Kelly M. FlanaganClinical PsychologistI don\u0027t care if he doesn\u0027t follow his wallet -- as long as he follows his heart and it always leads him back to you. I don\u0027t care if he is strong -- as long as he gives you the space to exercise the strength that is in your heart.Comments (140)Mark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVBillions of dollars are being invested to make trading without humans faster, cheaper, smarter. The problem is that no matter how smart you make machines, they will never be smart enough in our lifetime to detect all levels of deceit and fraud. Particularly online.Comments (20)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50There are common language mistakes that provoke the same response in me as fingernails on a blackboard. Here are just three of them. Feel free to add your own pet peeves in comments.Comments (3,211)Will SelfWill Self is a novelist, journalist and RAPt supporterYou don\u0027t need to have suffered from addictive illness (although it undoubtedly helps) to understand that abstinence-based recovery is the only method that really works.CommentsDr. Judith RodinPresident of the Rockefeller FoundationThere is still no machine that can match the power of human ingenuity to solve truly human problems. And therefore, \"backing brains\" has always been a key part of philanthropy\u0027s strategy.CommentsRobert Jay LiftonAuthor; PsychiatristDrones have entered our consciousness. Suddenly they seem to be everywhere. Therefore, it is time to have a conversation about our relationship as human beings to these robotic objects as weapons.Comments (36)David WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027I had the honor of meeting the great George Jones only once, but it was one of the most amazing and surprising moments of my professional life.Comments (20)Chris KresserAuthor, Personal Paleo CodeFor more than half a century we were told that red meat and eggs are bad for us because they raise our cholesterol, only to find that the evidence supporting this hypothesis is weak at best. Let\u0027s not make TMAO the new cholesterol.Comments (66)Dr. Wendy WalshCohost, \"The Doctors\"; CNN human behavior expertMy mission: to help single women compete for a narrowing market of men who will make a commitment in a high-supply sexual economy. Here are 9 reasons we should not be touching tender things on a first date.Comments (204)The Amazing KreskinWith a showman\u0027s flair, a comedian\u0027s wit, and capacities of a bona fide Mentalist...I\u0027ve given a lot of thought to what I\u0027m going to talk to you about right now given the gravity of the most recent prediction I have been preparing to reveal. These are not logical things I\u0027m going to say, but things that I feel very, very strongly about.CommentsBrit MorinFounder and CEO, Brit + Co.Welcome to the Maker Movement, an evolution of millions of people who are taking big risks to start their own small businesses dedicated to creating and selling self-made products.CommentsRobert KoehlerSyndicated writerThe system is broken. It\u0027s eating us alive. We do not value human life -- or, for that matter, life itself -- at the core of our social structure. But even the immensely powerful among us affect to value it after the fact, as rescuers pull bodies from the rubble and the survivors wail.CommentsJoel SchwartzbergEssayist, Author of \"The 40-Year-Old Version\"Not since the Supreme Court gave corporations First Amendment privileges has so much life been bestowed on non-living objects -- especially ironic, given the purpose of these particular objects is to end life in its tracks.Comments (131)Ellen CantarowBoston-based journalistAs their cancers developed, the victims of atomic testing and nuclear weapons development got a name: downwinders. Now, a new generation of downwinders is getting sick as an emerging industry pushes the next wonder technology -- in this case, high-volume hydraulic fracturing.Comments (13)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Trickle-down economics is the first cousin of austerity economics. Austerity is nuts when so many millions are out of work. And as we\u0027ve learned before, trickle-down is a fraud. Nothing ever trickles down.Comments (549)Jonathan RauchAuthor, \u0027Denial: My 25 Years Without a Soul\u0027My childish, playtime fantasy was freighted with a strange power. This was more than playing Batman and punching invisible enemies in the stomach. I wanted in a deeper, more slavishly yearning way to be Sinbad the Sailor.Comments (11)FoodbeastDude, you\u0027re eating that apple all wrong. Stop eating it from left-to-right, and start eating it from top-to-bottom.Comments (252)Wendy LitnerLawyer-turned-writer, SadintheCity.com bloggerI grew up resenting my mother, wanting so much to sever the strings that had me dance against my will as she plucked at them, up and down, to audiences\u0027 delight. But now that she\u0027s gone, I find myself desperately searching for a substitute hand to move me about my life.Comments (18)Bradley MylesCEO, Polaris ProjectHuman trafficking and slavery is in all of our backyards.

But there is still more we can do.CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityDSM-5 represents a wholesale, imperial medicalization of normality. So many new and untested diagnoses; so many reduced thresholds for the old ones. Pretty soon everyone will have a diagnosis and many will have a whole bunch of them.Comments (169)All Our KinNonprofit organization that trains, supports, and sustains community child care providersThe difficult and important work of caring for children -- so often assumed to be \"women\u0027s work\"-- is tragically undervalued, leaving parents and other caregivers unsupported.CommentsPeter ScheerExecutive Director, First Amendment CoalitionPublic employee unions face a new, and mortal, threat. It\u0027s not the unfunded liability of union pension plans or municipal governments\u0027 resort to bankruptcy to void union contracts.
