{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOFor all the ink spilled over this last week, two related issues were under-explored, the latter of which is especially important: what\u0027s \"rich,\" and why does it matter? What does McCain\u0027s wealth, and the way he talks about it, reveal about his ability to be a successful president? It\u0027s not just that McCain can\u0027t relate to have nots, it\u0027s that he doesn\u0027t really want to. He wants to pull the levers that Phil Gramm and others tell him work best, and he lacks the motivation to question whether these levers actually work.Read Post | CommentsBIOPhil Trounstine, 08.23.2008Biden brings to the Democratic ticket a glimmer of hope that all the things Obama wants to accomplish might actually get done in the next administration.Read Post | Comments (187)BIOJoseph Nye, 08.24.2008Even though polls show an increase in the attractiveness of China in recent years, it will take more than a successful Olympics to overcome the self imposed limits on Chinese soft power.Read Post | Comments (13)BIOBrandon M. Terry, 08.24.2008\"Race commentators,\" when Fox calls, tell them that you would deeply appreciate the opportunity to discuss racism in the US, but that Biden\u0027s campaign gaffe does not quite register enough for your earnest concern.Read Post | Comments (61)BIOCyndi Lauper, 08.24.2008Like Obama, I grew up with a loving, hard-working single mom, in a neighborhood mixed with all races and different backgrounds. And like Obama, I knew that was our strength and not our weakness.Read Post | Comments (76)BIOVerena von Pfetten, 08.24.2008Greetings from Denver! Your friendly HuffPost Living Editor is here to keep you posted on all the happenings at this fine Oasis of ours, including visitor commentary and VIP interviews with David Carr, Laurie David, and Don Hazen.Read Post | CommentsBIOJacob Heilbrunn, 08.23.2008The conventional wisdom is that Obama made a safe choice with Biden. It\u0027s wrong. It was a bold one that will further test his ability to coordinate his campaign effectively -- something he has done brilliantly so far.Read Post | Comments (66)BIOLionel Beehner, 08.24.2008So Biden, unlike Obama, is supposed to be a foreign policy guru. But his previous position on the most pressing issue of the day -- the war in Iraq -- is disturbing, if not downright muddleheaded.Read Post | Comments (44)BIOMichael Smerconish, 08.24.2008I know that some pundits, including Rush Limbaugh, are saying McCain can ill afford to alienate the right by selecting an abortion-rights advocate as a running mate. I disagree.Read Post | Comments (60)BIOAdele Stan, 08.23.2008It was obviously a failed attempt at humor -- or perhaps I\u0027m just a humorless feminist. Either way, one can only hope this isn\u0027t a harbinger of gaffes to come.Read Post | Comments (94)BIOSteve Clemons, 08.23.2008Biden\u0027s competence will help Obama be able to remain Obama. Insider or not, Biden is liked by the country -- and he\u0027s smart.Read Post | Comments (93)BIOWajahat Ali, 08.24.2008The choice of Biden, now officially cements Obama\u0027s ideological shift from a progressive message of \"change\" to a placating message of \"more of the same...but better than that other guy, we swear!\"Read Post | Comments (88)BIOLee Stranahan, 08.24.2008Read Post | CommentsJulian E.
