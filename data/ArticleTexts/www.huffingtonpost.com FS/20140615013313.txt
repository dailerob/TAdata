{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Former State Senator and leader of sixties peace, justice and environmental movement. Director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center.The U.S. had no business invading Iraq. We toppled a dictatorship on a false 9/11 rationale, which plunged Iraq into a sectarian civil war inside a war with the United States. We left behind a vengeance-driven Shi\u0027ite regime aligned with Iran. Now the sectarian war in Syria is enlarging into a regional one. The primary blame for this disaster is on the Bush administration, but also on all those who succumbed to a Superpower Syndrome, which said we could redesign the Middle East. There is no reason whatsoever to justify further loss of American lives or tax dollars on a conflict that we do not understand and that started before the United States was born.One might assume that life in the most religious states in the nation would approximate the idealized \"City upon a Hill\" envisioned some four hundred years ago by John Winthrop, the Puritan colonist who served as first governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony.

They\u0027re peddling three big lies about poverty.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027This is one of the main points of mindfulness -- that it isn\u0027t just about regulating your own thoughts and feelings but to use that clarity to communicate to the next person; it has a ripple effect. I call it neural wi-fi.Poster girl for mental illness, writer, performer and comedian writing about mental health and mindfulnessEventually the question will be asked -- \"Who lost Iraq?\" In a way, it might be seen as an improper question to ask since it presumes that Iraq was ours to lose. The fact that it was not, however, doesn\u0027t absolve us of responsibility.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Much of the discourse has focused on the needs and potential contributions of working mothers, but Father\u0027s Day weekend is an appropriate time to celebrate fathers and remind ourselves that work-life balance isn\u0027t just a women\u0027s issue.29th Ambassador of the United States of America to JapanThese are precisely the people who kicked open the sectarian hornets\u0027 nest in 2003 when they invaded Iraq and unleashed years of civil war that led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersYoga is a way of giving back.

Each day is a creative and positive day, when I\u0027m practicing yoga.Dancer and musicianAmerica is still struggling to live up to its creed enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and overcome its huge birth defects built into the implementation of our political and economic system.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe most direct way of defusing the political and interventionist pressures of the current mayhem in Iraq would be to release significant volumes from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve which currently harbors in excess of 700,000,000 bbls of oil.Author, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027Iraq is self-destructing. This led the Wall Street Journal to call for a few airstrikes and some American paratroopers to fix the problem, because we all know how well that turned out the last time, right?Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comMany of us -- myself included -- carry our mobile phones with us everywhere. But even as we have become so reliant on mobile phones, most of us don\u0027t pay close attention to our phone bills. And if you aren\u0027t reading your bill, it could really cost you.Commissioner, Federal Trade CommissionJust once, for your father, take his advice, thank your mother, chew with your mouth closed, stop making that face, finish your chores without any sass-back, and stick to one of these father-friendly films.Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comJudge Treu\u0027s opinion unfortunately reflects a misunderstanding of education research and teacher employment law\u0027s effects. His decision also erodes labor protections without increasing the likelihood of an excellent education for students in low-income communities.34Justice co-founder and bloggerIn the delivery room, I was dressed in my scrubs just like in the movies. My seat was next to my love, who was on the operating table, arms stretched out. There was a screen cloth right above her sternum obscuring her nether region.

Father. Writer. Founder of Daddyfiles.comAlong with all these multilayered personal responses, there was another, much less complicated reaction invoked as I listened to Sgt. Briggs\u0027 story, so I\u0027ll talk about that one instead. One that is direct, basic, and easy to say. The simple, pragmatic thought that, for me, as I listened, was the Elephant In The Room of this whole TED talk.Comedy writer and performerTo me, he was dad -- he could do no wrong. But to her, he was the man she fell in love with. A man who, no matter how wonderful of a person or incredible of a father he was (and he certainly was both of those things), would always be too sick to be a husband.In Pakistan, unless you are very well-connected, possession of guns is not an easy task. In contrast, the USA, one of the most advanced nations in the world, has such an easy access to guns that I am literally dumbfounded. And this access is coming at a terrible cost.Freelance journalist, PhD Student, Co-Editor Pak Tea HouseThe elder -- a 12-time Emmy-winning TV pioneer who counts among his creations The Dick Van Dyke Show -- and the younger -- an Emmy-winning actor and director, whose box office hits include films such as Misery and A Few Good Men -- reflect on their relationship and illustrious careers.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe stunning upset defeat of House Majority Leader, Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) by Professor David Brat, an economist from Randolph-Macon College, in Tuesday\u0027s Republican primary has several takeaways for progressives besides envy and shame over why they do not directly take on the corporate Democrats.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe Syrian conflict will ultimately end with negotiated power-sharing between the Syrian government, still headed by President Assad, and those elements of the opposition with some popular base inside Syria. This can happen relatively sooner, if America begins basing its Syria policy in on-the-ground reality.Authors, \u0027Going to Tehran\u0027; Penn State Professor and American University Senior LecturerIf only I could go back and tell that latchkey beer thief in 1969 that one day, he would have 11 children from nine different women, a thanksgiving table 29 feet long and eight grandkids at the ripe young age of 57, I wonder what he\u0027d say.Founder of AdoptTogether.orgIf you define \"bad teacher\" as \"whoever is standing in front of these low-testing students,\" it doesn\u0027t matter who stands there. Whoever it is, he\u0027s ineffective.Teacher, writer, blogger at curmudgucationIf sectarianism/tribalism is the king in the Middle East, why not adopt it rather than fight it?Introversion is one of the most misunderstood dimensions of personality.

Okay. Don\u0027t be scared.Poet, Professor, Feminist, American-Muslim, Ninja WarriorIn states like Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia and elsewhere across the South, changing demographics should alert us all to the need to stare more closely at how these lines are drawn -- and what a narrow sliver of voters can do to alter history.Georgia House Minority LeaderSome grandmas and grandpas consider being a grandparent their second chance at parenting, their opportunity to do things right, do things forgotten.writer, blogger, Grandma\u0027s BriefsGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"MILITANT SURGE SLOWS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
