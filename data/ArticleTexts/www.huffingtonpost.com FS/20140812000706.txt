{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghObama has stated that the U.S. will not become the Iraqi government\u0027s air force. Such an unequivocal declaration, though, presupposes that there is a functional substitute -- and one that will be available in time to deal with military threats of the first order that could emerge literally any day. So, this is a typical Obama fudge. Barack Obama is a temporizer, a devotee of half-measures, \"too clever by half\" as with his time-table limited mini-surge in Afghanistan in 2009. Any number of calculations, most deriving from domestic political considerations, could have figured in what he did -- and will do so in future decisions. He too often deceives himself that verbal declarations or pat phrases constitute a policy or program. Although the preferred course of action is far from clear, evasion of the tough issues and postponement of hard choices will lower the odds on coming up with wise decisions once they have to be taken.What purports to be a Senate Intelligence Committee report is in fact nothing of the sort; it is a partisan Democratic Senate committee staff report, masquerading as something it is not.Former Director of the CIA Counter-Terrorism Center (2004 to 2006); Author of the forthcoming \u002788 Days to Kandahar\u0027If we do not prosecute and discipline officers who break the law and who abuse their positions, then what sort of message does that send to the others? What kind of police culture does that create?President, National Action NetworkIt remains to be seen how involved the U.S. will get in this latest war in Iraq, and the price tag that will come with it. But the uncertainties of costly new wars makes it even more important that we clean up the mess of the old one.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstBeing a teenager today is not easy. As schools open throughout the country during August and September, teens are dealing with more than the normal stress that we dealt with before technology.Author and Parent and Family Internet AdvocateUkraine. Gaza. Syria. Yemen. Pakistan. If it feels like the United States is always at war somewhere, that\u0027s because it is. Not just Iraq and Afghanistan - the two wars we all know about. Why? The official line varies.Host and producer, HuffPost LiveOne of the prevailing narratives in American politics for some time has been that liberal judges are politically toxic. But events of last month could go a long way towards removing that fear, and making the possibility of liberal judges a reality rather than just a dream.Associate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.I\u0027ve lost count of how many times I\u0027ve heard, \"I could never do what you do,\" but I think that\u0027s only because people don\u0027t know what they are missing out on.women\u0027s fiction author www.gretedeangelo.comKwong is right: people are born puzzle solvers. I\u0027ve been inspired by how enthusiastically my children have learned language, absorbed math, mastered technology, become skilled athletes, and fallen in love. Life for them--for all of us--is an infinite variety of puzzles about what it means to be human and live in this world successfully.Author, BEACH PLUM ISLAND, THE WISHING HILLIn retrospect, shareholder capitalism wasn\u0027t all it was cracked up to be. Look at the flat or declining wages of most Americans, their growing economic insecurity, and the abandoned communities that litter the nation.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027With or without an infusion of massive amounts of international aid, clearing away the mess of this war will take years. Streets can be cleaned, but the wounds, both physical and mental, will not soon heal, nor will the survivors easily erase the feelings of helplessness, despair and anger with which they have been left.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Ferguson you are not alone. This is not just an African American issue. It\u0027s time for this to become a world issue.Author, leading empowerment specialist and CEO, Jamelle Sanders InternationalThe international community is failing to recognize that ISIS is an international -- not just Iraqi -- problem, as a hotbed of terrorism makes roots in such a vital area.Egyptian Copt; President, Board of Coptic SolidarityProblem: Your right-wing brother-in-law is plugged into the FOX-Limbaugh lie machine, and keeps sending you emails about \"Obama spending\" and \"Obama deficits\" and how the \"stimulus\" just made things worse. Solution: Here are three \"reality-based\" charts to send to him.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureMocking Erdo?an is easy. He provides more than plenty of reasons to dislike him. Those who wish for a less authoritarian Turkey ought, instead, to redeem liberalism globally.Director of the European School of Politics, IstanbulNew York Times columnist Tom Friedman\u0027s extended interview with President Obama shed some light on how Obama can be well-informed, thoughtful, prudent -- yet still be seen as faltering as a foreign policy president.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The following 50 novels, spanning different continents and various countries, are evidence that while our differences are superficial in the realms of love, hate, hope and peace we are united nations.WriterLong story short, Cuomo kept hammering the legislature as corrupt, evidenced by a series of thefts and misappropriations. He created an investigative commission that lurched into the world of petty thievery, and then lurched into the more interesting question of who was giving huge dollars to who, and for what.Senior Fellow, DemosMany people all over the country stand in somewhat ridiculous lines just to get a piece of the cultish grocery magic TJ\u0027s been offering since 1967. But did you know that your Trader Joe\u0027s grocery items actually tell so much about you and your hopes and dreams and T-shirts?Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelAs Iraq faces a governmental crisis and collapses into what looks to be a three-sided civil war, Republicans even other Democrats are alleging that Obama facilitated the rise of the Sunni radical group Islamic State. Though I am no fan of President Obama, such logic is breathtakingly horrendous.Senior Fellow and Director of the Center on Peace \u0026 Liberty, The Independent InstituteDaughter, I said I didn\u0027t have it in me to sit with the killing of Michael Brown last night and comb my social media accounts for first-hand anecdotes that would likely be more accurate than anything the news stations would report. But I stayed up anyway, because his neighbors had not gone home.Writer, mother, adjunct professor, and contributor to PostBourgie.com.With a clearer perception of the rightful concerns as promulgated in both the American and Russian experience given their proper weight, a more rational and constructive dialogue could emerge.Author, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027The sustainability perspective integrates economic growth, environmental protection and public health. I am confident that New York City\u0027s mayor and New York State\u0027s governor understand this. However, I see little evidence that they have integrated this way of thinking into their approach to politics, policy and governance.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteEach year, the lion\u0027s share of mercury poison comes from burning more than 8.3 billion tons of coal to provide energy for electricity grids. As a result of this insatiable addiction to coal, mercury toxicity has tripled in our oceans to over 80,000 tons of poison. Eighty-four percent of fish tested are laced with methyl-mercury.Broadcaster, Conservation BiologistIf ISIS and instability continue to become an increased national security threat, it is entirely possible that we have a third Iraq War. The true test of this presidency will be how Obama solves the Iraq quagmire as well as how he plans on defeating ISIS in Iraq.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications. www.hagoodman.comAs a nutritionist, I love recommending blueberries to my clients. And I regularly eat them as well. Blueberries are healthy, low in calories, versatile, and taste great.Nationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027Critics of UIUC\u0027s action do so not to defend someone critical of Israel -- it is to defend all scholars against the capricious will of administrators to deny employment to faculty who hold unpopular beliefs.Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityAmazon\u0027s e-book pricing dispute with Hachette raises a myriad of fascinating issues. But one aspect of the dispute is particularly fascinating: The crazy tone and content of Amazon\u0027s public statements.Environmental lawyer, dabbler in the literary artsWhile I realize not everyone will burn out or struggle simply because of illness or injury, my body made sure to remind me in the most aggressive of ways that it could, indeed, crash and burn if I wasn\u0027t more mindful of it being over-scheduled.While Kwong may have been overly eager to show his hand to the audience, his points are valid. Humans enjoy both order and chaos of varying degrees. But it is the line between these poles that we really seem to desire; therein lies the journey of exploration and deciding what to do with this experience that really keeps us on our toes.Art writer and criticOn the face of it, the gap between the Israeli and Palestinian negotiating position would seem hard to bridge. Lifting the Gaza blockade would hand Hamas a political victory. Demilitarization would constitute a political defeat.Senior fellow, S.
