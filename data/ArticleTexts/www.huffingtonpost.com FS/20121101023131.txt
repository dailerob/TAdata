{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Writer and FilmmakerSometimes, in the heat of an election, it is easy for voters to forget about the bigger picture. With three debates, endless soundbites, and, if you live in a swing state, a ceaseless barrage of television ads, it is hard for some to remember the context and history of the candidates\u0027 claims. It is this hectic environment that allows Mitt Romney to, suddenly, turn his back on two years of campaigning (all caught on video) on far-right positions and shake the Etch-A-Sketch and call himself a moderate. But sometimes, an event happens that shakes the electorate up and forces it to concentrate on who the candidates really are and what they stand for. It happened when the financial crisis hit in September 2008, and it is happening again in 2012 with Hurricane Sandy.Read Post | Comments (601)Cheryl Saban Ph.D., 10/31/12Author and advocate for women and childrenI observed the best in people during this storm.

They make us remember that government is the name we give to the things we choose to do together.Read Post | Comments (789)Arianna Huffington, 10/30/12The collective effort, the we\u0027re-all-in-this-together spirit, has been great to see after Sandy. But it shouldn\u0027t take a natural disaster to make us tap into our natural humanity.Read Post | Comments (291)Errol Morris, 10/31/12Award-Winning filmmakerIn the 2008 presidential election, roughly half of eligible voters from age 18 to 24 voted. An even smaller share of young voters is expected in 2012. I wanted to find out why. So I called more than 50 people under the age of 40 into a studio, and asked them.Read Post | Comments (389)Michael Moore, 10/31/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorI have a personal favor I\u0027d like to ask each of you.

Barbara Boxer, 10/31/12U.S. Senator from California; Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public WorksHurricane Sandy reminds us of a basic truth: Disaster relief and preparedness matter.

Granholm, 10/30/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyMitt Romney must realize that he has lost the industrial Midwest because he\u0027s completely lost a grip on reality. He\u0027s decided to throw a Hail Mary pass that will cause his already-struggling campaign to implode in Ohio.Read Post | Comments (705)Ari Melber, 10/31/12Attorney \u0026 Correspondent for The Nation magazineAn attack without an alternative isn\u0027t policy -- it\u0027s commentary.
