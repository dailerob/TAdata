{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogIt would have been difficult, after the 2014 elections, to imagine that President Barack Obama could achieve much of anything in his last two years in office. After all, the opposition Republican Party had taken control of both houses of Congress in the midterm elections in 2014. The Supreme Court, led by the right-leaning Chief Justice John Roberts, maintained a narrow conservative majority. And the president\u0027s approval rating had dropped below 50 percent. And yet here we are, only a few months after the new Congress took up residence on Capitol Hill, with a suddenly resurgent president. Just in the last few weeks, President Obama has been scoring a surprising number of domestic and foreign policy victories. His critics are cowed. The president reached a 50 percent public approval rating for the first time since May 2013.America has never formally acknowledged and apologized for the unspeakable evil of slavery. So I am asking Republicans and Democrats alike to apologize to the American people. Our continued refusal to apologize for slavery still shames and divides our nation. It is past the time to heal.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” published by HCI, December 2014Being a passive bystander is not a \"crime.\" If we have any hope at all of putting an end to incidents like these, we need to stop doubting the accusers and start holding rapists, abusers and bullies accountable.

Here are just a few to get us started.Public speaker, activist, OlympianThe question of how to proceed on the Greek crisis for pro-austerity European Union leaders, is not about helping Greece\u0027s economy recover, but about enforcing discipline and ensuring obedience to the pro-bank global neoliberal agenda they envision for Europe and the rest of the world.Former Staff Sergeant, Florida National GuardThe GOP has been doing a racist strip tease for decades now, and Trump is just skipping the tease. But it may point to a possible upside. Thanks to gauche clowns like Trump -- not to mention Cliven Bundy, Steve King and others -- the GOP, like the Democratic Party of the 60s, might be forced to reform itself, if only to end the pain.Founder of Boots Road Group LLC, a digital marketing agency for social goodIt\u0027s a sad and shameful truth that 50 years after the bloodshed in Selma -- 50 years after our prized Voting Rights Act -- African Americans have fewer, not more, voting protections today. This is a moral struggle. Once again, we must put on our marching shoes.President, North Carolina Conference of the NAACPA year ago, the script for 2016 was sealed -- Clinton II versus Bush III: advantage Clinton.

America\u0027s democracy is in dire need of an honest man.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsWhen we work towards inclusion and acceptance, we win championships. We bring out love in all of its forms and light up the world with it. It can help those of us who still face hate and discrimination. We should be changing the game, not each other.Director of Social Media, GO! AthletesAmericans shouldn\u0027t be expected to protect their rich cousins even if the latter were devoted to protecting each other. That the Europeans expect the U.S. to do their job is yet another reason for Americans to say no more.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThis month is \"Minority Mental Health Awareness Month,\" which is dedicated to raising awareness about mental health challenges --- especially in minority communities. Therefore, as a person of color, I feel compelled to share my journey to help saves lives, as I\u0027ve battled depression for years and was almost another suicide statistic.Author, blogger, project/program leader, business professor, life strategist, inspirational speaker, and radio hostYesterday, I read about a new project to place memorial markers at the 4,000 sites where African Americans were lynched in the South. It awoke the emotions I felt when I first viewed plaques on buildings in Paris memorializing Jews who were sent East by the Nazis and never seen again.Mike the Gun GuyStatistics inundate baseball, allowing for its players\u0027 performance to easily be compared and contrasted. For fans, this can lead to a game of analysis off the field. Let\u0027s combine baseball stats with some data analysis and ask the question: Did the players who most deserve to be called All Stars crack the roster?Associate Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science, Davidson CollegeHaving taken a step back to observe my dogs and other dogs too, the following is what I believe they would convey were they equipped with verbal communication capabilities that we could understand. Dogs would tell you these 10 things...life coach, writer, self-help and business blogger, entrepreneur, owner of Small Steps 2 Big ChangeWhile the profession of architecture discriminates against women, the rest of society objectifies women through the image of architecture. \"She\u0027s built\" is a common expression, and in a 1957 interview journalist Mike Wallace asked Frank Lloyd Wright, \"What do you think of [Marilyn] Monroe as architecture?\" Replied the architect, \"Extremely good.\"Chief Sustainability Officer, Perkins EastmanJeb! Bush, a boy born to wealth and privilege, whose family owns not a home but a compound of dwellings in Kennebunkport, Maine, and whose wife plunked down $25,600 for one pair of earrings, lectured last week that Americans should work longer hours.International President, United SteelworkersIf you have the time to play mobile video games or check your news feed, you have time -- even if it\u0027s five minutes -- to turn off your screen and focus on your emotional health. Whether this is through prayer or meditation or simply sitting quietly in a serene place, the \"mornings\" of our lives can give us the strength from within to achieve optimal mental health.Host, The Dr. Oz Show and Vice-Chair of Surgery at New York Presbyterian Hospital at ColumbiaFounding Chair, Director Emeritus of Action for Healthy KidsScott Walker will announce for president today. After standing for 25 primary and general elections in 25 years, he is poised to take his \"divide and conquer\" brand of politics to the national stage.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedBeing that Atticus Finch doesn\u0027t require that we attend white supremacy meetings, support police brutality or poison our own children with hate. It merely requires that we maintain our innocence amidst the maw of institutionalized racism, and mask our complicity in that system via periodic outrages at current events that clash with the saintly pictures we have painted of ourselves.D.C.-based writer and education activistThrough a community mobilization program that helped with issues such as agricultural production and access to water, Dukale, a poor coffee farmer, had started to lift his family out of poverty.International Development EconomistAcademy Award Nominated ActorThe weakening of a country in this specific area and under these specific circumstances would constitute not just a failure but a choice with grave strategic consequences.Regional Governor of Attica; member of SyrizaThe underlying question raised by the Greek financial crisis has been largely ignored, which is whether Greek adoption of the euro -- or even the creation of the Eurozone at all -- was a bad idea to begin with, and one that will not get better with time. This is the question that Germany must fear.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupNext week on July 14, the NASA spacecraft New Horizons will have completed its nine-year journey to Pluto. There is no telling what we will discover when we get there, but it will certainly be both alien and exciting!Astronomer, National Institute of AerospaceIn reality, there\u0027s nothing \"lone\" about drone warfare.

They\u0027re modest dreams. They\u0027re dreams that would allow them to keep working and leading the lives that they\u0027re already leading.Kiva FellowFor my whole adult life, I\u0027d felt bad about not dressing better. But I\u0027d also refused to give up ratty clothes or buy nice ones. I\u0027d pushed myself to obey contradictory internal commands: dress well, but don\u0027t throw things away or spend money. Finally, I broke free of the double bind.Like Dory from Finding Nemo: a kind heart, enthusiasm, \u0026 a tendency to forget what I know about the way home.
