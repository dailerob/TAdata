{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Canada Impact. Impact has always been a key part of HuffPost\u0027s DNA, and our goal of starting conversations and inviting our readers to connect, engage, and make a difference in the lives of others is perfectly captured by HuffPost Canada Impact\u0027s motto: \"One story can spark a flame, one person can make a difference.\" As HuffPost continues to expand internationally, and as our ability to connect and engage with others becomes less and less constrained by borders, we believe Impact has tremendous potential to helps us all widen the circle of our caring. In Canada, there\u0027s no better time than now to use all the tools at our disposal to widen that circle.Read Post | Comments (18)David Bromwich, 08/01/12Professor of Literature at Yale\"What would you like me to do?\" Can we read George Washington\u0027s warning words of 1796 addressed \"to the people of the United States,\" and compare Mitt Romney\u0027s words addressed to his donors in Jerusalem, and not feel a deep disturbance?Read Post | CommentsSen. Harry Reid, 08/01/12Senate Majority LeaderAsking American women to continue denying themselves the care they need is unacceptable. Only by focusing on America\u0027s best interest, rather than our own political interests, will we have a stronger, healthier future together.Read Post | Comments (14)Jesse Kornbluth, 08/01/12Editor of HeadButler.comVidal had no self-doubt. He used his legendary intellect in the service of opinions that drew blood. Feuds thrilled him. And he never lost the swagger that comes from knowing that -- at least in his youth -- he was a stunner. Want a guided tour?Read Post | CommentsAllison Berkowitz, 08/01/12Social WorkerThere were all too many days while looking at myself in the mirror, I wished I could literally rip the fat from my body. But I believe these feelings -- and most others that might arise -- are totally normal and have to be cleansed like the weight itself.Read Post | CommentsB.J. Epstein, 08/01/12Lecturer in literature and translation, University of East AngliaThe 2012 games have scarcely begun and they\u0027ve already started revealing the UK to be less respectful, careful and thoughtful towards other cultures than one would like to think.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 07/31/12Author, research psychologist, and gender expertSexuality is a big deal. But when talking about gay, straight, or anything else, the principles of how we want to teach our kids to live are the same as any other discussion about growing up right: Practice kindness and love and treat others as you\u0027d like to be treated. Plain and simple.Read Post | Comments (174)Rick Steves, 08/01/12Writer of European travel guidebooks and host of travel shows on public television and public radio (www.ricksteves.com)Locals don\u0027t want shady people pushing drugs in dark alleys; they\u0027d rather see marijuana sold in regulated shops.Read Post | CommentsEvie M. Salomon, 08/01/12Ernie Pyle Scholar, Indiana University Honors School of JournalismWhen Brian Rizoway and a group of students toured West Bank cities of Hebron and Bethlehem, his encounter with the other side of the Zionist narrative took him by surprise.Read Post | CommentsAshley Davis Bush, LCSW, 08/01/12Psychotherapist and author of Shortcuts to Inner PeaceGrief is a universal human experience that all of us will encounter eventually. Understanding what we can and cannot expect will help ease the process as it unfolds. Loss may change life as we know it, but the unknown is full of possibility.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 07/31/12Author, Commentator and Contributing Editor, TheLoop21.comPint-sized gymnastics powerhouse Gabby Douglas stands out for her strength, grace and show stopping routines, particularly on the uneven bars. She also stands out because of her race.Read Post | Comments (890)Stanice Anderson, 08/01/12Author and Recovery ExpertI know that if I did not try to make it right with Michael, I would not stay clean and probably die a slow, painful, and humiliating death. I would as I called it, \"misery away.\"Read Post | CommentsErica Berman, 08/01/12PhDShould these individuals, desperate for a child, and without other options, not proceed with what is often the most accessible and affordable means of getting a donated egg because their hypothetical child may want to know the identity of his or her biological mother?Read Post | CommentsZane J. Vanderberg, 08/01/12High school student in ColoradoI remember the last few years he lived here. He was depressed, drinking and always texting in the bathroom. I overheard his whispered phone conversations with his mistresses after Mom went to bed.Read Post | CommentsSec. Kathleen Sebelius, 07/31/12Secretary of Health and Human ServicesWomen\u0027s health decisions shouldn\u0027t be made by politicians or insurance companies. Rather than wasting time refighting old political battles, this Administration is moving forward and putting women in control of their own health care.Read Post | Comments (284)Cenk Uygur, 07/31/12Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027Romney\u0027s deeply offensive comments about the Palestinians probably won\u0027t hurt him in the election at all. There is no group in America you can insult with more impunity. But what does hurt is the overwhelming sense you get from Romney that he is looking down his nose at you.Read Post | Comments (1,366)Susan B. Dopart, M.S., R.D., C.D.E., 07/31/12Nutrition and Fitness ConsultantWhat\u0027s the truth about foods in a box or other container and how can you, as a consumer, decipher the truth and eat healthfully?

I\u0027d suggest we\u0027d have a lot less girls to \"fix\" if we acknowledged this.Read Post | Comments (77)Steve Knight, 07/31/12Co-Founder and Co-CEO, SogoMedia.TVLet me tell you about Billy Graham, just as he is, because based on what I experienced working for the man for six years, two statements issued under his name last week significantly collide with the well-established values of this great humble faith leader.Read Post | Comments (223)Jared Bernstein, 07/31/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesBill Keller seems to think that boomers, particularly affluent ones, should stop being so self-centered and accept lower benefits in Social Security and Medicare. But if that\u0027s your view, you shouldn\u0027t write a piece like his this week without pointing certain things out.Read Post | Comments (391)Samantha Daniels, 07/30/12President of SamanthasTable.com; Author, \"Matchbook: The Diary of a Modern Day Matchmaker\"Relationships are difficult, no matter what.

By now the entire world has gotten a chance to see that Mitt Romney is no foreign policy or diplomatic genius.Read Post | Comments (262)Vivian Diller, Ph.D., 07/31/12Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027A solution to bullying that involves surgical procedures is a terrible message to give both bullies and their victims. We need to be encouraging young people to admire and embrace differences -- and that starts from an early age.Read Post | Comments (49)Jacob Soboroff, 07/31/12Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveI say we stand strong, and stand together, and stop signing up for breaking news alerts from campaigns until they truly are breaking.Read Post | CommentsAshley Davis Bush, LCSW, 2012. 1.08Sarah Leon, 2012. 1.08Maria Rodale, 2012. 1.08David Bromwich, 2012. 1.08Donna B.
