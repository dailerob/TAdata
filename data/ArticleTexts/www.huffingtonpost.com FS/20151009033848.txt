{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027The U.S. needs to rethink our overall nuclear strategy. Our current strategy is still based on fighting a nuclear war with Russia. We should refocus it, and stop spending billions on an obsolete U.S. nuclear arsenal and move at least part of those funds to preventing ISIS or any other group from getting their hands on radioactive materials. It\u0027s time to stop fighting Soviets and shift our funds to fighting the terrorists that truly threaten us. The risk of ISIS getting their hands on nuclear or radiological weapons is small, but it is not zero. And that is too big of a gamble to take when American lives are on the line.Sleep is the wonder drug for the feeling of well-being. The CDC reports that insufficient sleep has been linked to the development of chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and depression. Fatigue from lack of sleep has been compared to being drunk.Voluntary professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Miami School of MedicineThe Greek philosopher Heraclitus famously wrote, \"A man\u0027s character\u0027s is his fate.\" This truth neatly captures Donald Trump\u0027s rise -- and inevitable fall -- as a presidential contender.Novelist and contributing opinion writerGoing through such a seismic, existential shift in my life? -- ?transitioning in a military prison -- presents real, meaningful, and daily challenges.Former U.S. Army intelligence analyst, military whistleblower and democracy advocateUpdating SNAP with new tools, innovations and resources requires the input of a broad range of public health, private sector, and governmental stakeholders. SNAP provides an important safety net for low-income families.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralYou think the public doesn\u0027t realize that your fingerprints are all over this thing? What do people think the Secretary of State does, for heaven\u0027s sake? Negotiate the nation\u0027s treaties, among other things. And you were the good soldier, plugging away at this agreement, for years and years before you suddenly didn\u0027t like it.Author, \u0027Free Trade Doesn\u0027t Work: What Should Replace It and Why\u0027What I found to be true for me is that without a good night\u0027s rest, I was more emotional, less resilient, less focused, had loss of memory and was more impatient. Just grumpy. That made my day super long and I was someone who wasn\u0027t as pleasant to be around. As a leader -- that\u0027s not a good thing.CHRO @ LinkedIn, Mother, Introvert, Writer, Artist, Adventurer - Always Curious -Leading with Authenticity - Having Fun!Kevin McCarthy\u0027s decision to pull out of the House Speaker race is a genuine political surprise only if you have ignored the steady move of the Republican Caucus from hard right-wing ideology to wrecker.Senior Fellow, DemosThe latest reports from the prestigious and sober Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make increasingly hair-raising reading, suggesting that the planet is approaching possible moments of irreversible damage in a fashion and at a speed that had not been anticipated.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeThe devastation of the Médecins Sans Frontières hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan by an American AC-130 gunship is a microcosm of much that is wrong with U.S. policies across the entire region: in a couple of words -- America\u0027s allies.Author, \"The Watchman\u0027s File\"We\u0027ve all heard and read about how Halloween has notoriously been a holiday where women are viewed as objects and retailers market \"sexy xyz\" costumes to them. We present an alternative. We\u0027re asking women to #ReclaimHalloween, and celebrate their own version of sexy: women who live from the inside out.Venture capitalist, Flybridge; Founder and CEO, SoSheDid.orgDemocrats do not seem up to the task of taking on this new breed of crazy. With the freak show called the GOP primary season in full swing, the time has come to offer up a political counterbalance to dangerous right wing extremism -- beyond what traditional Democrats can muster.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyArne Duncan did not invent political networks. And yet, to use a term of education professors Janelle Scott and Catherine DiMartino, he has acted as a \"gatekeeper\" by bringing a private network to the fore in education, and further opening public education to privatized influences.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.I wish someone would\u0027ve told me that I didn\u0027t have to lose my essence to make my mark. I would\u0027ve told my 14-year-old self during that time that the sound of my voice was beautiful and needed! And that I would be asked time and time again in my professional acting career to use a Spanish accent at every audition.Actress, currently starring in Netflix\u0027s \u0027Orange Is The New Black\u0027Die, monster, die! Every time you think that beast called the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- TPP for short -- is finished, it comes back like a bad penny; or in this case, trillions and trillions and trillions of bad pennies.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Most white people in the U.S. don\u0027t think a lot about white culture. We see whiteness as bland if we think about it at all. We often consider ourselves to be not white but a member of the ethnic group of the country that our ancestors left to come to the U.S.Dismantling racism from the inside outI was always pro-choice, but before this experience I was wishy-washy about late-term abortion -- even with my adjacent medical knowledge.A recent nationwide poll conducted by political scientists from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky shows that by a wide margin, Americans strongly favor equal treatment under the law over respecting individual religious beliefs when the two come into conflict.Assistant Professor of Politics, Centre CollegeBen Carson\u0027s fervent backers see all of this as the prescription for a new type of White House -- and better still, a change in the substance and style of governance. It will, of course, be nothing short of a colossal disaster and turn government into a laughingstock.Author and political analystI feel weird praising someone who represents the Catholic Church for simply practicing what he and his predecessors have been preaching for centuries. It isn\u0027t liberal to care that people are dying. It isn\u0027t revolutionary to want people to act with love before they act with hate.Feminist, college student, Minnesotan, writer and political junkieAt my first scareactor audition, I didn\u0027t understand how fun it would be to scare the sh*t out of random people. It\u0027s liberating to act in a new way and to have no one from your \"real\" life recognize you.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityA true winner, as Trump claims himself to be in life, would go all-in. Now. Immediately. But, Trump is not a true winner. He is an insecure, whining showman. A wimp.Last person on Earth not on FacebookAs a firearm owner, I\u0027ve researched, studied, and enjoyed sport-shooting for years; however, I hold no romantic ideas about firearms: They are tools of death. Education is about life while firearms are about taking life. There should be no confusion about which we should support on college campuses.Writer, Professor, Rhetorician, \u0026 Internet ResearcherIn just two more days, we will finally meet in person. Two days is not nearly enough time to prepare for this meeting, although in reality, I have had nearly 21 years to do that. You see, I am going to meet my firstborn son and his mother. His real mother.Writer, mother, lawyer and seeker of balance.I want you to learn at a very early age to be comfortable talking about your anxieties, struggles and fears. Most importantly, I hope these eight things help you live an authentic life with the understanding that you\u0027re never alone.Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThe loss of my fertility is not going to define me. I do not want people to feel bad for me. I don\u0027t want people to question why I need to do IVF because I got pregnant so quickly the first time. I don\u0027t need questions about everything we have tried.Communicator, advocate, news junkie, proud Democrat and mom to pit bull Max living the sweet life in Portland, Ore.\"I\u0027m a grinder....I\u0027ve never taken more than a week off in my adult life.

Sign up at www.theskimm.com/huffpo to start your day off right.It is an untenable situation, an insult to the institutions -- Federal Police, MPF, House of Representatives -- and one that jeopardizes the fight against corruption. Resign, Cunha.Editor in Chief at Brasil PostI have high-functioning autism. I was diagnosed at age three. A lot of people on the spectrum do not go to college, or are unemployed, or do go and may not succeed. I was one of the ones who thrived.Author of two books, artist, autism advocate, University of Miami law studentIn implicating Trump as a bigot and, by association, the audience as cohorts or sheep, the media, especially the photo media, thoroughly missed the most curious and unscripted moment of this dispiriting campaign.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, Reading The Pictures.The fate of women in Afghanistan has been the moral linchpin for the continued occupation by U.S. and NATO forces since the presidency of George W. Bush.
