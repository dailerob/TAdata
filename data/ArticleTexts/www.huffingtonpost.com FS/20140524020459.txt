{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressFrankly, Green Lantern Theory isn\u0027t just a dumb and bewildering critique of presidential power, it also lies at the root of a dumb and bewildering defense of presidential power. If you spend enough time in the wild, you\u0027ll inevitably find ardent fans of a president, who truly believe that every setback suffered by the object of their affection is secretly just one part of a hidden gambit on an 11th-dimensional chessboard that leads to certain victory. So there\u0027s a constant need to demystify this hack nonsense (which enjoys the advantage of being super-easy to write in bulk). But more importantly, it\u0027s important to actually provide an avenue to a sensible critique.Ta-Nehisi Coates, a senior editor at The Atlantic magazine, thinks it\u0027s time for a bold step to change the way we talk and think about race in America. This week, I speak to Coates about his June cover story for the magazine, provocatively titled \"The Case for Reparations.\"Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyOver 20 years ago, a lost recording of J.R.R.

Until recently, only he had heard the recording.Noble SmithAuthorWhen you are employed, looking for a new job is filled with dangers. You need to be careful your current employer doesn\u0027t discover that you are considering leaving. I call it a \"stealth job search.\"Susan P. JoyceOnline job search expert, Job - Hunt.org writerFoster care is intended to be a temporary solution during one of the darkest times of a child\u0027s life, but the average length of stay is nearly two years, and every year more than 23,000 youths \"age out\" of foster care at age 18 or older without being connected to a forever family.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe existence of judicial review matters only when the courts hold a law unconstitutional. A central question in evaluating this element of our constitutional structure is whether courts have exercised this authority wisely.Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe major news of the announcement was the shock exclusion of Landon Donovan, the team\u0027s all-time leader in goals and assists. But the move was not the only surprise in the final round of roster cuts, which, considered together, paint a puzzling picture of the manager\u0027s decision-making.Bryan MaygersManaging Blog Editor, The Huffington PostNo Child Left Behind, \"school choice,\" \"recovery school districts,\" and Common Core are what the United States has done to solve the education \"crisis.\" Mind you, the \"crisis\" is that the United States is not number one in education.Shayna A. PitreLegal Researcher and WriterPope Francis\u0027 trip to Israel beginning on May 25 is clearly an important visit, as any papal appearance is. Its greatest importance may lie in the fact that it reflects the normalization of relations between the Vatican and the State of Israel, not to mention Catholic-Jewish relations more broadly.Abraham H. FoxmanNational Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueForget the salad wraps or apple slices -- McDonald\u0027s is now serving up an even more creative alternative, in an attempt to satisfy thousands of workers demanding fair wages and respect at the workplace.Jack TemplePolicy Analyst, National Employment Law ProjectDespite several years of above-average economic growth, lack of inclusive development is a huge concern.

One of my most important and dearest mentors is gone; there are countless other people across America -- indeed, around the world -- who are feeling the same as me. But he really hasn\u0027t gone; his memory and presence will continue on with us in a \"cloud of witnesses,\" which is the most important thing Vincent ever taught me.Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIs it time for me to surrender and join the bullish herd? No.Terry Burnham, Ph.D.Finance professor, Chapman UniversityWho hates whom, and why? What do we mean when we say, I hate? And what do we do about it?Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027People always want to talk to me about being black. Or Jewish. Or black and Jewish. Or when they hear me talk about my racial identity, they want to share their own racial experiences. I know that in a lot of ways, I am a cultural and ethnic enigma. But in all honesty, it can get old.Sarah GladstoneA writer, a woman, a daughter, a friend, in that order.In many ways, the upcoming Egyptian presidential elections, which will take place on May 26-27, are an object lesson in how to fix an election while presenting a façade that everything is free and fair.Neil HicksInternational Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstToday -- shortly before the European elections -- we all can be a little relieved, take an interim balance and say: Yes, for now the efforts on both sides have been worth it. Europe, its states and the Euro did not prostrate.Volker KauderLeader of the Conservative Party in the German BundestagThe president\u0027s pledge last May to close Guantanamo came amidst a mass hunger strike at the prison by men protesting their indefinite detention. Since then only a handful of men have been released from Guantanamo, where hungers strikes and brutal force-feedings continue.Coleen RowleyFormer FBI Special AgentThis system of destruction on a planetary scale, facilitated by most of the ruling and corporate elites on the planet, is becoming (to bring into play another category not usually used in connection with climate change) the ultimate \"crime against humanity\" and, in fact, against most living things. It is becoming a \"terracide.\"Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comLawmakers today are for some reason reticent about using the same credit card that funded the wars to adequately fund veterans\u0027 health care costs.H. A. GoodmanAuthor and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications.If you\u0027ve said any of these, don\u0027t feel bad (unless you\u0027ve stolen a handicap parking spot!). We aren\u0027t angry or offended, but we want people to understand.Rachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityIn this age of YouTube and endless TV, it takes passion to fulfill yourself with the written word. Yet the book nerd thrives, surviving on the scent of old books and the meaty thoughts of great writers.Beth BartlettWriter, humorist, pop culture geekAs Nate, 29, walked through the kennels, Otis was the only dog not barking excitedly -- he was just leaning his face against the fence and hoping for some love. Nate took the American Bulldog for a walk in the parking lot, the pup instinctively trotted straight to his car, and it was love.Helaina HovitzJournalistMegyn Kelly was supposed to be a harbinger of Fox News\u0027 \"gay rights revolution,\" but she\u0027s used her primetime spot to enable some of the country\u0027s most extreme anti-LGBT activists.Equality MattersEqualityMatters.org is a media and communications initiative in support of LGBT equality.Arthur Gelb was a master builder, the Robert Moses of newspapering.

To me, she isn\u0027t a success story at all: she is a novelty, a tiresome example of white female privilege and the delight white culture finds in white people appropriating any and everything.Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistA few nights ago I attended our high school choir concert. It was particularly bittersweet because our young choir director has had quite a year.Peter GreeneTeacher, writerWhen I think about how hard my mother worked to send me and my siblings to school, I know that these girls\u0027 mothers are working just as hard.
