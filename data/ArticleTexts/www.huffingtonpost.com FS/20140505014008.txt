{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, NBA commissioner Adam Silver brought the hammer down on Donald Sterling over the LA Clippers owner\u0027s leaked racist rant, banning him from the NBA for life and pledging to force Sterling to sell the team. It wasn\u0027t just the harshness of Sterling\u0027s racism that shocked, but also the casualness. The resulting media firestorm reignited questions about the way the league had long turned a blind eye on Sterling\u0027s even-more-outrageous history of housing discrimination based on race -- and why the LA chapter of the NAACP was nevertheless on the verge of honoring Sterling with a lifetime achievement award. Meanwhile, on Thursday the Obama administration released a list of 55 higher education institutions under investigation for not adequately handling allegations of sexual assault. The scrutiny and transparency are good first steps but real progress would mean greatly reducing the assaults themselves.

My family is dirt poor; people today seem to forget that in America today families still exist who don\u0027t have TV, who don\u0027t have A/C, whose electricity gets cut off regularly, and who can\u0027t afford to buy meat.Cory BrooksSenior at George Washington UniversityThe way to end poverty is not to cut the very programs that are making the difference.

They restore world order around America\u0027s idea of what racism is supposed to look like.Danielle CadetEditor, Black VoicesThere\u0027s no reason, in spite of the brutal nature of his crimes, that Lockett should have died in that practically medieval way. His penalty was death, not 24 minutes of what can only be defined as state-induced torture... and then eventual death.

Anyone who ever doubted that reality can look at the events of the past week.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhen Sarah Palin commented, at this last week\u0027s national National Rifle Association convention, \"...waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists,\" she did worse than offend, worse than degrade human beings, worse than stir up a group of weapon-advocates.
