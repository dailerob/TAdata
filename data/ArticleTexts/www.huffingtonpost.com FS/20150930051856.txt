{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawThe Supreme Court speaks not only through its rulings in cases argued before it, but also through its choice not to hear certain cases -- the ones denied certiorari, in legal lingo. By refusing to hear claims brought by victims of Bush-era torture and detention practices, and failing to decisively reject the government\u0027s array of bad excuses for denying them a modicum of justice, the Court in recent years has sent an appalling message of indifference and impunity. These missing cases constitute a profound stain on the court\u0027s record, and they are worth recalling on this week\u0027s tenth anniversary of John Roberts\u0027s swearing-in as Chief Justice.We know exactly what Planned Parenthood does for millions of people in this country, and we will not let those committed to ending abortion access use fraud and deception to cut millions of people off from high-quality preventive care.President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood VotesOn the vote to raise our flag at the U.N., the international community demonstrated its solidarity with the Palestinian people. Now it must act with urgency to seize the momentum from this symbolic gesture and provide a clear plan to end the illegal Israeli occupation, uphold human rights and achieve justice.Palestinian Authority PresidentIn a speech last week, Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen inadvertently told us why Congress should set a 4 percent unemployment target for the Fed in its conduct of monetary policy, as is proposed in a new bill put forward by Michigan Representative John Conyers.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027A presidential poll released as Speaker Boehner made his announcement shows Republicans want something no Republican candidate is talking about.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarBonding through our stories is crucial because it can create a global dialogue in which each voice matters as opposed to the cacophony of opinions we tend to replace them with. Connecting the dots between your life and those of others is what women do well. Now is the right time to help women and girls tell their stories.Award-winning writer and managing editor of CHIME FOR CHANGEIf one says the word \"miscarriage\" out loud, does that feed its evil powers? Do we fear that communing over this type of loss only makes it grow stronger?Tony Award-winning actressThere\u0027s a stunning unreality to the right-wing attack on John Boehner as insufficiently conservative.Senior Fellow, DemosDrug warriors claim that marijuana is a \"gateway drug.\" On the contrary, it is the policy of drug prohibition--not the drug per se--that creates a gateway into a criminal underworld of crime and contaminated products.Former Chicago prosecutor, international development professional, and member, Board of Directors, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP)This week, the United Nations unveiled 17 goals that comprise the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A smart place to start: The connections between human health and planet. If we wait to focus on planet until after the SDGs sunset in 2030, it will be much too late.President of The Rockefeller FoundationWhen classified information gets in the hands of our enemies and rivals, bad things happen for our beleaguered intelligence forces. General Petraeus gets that it is wrong. But as Clinton blames Republicans for her woes on NBC\u0027s Meet the Press, it\u0027s clear she still just doesn\u0027t get it.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaDid you make it through Sunday\u0027s lunar eclipse okay? If truth can protect us from jaguars, dragons, demons and preachers, why can\u0027t it protect us from presidential candidates whose stories rank right up there with the Incas\u0027 and the Mundas\u0027?USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorBy now many of you have likely read \"Why Students Hate School Lunches,\" by Kate Murphy in this week\u0027s New York Times Sunday Review. Here\u0027s my one word reaction to the piece: GAH!!!!Former lawyer, freelance writer and blogger at The Lunch TrayGovernor Brown: I urge you to sign ABX2-15. Give me and the dozens of other amazing humans I\u0027ve met on my journey with cancer (and the countless others I\u0027ve never met) some peace and relief from the dread of those final months.Nonprofit fund development and communications consultant, currently living with brain cancerBeing a homemaker is not something you could go to school for or get a degree in. It is something that you learn at home and witness everyday. It is a gift that comes naturally from the heart of these women. A passion. It is instilled in you purely from growing up around a great one.Singer, songwriter, rapperThe United States is one of the few nations on the planet where paid family and medical leave or earned sick time is not the law of the land. In fact, only 12 percent of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employers. Access to paid leave is particularly low among Hispanics, African Americans and low-wage workers.U.S. Secretary of LaborOur marriage benefits the world in the same ways a straight marriage does: Together, we are more resilient, we are stronger, we have more to give. And I promise you, if you knew us, you\u0027d understand how solid our love is, how worthy of honor and recognition.Businesswoman, mother and writerToday marks the 10th anniversary of the day Chief Justice Roberts was sworn in to the Supreme Court. In that decade, he has led a Court that has radically reshaped vast swathes of the law, undermining constitutional protections for civil rights and voting rights, reproductive freedom, workplace fairness, the environment, gun violence, consumer fairness and representative democracy as a whole.President, People For the American WayOf course, I cannot speak for every Mormon woman. Each of us has a different experience, but here are a few of the experiences which I think unite us. I hope that this make us as a whole a little less mysterious to outsiders, and perhaps even to the Mormon men who think they know us so well.Mormon mother of 5, author of \u0027The Bishop\u0027s Wife,\u0027 Princeton PhD, nationally ranked triathleteAnother day, another person proves that Carly Fiorina didn\u0027t see the video that she claims she saw. What\u0027s interesting is that, this time, it is the person who is responsible for collecting the very footage that Fiorina claims she viewed.Public Relations Consultant, www.winningprogressive.comPerhaps, just maybe, being a Christian isn\u0027t the most important qualification when it comes to selecting a president. The president\u0027s job isn\u0027t to be the pastor of our country. The president\u0027s vocation is to lead and protect and govern the nation -- all of its citizens, not just one religious denomination.English teacher, scholar, and writer living in the Midwest.I lost my two-year-old daughter to a rare and as yet incurable disease. So when I pictured a man like Mr. Shkreli someday holding the key to a terminally ill two-year-old\u0027s only hope of survival, I became literally sick.Founder, Chloe\u0027s Fight Rare Disease FoundationLiberals and conservatives, Protestants and Catholics are all having to come to terms with an increasingly secular landscape. Aspiring to be more like Ross Douthat\u0027s vision of Christian orthodoxy, in other words, is no longer a hedge against decline, if it ever really was.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistEver seen one of those cute stock photos of a mom working productively at her laptop, with her toddler nestled contentedly on her lap? I hate photos like that.Founder and CEO, Mom CorpsDudamel has become the embodiment of the cultural renaissance of Los Angeles. I never tire of watching the dip in his knees when a particularly pungent musical passage comes along and then the way he rises on his toes for a fanfare. His solidarity with the youth of his troubled native country is commendable and this is where he feels his focus should be. But is the Ode to Joy Dudamel\u0027s sotto voce answer to his critics who decry his silence on Venezuela? Beethoven may have been deaf, but Dudamel is not.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnMany may be surprised to learn about Congress\u0027 closeted assault on imperiled wildlife. The public deserves to know because when it comes to this issue, Congressional action is directly contradicting public opinion.President \u0026 CEO, Defenders of WildlifeThis news about the true nature of the perplexing Martian lineae urges us to discover what centuries of peering at the Red Planet with telescopes and orbiters was never able to do: Find the Martians.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteToday, 54 million Hispanics and Latinos live in the United States, and Latinos are one of the fastest growing ethnic minorities in the country. But less than one-percent of all national historic landmarks and only roughly 4 percent of all national park units are dedicated to the Latino community.Deputy Director of the Public Lands Project, Center for American ProgressFounder, president and CEO of GreenLatinosIf you thought Food, Inc. was a documentary about food that gave you second thoughts about what we eat, Cowspiracy, streaming on Netflix and co-produced by Appian Way (DiCaprio) will leave you sputtering with rage.Writer, Editor, Speaker, StorytellerBen Carson is trying to portray his stance on Muslims and Sharia law as defending the United States Constitution. But by making the argument for the separation of mosque and state but not church and state, he is showing his own hypocrisy.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIf you were to isolate the single most striking, if little discussed, aspect of American foreign policy in the first 15 years of this century, it might be that Washington\u0027s inability to apply its power successfully just about anywhere confirms that very power; in other words, failure is a marker of success.Editor, TomDispatch.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
