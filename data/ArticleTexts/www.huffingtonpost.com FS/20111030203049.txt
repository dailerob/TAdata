{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Halloween is tomorrow, so this week people in the news were trying on costumes and masks, deciding who they want to be. In sports, the St. Louis Cardinals were the ultimate Cinderella, going from 10.5 games behind in late August to World Series champs. In the GOP race, Rick Perry couldn\u0027t make up his mind. At first he decided to go retro, donning a Steve Forbes-inspired look as Flat Tax Man. But I guess that wasn\u0027t scary enough, so he switched to a more modern -- and much creepier -- mask: Birther Guy. Meanwhile, the Oakland police department apparently has decided to come as Richard Daley\u0027s 1968 Chicago police force, with injured Iraq war vet Scott Olsen left looking like the civil rights protesters bloodied on Selma\u0027s Edmund Pettus Bridge.

Governor Rick Perry was telling us how simple it would be to fill out a tax form for those who bought into his plan. And to illustrate his point he pulled out what looked to be a blank 5\"x7\" card.Read Post | Comments (445)Arianna Huffington, 10/24/11Just as solutions to the problems facing Europe and America are not going to be found in traditional political ways, the truth of what\u0027s happening is not going to be found in traditional media coverage either.Read Post | Comments (467)Van Jones and Jakada Imani, 10/26/11This kind of crackdown we\u0027re seeing in Oakland is bad for our democracy, and it\u0027s bad for public safety. Mayors and police chiefs at Occupy sites across the country should take note: this is the wrong way to respond to the Occupy movement.Read Post | Comments (1,495)Lisa Belkin, 10/24/11The Huffington Post’s Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family.Time was when our support circles were nearby family and friends; but now families have scattered, and friends are never home, and so much of what we know comes from places like this one.Read Post | Comments (100)Alec Baldwin and Mike Farrell, 10/25/11A quick glance tells us the most active killing states comprise the \"Old South,\" and a look at the racial makeup of death row today suggests to many that it is a relic of slavery.

In particular, this absence will eventually lead to a serious deficit in the overall education of our youth.Read Post | Comments (55)Conrad Black, 10/28/11Historian, publisher, authorIt is disturbing that as the United States flounders through one of the most precipitate declines of prestige and economic and fiscal strength in its generally upwardly mobile history, there is such a scarcity of galvanizing candidates to take the headship of the country.Read Post | Comments (126)Herbie Hancock, 10/27/11MusicianMy lesson for young people is to be willing to go out of your comfort zone and explore new territory. I never thought that at age 71 I would be creating a \"crowd-sourced\" music video with digital cameras that can blast images around the world in minutes. But I am.Read Post | Comments (90)Lee Woodruff, 10/24/11WriterLet\u0027s set aside for the moment that the general area of the colon is NOT my favorite body part.

Dianne Feinstein, 10/27/11U.S. Senator from CaliforniaEvery 3 minutes -- about the time it takes you to listen to your favorite song -- someone is diagnosed with breast cancer.
