{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn my view, universities have a deep obligation to protect and preserve the freedom of expression. That is, most fundamentally, at the very core of what makes a university a university. This has not always been true. Throughout history, universities have limited freedom of expression in all sorts of ways. In the 19th century, they often forbade the expression of any views that were inconsistent with Christian religious doctrine, including of course the doctrine of evolution. In the 20th century, they often forbade the expression of any views that were seen as unpatriotic during World War I or as communistic during the McCarthy era. Today, the battle is primarily over expression that makes students feel uncomfortable or unsafe. The principles, though, are the same.To support additional public services for refugees, countries neighboring conflict zones will require more financial resources. The international community must play its part. With the IMF\u0027s support, for example, Jordan has been able to adjust its fiscal targets to help meet this need. Ultimately, however, one thing is very clear: No country can manage the refugee issue on their own. We need global cooperation.Managing Director, IMFSocial media pictures and platitudes doesn\u0027t make one pro-veteran. Listening, and heeding the call of veterans makes someone pro-veteran.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranWomen leave for many reasons, but there\u0027s one reason in particular that haunts me, one that I want men to understand: Women leave because their man is not present.Counsellor and Certified Hakomi TherapistThe Obama administration surely negotiated the TPP in good faith, and the accord would likely add to global and U.S. economic growth. This is not a pernicious accord, the fruits of a secret cabal as some have feared. Nor is globalization an evil to be fought tooth and nail. The sad truth, however, is that while the administration promised a 21st-century agreement, we have yet another late 20th-century agreement.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityLet\u0027s quit beating around the bush: Warlords are ruining America -- and not just as measured by the Gross Domestic Product and nerdy stuff like that. Warlords are making America less fun. Less can-do. Less a place where people can agree to give a little to get a little.Impact entrepreneur with a track record in community-led innovation, social enterprise and high-performance government.Talk of national support is a wonderful thing, and so is giving jobs to veterans, but this is about providing good jobs, not just any job. Through our hard work and sacrifices we, and countless other workers in retail, deserve better wages, better benefits and the opportunity to earn a better life.Army veteran, Walmart employeeNavy veteran, Walmart employeeArmy veteran, Walmart employeeWe have passed laws forbidding discrimination against people because of their color or sexual orientation, but those laws are under attack now. This fear-driven backlash has twisted discrimination into a freedom of religion.Actress and authorThis trend of catastrophization is so dangerous -- instead of spreading awareness of racial, gender and economic inequality, it shifts the focus toward policing speech and shaming perceived transgressors. As liberals, we need to remember is that this behavior violates two fundamental assumptions of our ideology.The conversation no one else is having.The men and women in America\u0027s wars today are a much different generation than mine, of course. But some things about war never change. For that reason, the bond I feel with those with whom I served a half-century ago extends to those who serve today.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectAs a Black trans woman, I am used to unfair and discriminatory treatment, but this was extra upsetting because we were paying customers at a hotel and on our way to a funeral. I felt like I had no rights.Proud transgender woman from Illinois studying cosmetologyThe Gulf War, as that conflict became known, was a short, bizarre war, and my involvement in it no less so -- I was placed under arrest as I was trying to board my flight to Saudi Arabia, I was arrested in the middle of the war, and I was threatened with arrest at the time of my departure from Saudi Arabia.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Jon Meacham\u0027s new biography of George H.W. Bush is causing a frothy and indignant stir in the Bush inner circle. I had my own experience writing an insider\u0027s account of a Bush White House.Congressman from New York\u0027s 3rd Congressional District; Author of the book \u0027The Global War On Morris\u0027A fundamental mystery underlies this season\u0027s Republican presidential primary debates: How can it be that the two highest-polling contenders -- Donald Trump and Ben Carson -- are also two of the field\u0027s least capable debaters?Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonTwo points were made in the October debate that deserve scrutiny. One was voiced by several candidates, from Senator Rand Paul to Governor Chris Christie: Namely, that the government has been \"stealing\" from Social Security. The other is that Social Security is a giant Ponzi scheme Let\u0027s discuss why this is a terrible misrepresentation of this program and how Social Security actually works.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.The students at the University of Missouri should be commended and praised by everyone that believes in the notion of progress. They showed the nation and the world that they have the right method -- a method that civil rights groups used for years -- a collective strategy of all, utilizing economic leverage along with a disciplined, focused and determined non-violent movement.President, National Action NetworkIn the effort to stop gun violence, there is a way around the Congress, if President Obama is willing to seize the opportunity and use the purchasing power of the federal government -- as well as states and municipalities -- to make the gun industry assume corporate responsibility for its lethal products and change its ways.Former U.S. CongresswomanExecutive Director, New Yorkers Against Gun ViolenceThe 323-page report, released on Monday, November 9, by the World Anti-Doping Agency (or WADA), implicates athletes, coaches, trainers and athletic institutions in a widespread drug-cheating program.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.We first sought out a couples\u0027 therapist when our daughter, now 18, was an infant. We were unhappy, our marriage lacked intimacy and we were worried about our prospects. Of course, many parents of newborns are unhappy. But we knew something deeper was amiss.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillAssistant Director, Lineberger Cancer Center, UNCIt has been said that when the U.S. economy catches a cold, Puerto Rico gets pneumonia. For the last decade, the island has been mired in a recession and fiscal crunch, which led Puerto Rico\u0027s governor to announce this summer that the island is running out of money. Critically, the economic challenges facing the island are leading to a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportion for the 3.5 million American citizens who live there.President and CEO, National Council of La RazaHearing Chelsea\u0027s voice was a powerful reminder: President Obama may talk a good talk when it comes to gay rights, but his Administration\u0027s policies speak louder than his speech-writer\u0027s words, and they\u0027re detrimental to LGBTQ people around the world.Campaign Director of Fight for the Future, radical queer singer/songwriter, parent, lover and fighter. She / hers pronouns pleasePretrial detention is a strong predictor of whether a defendant will be sentenced to prison at the conclusion of the criminal case. Defendants who cannot afford bail and spend months in jail can suffer job loss, education disruption, the loss of housing, and many other dire collateral consequences.Professor, American University Washington College of Law; Executive Director of the Pretrial Racial Justice InitiativeAssociate Director of the Pretrial Racial Justice Initiative and Principal Consultant at The Justice Management InstituteThere is still a lot of stigma associated with a teenage pregnancy. I hope to build a village of acceptance and support around every person facing teen pregnancy and parenthood so they have the opportunity to grow a happy, healthy, skilled family, with healthy children.CEO and Founding Director of Brave FoundationAs others have pointed out many times, during the challenging times and amid layoffs at HP, Carly chose to purchase Gulfstream corporate aircraft. This doesn\u0027t sound like great judgment. Now we\u0027re being asked to open up the office of the presidency.Investment professional and author, \"The Fall of Telecom\"This Veterans\u0027 Day, world peace feels a long way off. The United States is in its 14th year of war. After all these years of bloodshed and trauma, we as a society still haven\u0027t grappled with the burden our military, and their families, continue to bear.Former United States Navy Psychiatrist. United States Congressman, Washington 7th. Senior Member House Budget Committee, Committee on Ways \u0026 Means. Ranking Member Health Subcommittee, Ways \u0026 Means.Like your high school English teacher probably told you, it is important to show and not just tell a story. Servicemen and women are people of action. So, if you really want to show your appreciation for their service, don\u0027t just thank them, do something.Cincinnati attorney, officer in the US Army Reserve, and partner with the Truman National Security ProjectWar trauma brings in its wake a collapse of time. The present is engulfed; the past colonizes moment-to-moment experience; and the future is collapsed. Severe PTsxD and all variants of PTspD are characterized by an experience of haunting.Founder, Deep Streams Institute and Coming Home ProjectComcast incurs almost no additional cost in terms of how much data you use. Once that \"pipe\" is built, it\u0027s cheap to operate. In essence, Comcast is imposing these arbitrary limits and penalties on customers simply because it can.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressSurely someone should ask the Democratic candidates if they favor that the rich will make their children rich, without them having to put in a day of work, while those with low incomes will never be able to buy a home or even an apartment, and will leave their kids only debts?Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThere are six fundamental reasons that explain why the present geopolitical environment is conducive for the resumption of peace negotiations and why outside constructive intervention has become sine qua non to reaching an equitable peace with security.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUVeterans deserve a chance to shine after their military service, and today\u0027s companies need their skills and talent.
