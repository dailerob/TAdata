{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Much of the discussion since the election has focused on what\u0027s wrong with Republicans -- why they misread the data, how they\u0027ll regroup and how the long-range demographics are increasingly against them. But more pressing is the fact that a new presidential term starts on January 21st with our country facing a myriad of urgent problems. President Obama still has the opportunity to have a transformational presidency -- but, as he has said again and again, bringing about the changes we need is going to require the active participation of all of us. So here\u0027s just a partial list of issues -- from foreclosures, drones and prisons to the drug war, climate change, and the voting process -- that need to be finally, and seriously, addressed in Obama\u0027s second term. We need to continue to push for all of these issues. It\u0027s up to citizens not just to elect presidents but to make them better.Read Post | Comments (343)David Bromwich, 11/14/12Professor of Literature at YaleThe largest hope of 2012 surely rests not with the president, but with those senators of political skill and passion who have been elected or reelected. They may give the party a backbone it has missed in recent years. For these are unembarrassed Democrats, none of them as immature as Obama was in 2008.Read Post | Comments (293)Gretchen W. McClain, 11.14.2012President and Chief Executive Officer, Xylem Inc.As the recent devastation from Hurricane Sandy has made tragically visible, our country\u0027s water infrastructure is in critical need of greater investments and modernization. And what better time to revitalize our infrastructure than now, in the wake of this month\u0027s elections -- with a second administration for the President and a new Congress on the way?Read Post | Comments (15)Gov.

Thank you for your battle scars. Scars that show you\u0027re willing to fight worthy battles on our behalf.Read Post | CommentsDoug Bandow, 11/15/12Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe most important vote on November 6 was not reelecting Barack Obama as president. It was legalizing marijuana in Colorado and Washington. The fight over drug policy will go on for a long time. But the Drug War is ending.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 11/14/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027If Republicans won\u0027t budge on raising tax rates but insist on broadening the base, Democrats should take aim at the biggest tax loophole of all for America\u0027s wealthy: the preference for capital gains. Capital gains should be taxed the same as ordinary income.Read Post | Comments (230)Jonathan Weiler, 11/14/12Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillIn too many ways, the GOP of 2012 could not plausibly deny that which has become too plain to ignore -- that it is the part of antipathy to difference and social change.Read Post | Comments (138)Ann Brenoff, 11/14/12Senior Writer, The Huffington PostNBC reporter Luke Russert, 27, was thrust into the role of Ageism\u0027s poster boy yesterday when he asked Nancy Pelosi for her response to those who \"privately\" (read: behind your back) say her decision to stay on as House minority caucus leader presents a roadblock to \"younger leadership and hurts the party in the long term.\"Read Post | Comments (251)Mark Gongloff, 11/14/12Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostWe know nothing about President Obama\u0027s meeting on Wednesday with CEOs to discuss the fiscal cliff. But we can hope is that it was hostile and unproductive, because the CEOs are hypocrites with terrible ideas.Read Post | Comments (243)Art Brodsky, 11/14/12Internet activist and bloggerHas anyone seen a \"used\" e-book? No. Not a one. Because they don\u0027t exist. Every e-book purchased is a new e-book. The reason for that is that book publishers have come to control the market for e-books in a way that other industries envy.Read Post | Comments (71)Samantha Kemp-Jackson, 11/14/12Parenting writer \u0026 expert, media personality at www.multiplemayhemmamma.com \u0026 senior communications advisor at www.triplem.caWe\u0027ve all heard them. Those annoying phrases that our parents said to us growing up and now that we\u0027re parents ourselves, we\u0027ve decided to inflict them our own kids. The reality is that the true meanings behind these messages that parents tell their kids are often not as straightforward as they appear to be.Read Post | Comments (60)Kevin A.

This is especially true for beginners.Read Post | CommentsDavid Halperin, 11/14/12Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgSurely there is room for private sector innovation in facing the challenge of preparing Americans for careers.

He needs to call in Colin Powell to help him put out the escalating inferno and to restore both credibility and a sense of integrity to the military high command.

In the second term, it is important that President Obama find ways to focus his energies on judicial nominations, and find ways to ensure that the Senate does the same.Read Post | Comments (13)Annette Poizner, 11/12/12Psychotherapist, AuthorIn a world that gives the impression that \"what you see is what you get,\" how can we train ourselves to access more information?

Al Sharpton, 11/14/12President, National Action NetworkThe days ahead will require commitment and tolerance from all of us, but we will not forget why we voted for this President. We will continue to fight for those who may not have a voice, and we will deflect negativity from all sides.
