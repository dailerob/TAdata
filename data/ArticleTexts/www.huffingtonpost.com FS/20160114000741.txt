Will the Republican Party pledge allegiance to this message and to one of these messengers, Donald Trump? If they do so, bringing their nominee within striking distance of winning the White House, what signal will other countries with more tribal histories -– a Germany, a France, a Turkey, a Sweden -- take from America’s failure to live up to its ideals? That is the big question framing the 2016 election, not only for the U.S. but for the world. We know that the world is watching: social media statistics for 2015 show that the U.S. election was the most followed news story on the planet -- and it wasn’t even officially the election year yet.Much of the president\u0027s speech was about the forces of abject bigotry on the current political stage and how we can\u0027t underestimate them.

It is an attempt to finally make their voices heard.Elementary school teacher, Detroit Public SchoolsOnce Bernie wins the Democratic nomination -- the presidency is obviously and undoubtedly his on a platter.British-born, Hollywood-based humorist, commentator, producer and radio hostOn Thursday, Liberia will be declared \"Ebola-free\" by the World Health Organization, joining Sierra Leone and Guinea -- signaling an end to the Ebola epidemic. What did we learn?White House Ebola Response Coordinator from October 2014 through February 2015There are rules for issuing and securitizing mortgages. These rules were completely ignored in the peak years of the housing bubble. At every step, there were people who knew they were not following the law, but thought it would not matter.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I came away with so many things from Bowie.

By driving down the global price of oil, the Kingdom is risking the future of its regime.Investment professional and author, \"The Fall of Telecom\"In total, this was by far the most climate hawkish State of the Union ever, and that\u0027s important progress. But I have two wishes for future addresses.Founder, Winston Eco-Strategies; Author, \"The Big Pivot\" and co-author, \"Green to Gold\"I believe if we can integrate these messages into our cultural narratives, we can reshape our society\u0027s sexual focus from that of negation to that of consent and mutual respect. Boys will grow up actively soliciting consensual language, and girls will feel comfortable actively providing it.Activist, journalist, screenwriter, and every day sociologistSitting to clear your mind is an excellent barometer of physical and mental health. It was sad to realize I could not even sit still for 10 minutes. I recommend meditation to anyone who needs a reminder that to be more effective at work, they need to slow down.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostA really funny thing has happened over the course of President Obama\u0027s two-term tenure. In many ways, he has in effect out-Jesused many of his Conservative Christian critics.Pastor and WriterI\u0027m about as liberal as they come, vote in every election (even the tiny local ones), and almost always cast a straight-ticket Democratic ballot.

As of yesterday, I\u0027ve been on this earth for more than 23 years, and I think it\u0027s about time for me to be engaged. But I don\u0027t mean I\u0027m looking for a fiancé. I\u0027m as single as a slice of American cheese right now.Volunteer, A Christian Ministry in the National ParksIn his State of the Union, President Obama called for \"reducing the influence of money in our politics.\" Fantastic. He has heard the growing cry of the 85 percent of us who want big changes (with almost half of us wanting a complete rebuild!) in how America funds elections.Author, \u0027Diet for a Small Planet\u0027Dear Senator Sanders, Your popularity depends on the support of young voters.

I know. His dad was/is a pastor and he\u0027s a Christian. Surely, Ted has read a least some of it at some point in his life, right? Maybe... and maybe not.Writer, Blogger, \u0026 SpeakerIn December a Utah couple created a dating website called \"Where White People Meet.\" The founder stated that they created the site because there are dating websites for every other race and creed out there, so why not one specifically catering to white people?Blogger at That\u0027s InappropriateWhat if your most pressing need was simply to bring your female body back to life?
