{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Alissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgOn the one-year anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, I have reflected a lot about what it means to me. It has been one year since I saw my sweet little Emilie. I will be honest, I hate when the media comes into town. I don\u0027t like seeing their vans with large satellite dishes parked on every corner. I don\u0027t like reporters bothering me to comment or give interviews about the \"latest\" findings with the case. I don\u0027t like seeing my daughter\u0027s picture on the news associated with her violent death. And I really don\u0027t like talking about the anniversary of the shooting. So, I choose to turn it all off. I choose to reflect on what I have learned about myself and my journey through grief.Comments (26)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureFederal workers will be expected to subsidize this deal with an increase in their out-of-pocket pension costs.
