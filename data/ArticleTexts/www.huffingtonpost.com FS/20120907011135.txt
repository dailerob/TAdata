{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Exit Interview\u0027; Former President, ABC NewsConsidering that facts are always true, it\u0027s surprising how often they can deceive us. That\u0027s why all the fighting between the presidential campaigns over the facts and whether they\u0027re being manipulated to mislead is much, much more than just petty politics. Thankfully, at least for the moment, we\u0027ve come light-years from being trapped in a fiction that \"fair and balanced\" is the best way to cover all the serious issues of the day. Sometimes there is a right answer, and we need people in the media to have the courage to call some balls and strikes as our leaders and those around them are throwing fastballs and curves at us.Read Post | Comments (31)Patton Oswalt, 09/06/12Comedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesNothing wrong with being rich. Nothing wrong with striving and bettering yourself. But there\u0027s definitely something wrong with people confusing capitalism and corporatism (the latter wants to destroy the former) -- and then demanding everyone else make the same mistake.Read Post | Comments (333)Bob Cesca, 09/06/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerThe contrast between a strong Democratic Party and a flaky, unstable, flip-floppy Republican Party has prompted the GOP to spend the week whining and pooping their big boy pants about how the Democrats are being so mean.Read Post | Comments (618)Roseanne Barr, 09/06/12ActressCampaign Finance Reform may not sound like a burning, hot-button issue, but it is, and all of us citizens better get united behind that, or pretty soon there won\u0027t be anything left worth fighting for. That\u0027s why I\u0027m running for president and that\u0027s why I approved this message.Read Post | Comments (297)Chez Pazienza, 09/06/12Co-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentSo you\u0027re never going to believe this, but Jason Biggs, the kid who made himself famous by pretending to have sex with a pie, apparently has a really crude sense of humor and a filthy mouth to go with it.Read Post | CommentsElisabeth MacNamara, 09/06/12President, League of Women Voters of the United StatesThe growing influence of money in politics threatens to corrupt our representative form of government, where the people -- through their votes -- are supposed to make the decisions.Read Post | Comments (21)Dan Glickman, 09/06/12Vice President and Exec. Director of the Congressional Program, Aspen Institute; Senior Fellow, Bipartisan Policy Center.The skyrocketing amount of money in politics is destroying the ability of public servants to do their jobs.
