{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna Huffington\"UK population\u0027s happiness is on the up,\" trumpeted a headline in The Guardian. What the headline was referring to are the results of a survey conducted by the Office for National Statistics meant to measure Britain\u0027s national well-being. The program was announced in 2010 by David Cameron, with the first report coming in 2012 and the second this past week. While the idea of measuring a country\u0027s well-being by something other than just its GDP is certainly important and can lead to a really worthwhile conversation, the question is how the alternative index is compiled and how it correlates with other data on health and well-being. I\u0027m solidly behind any effort to show that we\u0027re more than just our marginal contribution to our bank account, the bottom line of our employer or the gross national product of our country. But it\u0027s important to look at the whole picture.Comments (63)Keith BarryMagicianThe power of hypnosis is a constant source of debate. My own research and the fact that I have now hypnotized over 3,000 people give me a unique and personal view of how the brain functions subconsciously.Comments (113)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe ugly truth about Russia\u0027s law against gay \"propaganda,\" now the subject of worldwide protests and boycotts, is coming into view. And that includes the role of American companies sponsoring the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, as well that of the International Olympic Committee.Comments (116)Anne TheriaultFeminist bloggerYou are a bad person who deserves bad things. You are unhappy because you are lazy or lacking in willpower. Your family and friends do not love you. Everyone deserves better than you. Everything is your fault. There is no cure for your sadness.Comments (309)Seth ShulmanSenior Staff Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsWhile Koch-funded groups like AFP are unlikely to heed the message anytime soon, there is every indication in the solar energy field that the political terrain is starting to shift dramatically.Comments (670)Ryan BuxtonEditorial fellow, HuffPost LiveI always assumed the years of hiding my truth from my dad didn\u0027t matter, that once I came out to him we\u0027d have all the time in the world to reconcile our opposing viewpoints. Instead, closure was another thing we didn\u0027t get to share.Comments (28)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Zach Carter and Jason Cherkis look at the 30-year tenure of Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Gregory Beyer and Catherine Pearson examine how the rising average retirement age is prompting more and more individuals and companies to prioritize well-being, and Carolyn Gregoire looks at the lasting effects of stress on one particular demographic: men.CommentsBenjamin Todd JealousPresident and CEO, NAACPRemember the March on Washington? August 28, 1963. Tens of thousands of activists on the National Mall. A preacher\u0027s son from Atlanta talking about his dream for the country. We don\u0027t need to watch a rerun of that fateful day. We need a sequel.Comments (58)Beth WoolseyWriter, humorist at the Five Kids Is A Lot of Kids blogWe all know the old adage \"never pee into the wind,\" but there are some additional, quality, \"how to\" ideas about peeing that are not, apparently, self-evident. For those times, here are 15 rules for peeing.Comments (81)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhy haven\u0027t any bankers gone to jail? What\u0027s going on in this country? Here are seven things about Wall Street crime and Washington \"justice\" you might have wanted to know, but were probably too depressed to ask.Comments (429)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostWhat\u0027s $1.5 trillion? Well, even if you reduce the figure to take into account inflation, it\u0027s enough to cover any estimate of the outstanding student loan debt in America or patch up much of the nation\u0027s aging infrastructure.Comments (33)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistImagine a woman public official, spicing up her business trip with a rendezvous with her favorite male prostitute. Would a confession help? Would a vow of rehab do the trick? Not on your life. Scarlet A\u0027s would be tattooed on their foreheads.Comments (120)Katja BroseEditor, \u0027Neuron\u0027; Executive Editor for \u0027Neuroscience\u0027, Cell PressThe more interesting question is, if neuroscience can explain magic, can magic teach us anything about neuroscience?CommentsSharda SekaranManaging Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceDr. Sanjay Gupta is making waves for his recent reversal of opinion on medical marijuana. Part of this has to do with an expansive body of medical evidence but the touching story of a 5-year-old girl may have also played a meaningful role.Comments (17)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhen opponents talk about who\u0027s earning the minimum wage, they\u0027re often referring to the demographics of those at today\u0027s minimum. But that\u0027s not the relevant sample when you\u0027re evaluating a proposed increase in the wage floor.Comments (71)Daphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstPresident Obama, at his pre-vacation press conference Friday, promised more \"transparency\" on U.S. government surveillance programs. But he made no mention of the need for more information about who our government is secretly killing abroad.Comments (14)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundGrowing up poor, Black, and bright in the Bronx without guidance, by the time Darryl Briggs got to high school he already felt completely ignored, almost invisible. None of the teachers noticed his potential and need for academic challenges, or even noticed him at all.CommentsJaleh BisharatVice President of Marketing, oDeskIt used to be that you attended university and then you went to work. Now, the demand for skills is changing fast. No matter how experienced you are, you need to be nimble.Comments (17)Stephen KesslerDirector, \u0027Paul Williams Still Alive\u0027There will be many articles devoted to the work Karen Black did, so this one will be dedicated to talking about what a wonderful person she was.CommentsKevin McDonoughSyndicated columnist and television criticBefore GOP chairman Reince Priebus started criticizing NBC for announcing its Hillary miniseries project, maybe he should have asked himself, \"What would Ronald Reagan Do?\"Comments (15)Emily Atkinson2012 Millennial Values Fellow, The Berkley Center at Georgetown UniversityI was furious, and I couldn\u0027t quite articulate exactly what had set me off. The patently false notion that everything used to be great all the time? The persistence of American exceptionalism? The accusation that I, at 22, am part of the worst generation ever?Comments (59)Holly RobinsonAuthor, THE WISHING HILLEach of us desperately hopes, in some dark secret corner of our hearts, that there really is such a thing as second sight or voodoo magic. This isn\u0027t only because we love to be entertained, but because we long to be transported into other worlds.CommentsClaire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWhat makes a book chick lit as opposed to literary fiction? This question is, in reality, not difficult to answer -- at least for any thoughtful reader who enjoys a variety of fiction -- but it continues to surface.Comments (58)Rohit WanchooCo-founder, GiveDirectlyWhy aren\u0027t more nonprofits giving cash instead of traditional aid? Until recently, we didn\u0027t have the data to show how effective cash transfers can be. We also never had the technology to transfer cash to the poor cheaply and reliably.CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegePresident Obama has already fired Ed DeMarco, acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), but before he leaves DeMarco is handing an early Christmas present to his friends in the banking industry.Comments (48)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsSo when Congress comes back in session in September, what difference will the millions of dollars spent on dueling ads aimed at moms make? It could move millions of moms more firmly into the pro-Obamacare camp.Comments (430)Emma GrayEditor, HuffPost WomenWe are already subjected to enough insane coverage about famous women\u0027s fluctuating weights, slim-down \"tricks\" and \"bikini bodies.\" Please leave Hillary Clinton\u0027s political campaign out of it.Comments (168)Clark HowardTalk Radio Host, AuthorStudent loans are a backbreaking burden on many people in this country both young and old. Collectively, our borrowing for education is nearing $1 trillion. I believe it\u0027s the next debt bubble to burst.Comments (20)Hulu.comWatchers of Good TVIt\u0027s indisputable that as a society, we\u0027re pretty messed up. Gun violence and global warming aside, most of us cannot even manage to bring our shopping carts back to the designated space in a parking lot.Comments (76)Lynn ParramoreAlterNet Editor; Co-founder, Recessionwire; Founding Editor of New Deal 2.0Before dismissing a man who made a mistake five years ago, women should look at the total record and the whole person before deciding if Eliot Spitzer is a candidate worth supporting.Comments (286)Kyle KoeppelFounder, www.mutantblogger.comI personally would not select out or abort a fetus because it tested positive for Lynch Syndrome. I find it ironic that a living person has to wait until the age of 18 to have genetic testing, but an unborn child\u0027s parents can determine whether or not the child has Lynch Syndrome before birth.Comments (13)Janet Weinberg, 2013. 9.08NewYorkdotcom, 2013. 9.08Joe Mirabella, 2013. 9.08Megan Evans, 2013. 9.08Margaret Singer, 2013. 9.08Rev.
