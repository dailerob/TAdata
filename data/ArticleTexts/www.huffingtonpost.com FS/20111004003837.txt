{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I am delighted to announce four new additions to the Huffington Post. Huff/Post50 covers the challenges, complexities, and joys faced by those of us who are part of the so-called \"baby boom\" generation, while HuffPost High School (launching tomorrow) is devoted to teens and the issues they care about -- everything from college prep to high school sports to proms and beyond. HuffPost has long covered LGBT news and opinion; HuffPost Gay Voices provides a platform for all these stories to live in one place -- making it easier for readers to find, share, and discuss them. And since we\u0027ve always done things unconventionally at HuffPost, one year after launching our popular Divorce site, we\u0027ve decided to bring you the latest news and opinion on getting -- and staying -- married: HuffPost Weddings. These four sections are part of our continued effort to provide content, community, and a platform for self-expression for as many of our readers\u0027 interests and passions as we can.Read Post | Comments (28)Rita Wilson, 10/3/11Editor at Large, Huff/Post50Many of you are looking to your future and creating a vision for the next few decades. Whether your future is Calgon clear or as grey as the hair you dye, life for Post50 Boomers is probably nothing like what your parents\u0027 was.Read Post | Comments (179)Jeffrey Sachs, 10/3/11Director, the Earth Institute, Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027Congressman Ryan describes my book as anti-American in its values. He is wrong: my book describes how we can restore politics to the true mainstream, rescuing democracy from the clutches of corporate power that Ryan champions in deeds if not in words.Read Post | Comments (83)Catherine Crier, 10/3/11journalist, former judge, author-Patriot ActsToday, Adam Smith\u0027s Wealth of Nations is considered a Bible for capitalism, but when published in 1776, it was a blasphemous challenge to the big business, big government mercantilism in Europe.Read Post | Comments (47)Bill Maher, 10/3/11Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"The thing about your fifties is, you\u0027re not nearly over -- in fact, lots of ambitious people are peaking -- but it is the first time in your life that you can see over the crest of the mountain and down into the Valley below -- you know, Death.Read Post | Comments (706)Dylan Ratigan, 10/3/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027While our healthcare, educational, banking, military, energy, trade and tax policies all have great room for improvement, I believe that the events of the past few years make it clear that until we get money out of our political system, we cannot begin on any of it.Read Post | Comments (103)Dan Collins, 10/3/11New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostThe more the N.J. governor flirts with a presidential race, the worse the whole idea looks. Reports that Christie is considering a run come from a political brain trust that appears to be made up mainly of the folks who ran Rudy Giuliani\u0027s campaign four years ago.Read Post | CommentsJeff Jarvis, 10/3/11Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027, \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027I don\u0027t think #OccupyWallStreet is or should be about just venting anger or demonizing business or complaining or demanding. Indeed, of whom are we making these demands? The failed institutions?Read Post | Comments (11)Dean Baker, 10/3/11Co-Director of CEPR and author of The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets ProgressivePlease, President Clinton, save some trees. Don\u0027t give a half-baked lecture on the virtues of deficit reduction. It is not what the country needs.Read Post | CommentsCarolyn Espley-Miller, 10/3/11Designer; Creative Consultant; Lifestyle Blogger, SlimPaley.comDo not expect your kids to comment on your blog. You have about as much chance of finding a comment from them in your mailbox as drink coasters in their dorm rooms.Read Post | Comments (36)Rep. Dennis Kucinich, 10/3/11U.S. Representative from Ohio\u0027s 10th DistrictUnfortunately, the proposed free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama do nothing to address the significant flaws in the free trade model that prioritize the rights of multinational companies over the rights of workers and the American economy.Read Post | CommentsChristiane Amanpour, 10/3/11Anchor, \u0027This Week with Christiane Amanpour\u0027Love what you do in order to be good at it. Make sure to maintain the purpose and sense of mission. That is an eternal truth, but the older I get, the more urgent it becomes. Like many I miss my hormones, but I do think being older brings the gift of wisdom.Read Post | Comments (21)Marty Kaplan, 10/3/11Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolWithout campaign finance reform, the future belongs to the big dogs in the money game. I wish Occupy Wall Street would connect the dots between whatever their issues are and the mother of all issues.Read Post | Comments (27)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 10/3/11CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAre markets stuck in an irrational cycle of self-feeding fear? Is the volatility, including eye-popping intra-day swings, just a head fake? As much as I would like to say yes the answer is no. The system is sending signals rather than making noise.Read Post | Comments (12)Robert Kuttner, 10/2/11Co-founder and co-editor, The American ProspectThe Wall Street protests are heartening -- but also a measure of the utter failure of the usual machinery of democracy to remedy the worst pillaging of regular Americans by financial elites since the 1920s.Read Post | Comments (285)Lloyd I. Sederer, MD, 10/3/11Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthAny sport: golf, tennis, baseball, football, basketball, soccer, hockey, skiing, no matter. Unless you guessed Esther Vergeer you are wrong.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 10/3/11Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027I keep hearing about authenticity. It seems to be the go-to description for all who would be bonafide; a self-sticking seal signifying that what you see is what you get, and what you get is worthy.Read Post | Comments (10)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 10/3/11Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe fact that the movement doesn\u0027t make demands of Wall Street -- or Washington, for that matter -- doesn\u0027t mean it doesn\u0027t have demands. It does, but they\u0027re not directed at Wall Street, or K Street, or Pennsylvania Avenue. They\u0027re directed at you.Read Post | Comments (13)Chris Weigant, 10/3/11Political Writer and Blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAbbie Hoffman\u0027s merry band of pranksters took a tour of the NYSE on August 24, 1967. The tour ended at a gallery overlooking the trading floor. Hoffman and his friends rushed to the railing, and began throwing money onto the heads of the traders below.Read Post | CommentsJosh Silver, 10/2/11CEO, Democracy FundAmericans from the right and left must abandon the polarizing rhetoric from our leaders and our TV screens, and join hands in support of a 21st century democracy reform agenda that reclaims our government from moneyed special interests.Read Post | Comments (480)Geoffrey R.

But I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ll need more than marches to get jobs back.Read Post | Comments (515)Margaret Cho, 10/3/11Comedian, actor and recording artistI don\u0027t know why it\u0027s a difficult concept to understand. Most of the people I know have had sex with more than one person, and many have sex outside marriage. I just happen to have had it with people all along the gender scale.Read Post | Comments (58)Adam Winkler, 10/3/11Professor of Law, UCLAThe NRA used to be far more open-minded on gun control and, amazingly, paid almost no attention whatsoever to the Second Amendment.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 2011.10.03Jason Salzman, 2011.10.03Miranda Levenstein, 2011.10.03Bill Ong Hing, 2011.10.03Jon Chattman, 2011.10.03Andy Ross, 2011.10.03Max Atkinson, 2011.10.03Baroness Mary Goudie, 2011.10.03Olivia Rose, 2011.10.03Helen Lederer, 2011.10.03Marimekko","h1":"Using a mobile device?
