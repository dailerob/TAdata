{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Remember \"Peak Oil?\" The world was running out of oil, prices would soon skyrocket, and we had better find other fuels. Well, that argument didn\u0027t work out so well for environmentalists, did it? As oil reserves and those of other carbon fuels became scarce and prices rose, the law of supply and demand kicked in. The industry invested the profits from those higher prices in new technologies, and the oil barons found even more destructive ways to extract oil and gas -- by exploiting the muck from tar sands, inventing hydro-fracking, and despoiling Third World sources. So now, oil is cheaper than it\u0027s been in years, about $66 a barrel. Regular unleaded gasoline can be had for well under $3 a gallon. One of the few things sustaining U.S. consumer purchasing power in the face of dismal wages is close to $100 billion saved in energy costs. OPEC\u0027s pricing power has been broken and the United States is about to surpass Saudi Arabia as the world\u0027s largest oil producer. Whoopee, energy self-sufficiency! Take that, enviro-pessimists.Opposition to Obama\u0027s Net Neutrality statement has come from unlikely bedfellows ranging from Sen. Ted Cruz to Rev. Jesse Jackson. With so much nonsense, the editors of our most established newspapers have stepped into the fray to set the record straight. Well, not exactly.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressEnriching the informational base of democracy and making greater use of interactive public reasoning can contribute significantly to making democracy more workable, and also allow reasoned assessment of social welfare.Nobel Laureate Economic SciencesIn most industries, the surest way to create major and lasting value is not through market share, but by expanding or creating new markets. That\u0027s what women are doing to the stats by starting their own businesses.Director on the boards of Berkshire Hathaway, Costco Wholesale, and Intel Corporation; Trustee on the board of Save the Children; Advisor to Hampton CreekYes, it\u0027s that time of year again. Online shoppers will spend countless hours in front of their computer screens to get the best Cyber Monday deals. If you don\u0027t like waiting in long lines, this may be your only chance to get those holiday shopping discounts.AuthorChange is undeniably hard. Progress is not an exercise in expediency. But if you are committed, then you will understand that you have no choice but to keep going not to see if you will win, but until you win.President, National Action NetworkThe long-term deterioration of the middle class, accelerated by the Wall Street crash of 2008, has not been pretty. Today, we have more wealth and income inequality than any major country on earth.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontThe administration appears to have lost its collective mind. The president has added ground forces to the battle in Iraq and the military has suggested introducing thousands more. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel might be lucky having been left at the curb.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe boundary separating white Anglo upscale school districts from the burgeoning non-white and non-Anglo populations in downscale communities is fast becoming a flashpoint inside America.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The weight loss journey begins -- and much of the battle is won -- when you believe you deserve that end game and can see the finish line with clarity. Can you envision what life will be like when your clothes finally fit comfortably? How will it feel when you chase after the kids in the park without getting breathless?Once you\u0027ve got what I call \"20/20 foresight,\" then you have a better chance of following that vision all the way to reality with the tools I\u0027m about to give you.Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"No matter how \"respectable\" we are or become, as long as our skin is Black we will never amount to white standards though we are expected to be a reflection of them. Respectability will never be a solution because the issue isn\u0027t us; it\u0027s how white America views blackness.Journalist. Storyteller. Wordsmith. Tar Heel. Black Feminist. In no particular order.This week, the Supreme Court will consider a case that could limit pregnant women\u0027s options to protect themselves from discrimination. As a lawyer who works on these cases, I\u0027ll be watching the case closely. If you\u0027re interested in the rights of pregnant women, you should tune in on Dec. 3 too.Founder, The Spiggle Law FirmThe emergence of this deadly, mysterious disease tested us like never before. In many ways, we as a society failed that test.Governor of New YorkAs Republican pressure grows on a beleaguered president to become even more militarily assertive on a range of global issues from the Ukraine to the Levant, we all need to ask ourselves a few questions.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsMany Democrats examining what happened in the 2014 midterms are asking, \"What did the voters want?\" But the right question is why only 36.4 percent of potential voters bothered to register and vote? Obviously Democrats did not give those voters a good enough reason to take the trouble. Is the Democratic Party relevant anymore?Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureMy 24-year-old daughter lives in Jerusalem. It\u0027s not a large city, so anything that happens in Jerusalem, is too close for comfort in this mother\u0027s eyes. I am not a staunch pro-Israel supporter, as many expect I might be. However, this was wrong on all levels. This is black and white for me: this was terrorism.Writer, hiker, daydreamer and lover of sushiThis week I point to the changing skyline of Manhattan as the physical embodiment of how money and power impact the lives and neighborhoods of everyday people.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyEbola scares. Antivaccination fads. Rampant obesity. Never has the U.S. been in more urgent need of a Surgeon General. The current nominee, Dr. Murthy, is an outstanding candidate who should have been approved and in place months ago to deal with these urgent challenges. Unfortunately, Congress refuses to take action.Author, \u0027The Color of Atmosphere: One Doctor\u0027s Journey In and Out of Medicine\u0027Because of the great social implications of cases involving police shootings of people of color, the presumption in these cases should be that prosecutors utilize the public preliminary hearing process instead of the secret grand jury proceeding.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of Lawgrr·yo [gree-oh, gree-yoh] noun : An international collective of mobile and social artists : www.grryo.comI will continue to be a feminist and a reader of Seventeen, Cosmo, and company -- not because it\u0027s perfect, but because it\u0027s me.WriterA Saudi Arabia that has failed to open up its political system, that has failed to improve the lot of its people, which has fought the wrong wars, and that has poured all its energies in trying to crush the only real antidote to Takfiri Islam, and that harbors thousands of willing carriers of the black flags of the IS, is vulnerable indeed.Editor, Middle East EyeRunaway inequality is destroying the American Dream. Is it too late to save it? That depends on what is really driving inequality. In the 1960s the gap between CEOs and the average worker was 20 to 1. By 2012 it was 354 to 1. What happened?Author, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)I hesitate to say \"lost to AIDS\" because the term is too benign -- as if, like car keys or cell phones, people are \"lost\" randomly and accidentally to a disease. No, AIDS patients are killed by disease abetted by stigma, their immune systems compromised and vulnerable to opportunistic infections.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusOne of the things I learned fairly early on in life is that the fastest way to future rewards is by following present joy. Even when that doesn\u0027t seem to be true, acting from a centered, joyful place on a daily basis inside ensures that worst case, you are really enjoying your days.Transformative coach; Best-selling authorThere\u0027s a new date to put on your holiday calendar -- Giving Tuesday, the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving. Introduced in 2012 as an international day of charitable giving, the idea behind Giving Tuesday is to channel some of the spending energy that flows around Black Friday and Cyber Monday into giving energy.President, Charles Schwab FoundationThe mandate that you must have children to be a \"real woman\" is completely false, but you are real. How could anyone ever tell you otherwise?Writer, comedian, mom. http://girlonsaturday.blogspot.comSolar energy access in the United States varies wildly from state to state. Texas gets enough sunlight per year to power the entire world via solar energy, and yet has one of the lowest solar capacities in the country. At the heart of it is state-level regulatory policy.Writer \u0026 BloggerI know there\u0027s a big wide world spinning around us filled with famine and war and suffering and poverty, and real problems. But that didn\u0027t stop me from turning into a living, breathing cliché as I stood there in the middle of our suburban street while out for a walk with my daughter, sobbing uncontrollably because my cat died.Author of \"The Bitch\u0027s Bridal Bible: The Must-Have, Real-Deal Guide for Brides,\" Freelance Writer, Blogger at PunkWife.com.President Obama\u0027s recent speech fits a historic and racist framework through which we can describe the exclusion and banishment of people with felonies who are detained and deported. Even while some parents of citizens will be eligible for relief, parents with felonies and their families will remain vulnerable.Executive Director, Families For FreedomJason Crandell released this video last week, talking about his childhood interest in the human condition, his discovery of yoga (shocking spoiler: it was to get credits to graduate), and the office work element of being a yoga teacher.Vice President, Head of Business Development, The Huffington PostGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"ANY TAKERS?...",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
