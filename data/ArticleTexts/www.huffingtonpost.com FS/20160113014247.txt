{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, The Greenlining InstituteThese addresses often have an optimistic spin, and particularly so as a president nears the end of his term and seeks to cement his legacy, so let me say a few things that Mr. Obama surely knows but may be reluctant to put into words. For Americans of all colors, the state of our union is not good, both economically and politically. Officially, the U.S. economy has been in recovery since 2009, when our GDP stopped shrinking and started growing. But for the majority of working Americans it doesn\u0027t feel like a recovery when wages are stagnant and a growing number of jobs are part-time, temporary or otherwise insecure. It\u0027s even worse for communities of color, the nation\u0027s fastest growing groups.The inescapable essence of birtherism is that Obama is not merely wrong on the issues, but an illegitimate president, a stranger who, by virtue of his origins, is uniquely undeserving of the decent respect otherwise due his office. Now let us contemplate the current treatment of that would-be president and child of Canada, Ted Cruz.Novelist and contributing opinion writerFree expression has not been stifled at Yale. We are functioning just the way a collegiate community should in attending to these challenges. Having surfaced important differences in experience and perspective, our campus community is searching in good faith for ways to recognize and address them.President of Yale UniversityAs President Obama prepares for his final State of the Union address tonight, there\u0027s one critical issue he has neglected over the last few years that bears revisiting: the nuclear threat, which -- along with climate change -- poses the biggest risk to the future of the planet.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsAs 2015 drew to a close, many in the global energy industry were praying that the price of oil would bounce back from the abyss, restoring the petroleum-centric world of the past half-century. All evidence, however, points to a continuing depression in oil prices in 2016 -- one that may, in fact, stretch into the 2020s and beyond.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeCrossing the U.S. border into another country to purchase a child for sex carries with it serious, automatic federal penalties. So why, why, why do we not treat this crime the same way for our children here at home?ActressTwitter users in Mexico accused authorities of using the much-publicized chase, not to mention the bizarre Sean Penn interview, to distract the media from social and economic ills plaguing their country.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.Erdogan\u0027s crackdown on political rivals coupled with a disproportionate number of bombings at Kurdish rallies and other parties makes you wonder what\u0027s really going on.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaDays after reports that Iran has dismantled one of the most dangerous parts of its program by removing the core of its heavy-water reactor in Arak and filling it with cement, Republicans are mounting a new attempt to kill the agreement that has already made the world much safer.Author, \u0027Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\u0027On January 17, 2014, my hair and my head were in rough shape. I would say that about half of my hair was gone. After ten years of struggling with trichotillomania, I had reached a breaking point. The evening before, I had begged my father through tears to get his electric razor and shave all my hair off. My scalp burned and itched, my hands shook with the need to pull out whatever was remaining. Mom and dad gave excellent council and told me to sleep, and to make my final decision after my (VERY timely) therapy appointment the next day. After my appointment, I had made my choice.Mental Health AdvocateThe truth is that asylum seekers hailing from the Northern Triangle of Central America are fleeing circumstances far more atrocious -- and more hopeless -- than a perilous north-bound journey to the U.S. As the poet Warsan Shire said of another group of refugees, \"no one puts their children in a boat unless the water is safer than the land.\"Executive Director, ACLU of TexasWhere are the David Bowies in our modern society? Where are the people in positions of power who look beyond themselves and say, \"I want to hear from those who don\u0027t look/act/think like me\"?Actor, writer, director and hand-talkerNow, as the President gives his final State of the Union and prepares for his last year in office, the question remains: which path will he take? Will he continue to act in the way he did on Keystone XL, standing up to Big Oil and turning down projects that endanger the climate and our communities? Or will the President backslide to the Obama we saw in Cushing and continue to promote fossil fuel development, leaving a legacy full of contradictions and half-measures?Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgPaul Ryan took the speakership vowing to decentralize power and re-energize House committees. It\u0027s a noble cause, but it\u0027s fair to ask that in return, the committees serve as open forums that do serious policy analysis, not just legislative sausage-making. On criminal justice, Ryan has a chance to establish that principle.Criminal justice \u0026 politicsThe only thing that will loosen the NRA\u0027s grip on Congress and state capitols are leaders who are unafraid to act in the interest of public safety and support stronger gun laws. Our most powerful weapon is to create a voting base of even greater size and influence that will vote on a single issue: gun sense.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaI vehemently oppose Big Government and Nanny State regulation, but also have no use for guns, find hunting distasteful and wish that James Madison had never dreamed up the Second Amendment while politicking for the Constitution.Author, \u0027The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America\u0027There are the 75 million kids under 18 who cannot vote, but who will live for the rest of this century in a world largely determined by decisions made now. And most of these decisions have to do with science. Nothing will change the future as much -- and the the public knows it.Writer/director, \u0027The Ledge\u0027; Author, Trials of the Monkey\u0027; President, ScienceDebate.orgAt 45 years old I\u0027m still running and sweating just to survive. Recently I was forced to move into a two bedroom house that I have to share with my two sons and my daughter, simply because I can\u0027t afford anything larger. I am gearing up to start a second job, but even that won\u0027t be enough.Awards created in conjunction with the upcoming release of Michael Moore\u0027s new movie Where To Invade NextTo exchange accusations and call each other the root cause of the chaos that plagues the Middle East is to deflect responsibility for the despair that is inundating the crisis-stricken region.Award-winning Iranian journalist and writer covering foreign relations, politics, culture, religion and everything Iran!No, adopting a black child is not an opportunity to prove you\u0027re not racist or be heralded for wanting the undesirable and loving the unlovable. It means understanding and accepting that despite the notion of race as a purely social construct, there are physical differences between us.Writer, know-it-all, goofball, revolutionary!Into the Schindler House, sacred to modernist architecture, came Brennan Gerard and Ryan Kelly and the LA Dance Project. The choreography, organized around the theme of time, the clock and domesticity is wholly analogous to the original architectural concept, since Schindler based the house on a \"pinwheel\" plan. \"Everyone has an internal clock,\" says Kelly. \"What does 12 feel like to you?\"Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnWhy has Wall Street been pushing its lie, blaming the government for what happened? And why has the Street (along with its right-wing apologists, and its outlets such as Rupert Murdoch\u0027s Wall Street Journal) so viciously attacked the movie The Big Short?Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027\"Do what you love and you\u0027ll never work a day in your life.\" It sounds like good advice when someone asks you how to be happy in their career. It\u0027s also total bullsh*t. Doing what you love is going to be hard. But that doesn\u0027t mean you shouldn\u0027t do it.Entrepreneur, comedian \u0026 writer.Interpretations of law, whether religious or secular, are always influenced by specific historical and cultural contexts. To drive this point home, I asked my students to reflect on the mindset that has developed in America after Sept. 11, which is comparable to the one during the Mamluk period. In such crisis-ridden circumstances, ordinarily peace-loving people will clamor for military retaliation against a ruthless violent enemy that threatens to annihilate them.Professor, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Indiana UniversityDavid Bowie did not die. Don\u0027t believe what you\u0027ve heard. Kill the messenger. Burn the newspapers and magazines. Yell out your window. David Bowie is alive. So alive, and he will live forever.Actor, Best Selling Author, and 2016 Grammy Nominated ComedianRock and roll in general, and David Bowie, in particular, helped me transition out of the hypocritical society where my parents dwelled. I got into Bowie around the same time I started questioning the upper class Iranian society of the seventies.Iranian-American essayistThis speech will be less of a to-do list and more of a greatest hits tour of Obama\u0027s presidency. But it\u0027s still an election year. And the president would really like to pass the torch to a Democrat. So if it feels kinda like a campaign speech, that\u0027s because it is.theSkimm makes it easier to be smarter. We read. You Skimm.
