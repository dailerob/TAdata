{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIODuring his acceptance speech, John McCain had some very strong criticism of his opponent. I\u0027m not talking about Barack Obama; I\u0027m talking about George Bush. After rushing headlong into the embrace of Bush and the Rovian wing of the GOP, McCain has now decided that he desperately needs to distance himself and try to reclaim the maverick mantel. Not an easy thing to do when you have sided with Bush 90 percent of the time. But McCain gave it his best shot, claiming: \"We need to change the way government does almost everything.\" Listening to the speech, you\u0027d think it was the Democrats who occupied the White House the last seven-plus years and it was time to throw the bastards out.Read Post | CommentsBIOJacob Heilbrunn, 09.04.2008Most of McCain\u0027s speech was a snooze, delivered in the tone of a kindly old uncle reminiscing about World War II before fretting about how how those pesky Russians are stirring up trouble again.Read Post | Comments (15)BIOSteve Clemons, 09.04.2008Tonight, McCain gave us a big dose of Reagan\u0027s national greatness flourish in a dignified, genteel and pleasant manner. His speaking style was reminiscent of Reagan -- without the memorable lines.Read Post | CommentsBIOJoseph Romm, 09.04.2008McCain has no plan to reduce oil imports -- indeed, throughout his career he has explicitly rejected every plan that might reduce oil imports.Read Post | CommentsBIOBob Cesca, 09.04.2008If an undecided voter responded strongly to the yelling from Mitt, Rudy and Palin, and then watched McCain, they were probably disappointed and let-down by McCain.Read Post | Comments (574)BIOJoseph A. Palermo, 09.04.2008A Republican stalwart who played a key role in implementing the Bush agenda, in his speech tonight, McCain attempted to recast himself as an \"outsider\" eager to clean up the mess he helped create.Read Post | CommentsBIOArianna Huffington, 09.03.2008The GOP is intent on keeping Bush -- and his disastrous legacy -- as far away from McCain and the Republican convention as possible. So we decided to bring a stark reminder of those years to the RNC.Read Post | Comments (240)BIOPaul Abrams, 09.05.2008By being forced to embrace Palin, the Christian right is acknowledging that \"legitimate\" families have morphed into a variety of shapes and forms that all need to be supported and accommodated.Read Post | CommentsBIOAri Melber, 09.05.2008John McCain\u0027s nomination speech was so flat, so disjointed, so utterly devoid of any vision or affirmative plan for the U.S. -- it\u0027s hard to say much about it, other than it sucked.Read Post | CommentsBIORoderick Spencer, 09.04.2008Before it all goes blurry and fictional in the retelling, allow me to recapitulate my personal list of astonishments from Denver.Read Post | CommentsBIONora Ephron, 09.04.2008I forget how white Republicans are, and mean-spirited, and thin-lipped. I watch them and I think, is anyone buying this? Does anyone think we\u0027re better off today? That we\u0027re \"winning\" the war? Does anyone really think that executive experience trumps wisdom and intellect?Read Post | Comments (335)BIOJames P. Rubin, 09.04.2008Just as Republicans attacked John Kerry\u0027s service in Vietnam during the 2004 campaign -- his perceived strong suit -- the RNC is now peddling stories that Biden is weak on foreign affairs.Read Post | Comments (29)BIODavid Bromwich, 09.04.2008Obama can be described as many things: U.S. senator, state senator, organizer, author, teacher of law. For the sake of his campaign, he ought to revert distinctly now to the role of explainer.Read Post | Comments (24)Patricia Zohn, 09.05.2008Scott Kurashige, 09.04.2008John Seery, 09.04.2008Nina Burleigh, 09.04.2008Mara Reinstein, 09.04.2008David Donnelly, 09.04.2008Andy Borowitz, 09.03.2008Linda Hirshman, 09.04.2008Mike Lux, 09.04.2008Jane Smiley, 09.04.2008Seth Greenland, 09.04.2008Steven Weber, 09.04.2008Oliver Willis, 09.04.2008Josh Silver, 09.04.2008Michael Shaw, 09.05.2008Patricia Zohn, 09.05.2008Cenk Uygur, 09.05.2008Craig Crawford, 09.05.2008Steven Weber, 09.05.2008Arianna Huffington, 09.05.2008","h1":"Using a mobile device?
