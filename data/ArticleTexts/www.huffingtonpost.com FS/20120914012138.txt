{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressThe fact that the Romney camp is actually \"exuding confidence\" is a big strategic gambit that could blow up in his face if he simply comes out and puts on a performance that\u0027s worthy of having exuded confidence over in the first place. In the \"expectations game,\" if you express confidence in your debate prep, you will be required to leave your opponent quietly quivering with dampened pants behind the lectern (not the podium ... that\u0027s something everyone should brush up on before the debates), unable to stand or speak under the weight of unbearable shame. This is, of course, stupid. There shouldn\u0027t be anything wrong with Romney saying that he\u0027ll be well-prepared to debate -- he quite literally will be. It\u0027s just that the media need to have something to talk about between now and the debates, and so \"expectations\" it is.Read Post | Comments (1,132)Bob Cesca, 09/13/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerRomney could have been a statesman about the events in North Africa and appeared dignified -- perhaps qualified -- in the process, but instead he decided to be a braying crackpot.

Chris Coons, 09/13/12U.S. Senator from DelawareWhat matters is whether the platform shows an intention to honor God\u0027s call for action that we care for each other as neighbors and work to heal the sick, feed the hungry and protect those in need. The Democratic platform fully embraces those values, but they are hard to find in the Republican platform.Read Post | Comments (138)Michael Hogan, 09/12/12Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupThe seriousness with which Phillips treats Lohan, Lima and Grey prompts a series of uncomfortable questions: Why do I know who these women are?
