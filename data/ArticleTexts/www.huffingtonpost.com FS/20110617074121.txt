Its adolescence was, like most formative years, filled with late nights, video games, loud music, junk food, and trying to figure out exactly what it wanted to be when it grew up. Now, it has matured to the point where our online and our offline lives have merged. Indeed, the qualities we care most about offline are being increasingly reflected in our experience online.
