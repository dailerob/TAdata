{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From wikipedia.orgFrom dagbladet.no/stevegilliard.blogspot.comFrom yahoo.comDon\u0027t shed any tears for Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi. Even though her guy lost, this was still a big win for her. A victory for taking a stand -- and for her leadership. Because that\u0027s what real leaders do, they take stands. They listen to their hearts and follow their gut. If you only jump into the fights you\u0027re sure you can win -- notches in the W column that will look good on your political resume -- you\u0027re a hack, not someone who can move the party and the country forward. It\u0027s not about trying to have a spotless record; it\u0027s about knowing which battles are worth fighting, whatever the outcome.READ POST | comments (125)11.16.2006 Rep.
