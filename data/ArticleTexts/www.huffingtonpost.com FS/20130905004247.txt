{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonAloha! I\u0027m here for the launch of our newest edition, HuffPost Hawaii. We are delighted to be partnering with Honolulu Civil Beat, a beacon of journalism in Hawaii focusing on public affairs and investigative reporting, with deep roots in the local culture. In its three years, Civil Beat has committed itself to the mission of its founder, Pierre Omidyar, and has created a \"a vibrant civic square.\" We couldn\u0027t be happier to be bringing HuffPost to Hawaii -- and I\u0027m not just saying that because of the gorgeous beaches and perfect weather. There is something very special about launching HuffPost in Hawaii at the moment when the Third Metric -- redefining success beyond the first two metrics of money and power -- has become such an important editorial initiative for us. The Aloha spirit, which has made Hawaii such an oasis of unplugging and recharging, is after all the essence of the Third Metric, encapsulating well-being and our ability to wonder and give back.Comments (144)Pierre OmidyarCEO and publisher of Honolulu Civil Beat, Founder of eBayThree months ago we announced Civil Beat\u0027s partnership with the Huffington Post. Today, we are proud to introduce HuffPost Hawaii.CommentsOprah WinfreyChairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkYears ago, my friend and trainer Bob Greene said to me, \"Hawaii is one of the best places on Earth to live.\" I discovered he was right. There\u0027s a reason it\u0027s often called paradise. I am blessed that for at least two months out of the year (working on three) I get to call it home.Comments (46)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comMr. President, our country\u0027s recent history makes it very difficult for you to obtain the world\u0027s approval that we should attack Syria based on any sort of moral authority.Comments (235)James GoodmanAuthor of But Where Is the Lamb? Imagining the Story of Abraham and Isaac.\u0027But where is the lamb?\u0027 I am not sure that there are five more terrifying, or pathetic, words in the Bible.Comments (1,727)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50Before moving to the New York City area, I lived in London for seven years. During that period, I traveled more than two dozen times to France, a place where five- or six-week vacations are the norm and many people retire comfortably at 60 or younger. I made many wonderful French friends and was more than a little awed at the way they aged so gracefully.Comments (303)Senator Brian SchatzU.S. Senator for HawaiiThe partnership between Huffington Post and Civil Beat to create HuffPost Hawaii is good news for our state. A free and open press helps promote debate and is one of the cornerstones of our democracy.CommentsLuis Moreno OcampoFormer Chief Prosecutor, International Criminal CourtThe Syrian conflict offers the world an opportunity: to find an innovative response to establish global order.CommentsJoshua M. BrownAuthor, Backstage Wall StreetWhat led to me beginning CrossFit was a realization that, if left to my own devices, I would never push myself hard enough to truly make the changes I needed to in order to get in shape.CommentsChuck HagelUnited States Secretary of DefenseThe Department of Defense has no more important responsibility than supporting and protecting those who defend our country, and that means we must do everything possible to prevent military suicide. When one of us faces a challenge, we all must stand together.Comments (80)Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee just voted to approve a resolution to attack Syria on a vote of 10-7. But the breakdown of the voting reveals that this was in no way a party-line vote.CommentsLord David OwenFmr. British foreign secretaryIf the proposition to withdraw all chemical weapons were agreed, it would almost certainly be sufficient to bring about an accompanying ceasefire. It would also be an impetus to start the planned conference in Geneva to negotiate a peace settlement.Comments (134)The Second City NetworkFunny words, videos \u0026 make ‘em upsOdds are you\u0027ll be pulling your hair out by Week 3. You can have a really solid draft only to instantly have your season derailed by unpredictable injuries, slumps and murder investigations.CommentsGail BeckerChair, Canada, Latin America \u0026 U.S. Western Region, EdelmanThe year my husband swore off women, was the year that I discovered them. Women were my salvation. They took me out. They bought me drinks. They fed my stomach and my soul.CommentsTamsen FadalJournalist; Author; Co-founder, Shansen JewelryWhile no person or relationship is the same, there are a few signs that are hard to overlook and I wanted to pass them alone.Comments (249)Stephen Henry FoxJournalist, musician, academicEveryone who moves here sings the same refrain, \"I love this place and I\u0027ll never leave.\" For some, this holds true. About six months later, a significant number have changed their tune to \"I will lose my mind if I spend another minute on this god-forsaken rock.\"CommentsFr. Edward L. BeckRoman Catholic PriestIn his 1965 address to the United Nations Pope Paul VI said, \"If you wish to be brothers, let the weapons fall from your hands. One cannot love with offensive weapons in his hands.\" That goes for all weapons.Comments (31)Thomas WilnerFmr. counsel of record for Guantánamo detaineesThere is a myth circulating that, because the president says he wants to close Guantánamo, he would if he could, but that he can\u0027t because Congress has stopped him. That is not so.Comments (47)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorClosing schools does not make them better. Nor does closing schools help students. It\u0027s way past time to stop blaming the people who work in troubled schools and start helping them by providing the tools they need and the support their students need.Comments (579)Julien SmithCEO, Breather1. No Ikea in the world has any reception. If you are inside Ikea, no one outside Ikea can hear you scream. Is your loved one further down in the maze? Or maybe you missed them somehow and they\u0027re behind you? In an Ikea, who f@#$ing knows.CommentsMisty SanicoFreelance writerThe poet Muriel Rukeyser memorably said, \"The universe is made of stories, not atoms.\" We remember things better in the context of an entertaining tale because the human brain has evolved around the sharing of stories. For the ancient Hawaiians, stories were essential to their way of life. History, genealogy, and social values were all passed down through strong oral tradition.CommentsEthan RomeExecutive Director, Health Care for America NowAs Republicans come to terms with the futility of their incessant efforts to repeal, defund, undermine and otherwise trash Obamacare, they\u0027re turning to a new last-ditch strategy: make it harder for people who desperately need health care to get it under the new law.Comments (59)Mark ShriverSenior Vice President for Strategic Initiatives, Save the ChildrenFrom Hurricanes Sandy and Isaac, to Sandy Hook, to the Oklahoma tornadoes, the last 12 months have featured natural disasters and high-profile school tragedies. Unfortunately, it\u0027s clearer than ever that children in the United States are still not getting all the protections they deserve.CommentsBarbara Hannah GruffermanAuthor, \"The Best of Everything After 50,\" Host, AARP YouTube Channel; Positive Living ExpertIf you\u0027re going on a first date -- especially one where kind friends made the introduction, or, thanks to the Internet, you\u0027ve met only virtually -- you will no doubt want to put your absolute prettiest foot forward and plan a fun and flirty outfit that makes you look and feel fabulous. But, doesn\u0027t your long-term love deserve just as much effort from you?CommentsJon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranMissile strikes, as limited and justified as they may be, are an act of war against the Assad regime. Yet, I get no sense that the United States has any clear idea of our strategic or operational end state.Comments (74)Nina MunkAuthor, The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End PovertyDertu\u0027s aging borehole had broken down, and not for the first time. In this instance, however, the situation was especially dire: it was the dry season, and both generator-driven pumps had given out at once.CommentsDan GlickmanVice President of the Aspen Institute and Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterI applaud Obama for sending a resolution to Congress that would, if passed, legitimize any military action the United States would take against the Assad government. Establishing legitimacy and a robust public debate over proposed military action are signs of a healthy democracy.Comments (23)Jeffrey HadzinskyComedy writerMy mother is a funeral director so I\u0027ve witnessed people dealing with loss my entire life. This did not prepare me at all for what I was about to and am still dealing with to this day.Comments (107)Napoleon PerdisMakeup artistAs a makeup artist, I\u0027ve always been fascinated by how makeup, hair and fashion choices can completely change a woman\u0027s look, her outlook, and the way she\u0027s perceived. Watching celebrities change like chameleons has practically become a national pastime in the age of Instagram.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgPoliticians and the media were all too willing to repeat what CEOs of big for-profit insurance corporations were saying without analyzing their motives or taking into account the fact that the marketplaces will force real competition in the health insurance world.Comments (182)Jeffrey Walker and Ray ChambersFor millions of parents and children in the developing world, the glimpse of a backpack on a health worker is a sign of security, of hope, and the promise of a healthier child.CommentsAdam Grant, 2013. 4.09Kimberly Dark, 2013. 4.09Mark Adnum, 2013. 4.09William Bradley, 2013. 4.09András Simonyi, 2013. 4.09Dr. Gail Gross, 2013. 4.09Georges Ugeux, 2013. 4.09Bernadette Noll, 2013. 4.09Dr. Lisa Fitzpatrick, 2013. 4.09Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, 2013. 4.09Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"ONE STEP CLOSER TO WAR",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
