{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureA simple truth: You can\u0027t get the right answer if you ask the wrong question. The furious debate over how best to cut the deficit illustrates the point. It\u0027s all about how best to enforce austerity. How do we bring the federal budget into \"primary balance\" by 2015? Pencils sharpen; green eye shades are donned. So, rather than discussing how we can actually restructure the American economy for long-term growth and sustainability, this is a debate about who takes the hit. There are progressive answers and regressive ones; some that make more sense, and some that make less -- but neither of which will help the middle class.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 11.24.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowI don\u0027t believe we fully grasp the likelihood of Palin actually winning the presidency. Despite the giddy snickering at the notion, she could seriously do it. It\u0027s happened before, and we underestimate the frivolity of the American voter at our own risk.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 11.23.2010One scoop that Wikileaks didn\u0027t manage to land was this: Afghan President Hamid Karzai has been having high-level negotiations for months with some dude who\u0027s been pretending to be a major player in the Taliban.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 11.24.2010Author, The Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to BeProgressives need to spend less time commiserating over all the good things that Congress should do but won\u0027t, and more time thinking about the things Obama could do if he aggressively seized the reins of government.Read Post | CommentsRev. James Martin, S.J., 11.23.2010Catholic priest and author, The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) EverythingWhile it doesn\u0027t mean at all that the pope has approved condoms for use in terms of birth control, the Vatican\u0027s latest pronouncement is the first time that a pope has given voice to what many moral theologians have been saying for years.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 11.24.2010Former Secretary of Labor; Professor at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock: The Next Economy and America\u0027s Future\u0027The Palin Strategy is to circumvent the Republican establishment. That\u0027s why her path to the Republican nomination isn\u0027t the usual insider game. It\u0027s a celebrity game -- a snark-fest with the nation\u0027s entire white working class.Read Post | CommentsMichael Winship, 11.24.2010Senior writer at Public Affairs TelevisionTo many hard line Republicans, like the cranky travelers who balk and rage at scans and searches, security may no longer be the priority it once was. Not when there\u0027s a presidency to destroy.Read Post | CommentsRaymond J.

In the last weeks a number of major events have taken place that are beginning to shift the balance of energy in significant ways.Read Post | CommentsChris Kelly, 11.24.2010Writer, Real Time with Bill MaherSarah Palin is clearly a student of film history. So when she says Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is one of her \"favorite movies,\" she must know it was written by a communist, right?Read Post | CommentsCaroline Shin, 11.24.2010Multimedia journalistMaking a \"perfectly juicy, perfectly tasty\" turkey requires some unusual steps, according to Dave Arnold, director of the French Culinary Institute.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 11.24.2010Rabbi and writerIt takes one heck of a lot of chutzpa to tell gay men or women not to adopt when we refuse to do so ourselves. Surely leaving kids to drown without love is deeply immoral. But to stop others from rescuing them is an abomination.Read Post | CommentsMichael B. Keegan, 11.24.2010President, People For the American WayFischer\u0027s extreme view on gay people is disturbing, but it\u0027s not unique: The Family Research Council\u0027s Tony Perkins has repeatedly insulted servicemembers in his quest to keep gays and lesbians from serving in the military.Read Post | CommentsChristine Pelosi, 11.24.2010Campaign Boot Camp author; California DNC MemberWhat lies ahead in California is a costly, multimillion dollar ballot fight designed by anti-immigrant groups to divide families, communities, and coalitions.Read Post | CommentsOne For The Table, 11.24.2010oneforthetable.comIt started simply enough: my better half felt the need to bake. I\u0027ll bake, begrudgingly. But I\u0027m always prepared to participate in the end result, which in this case was a pecan pie of monstrous proportions.Read Post | CommentsGeoffrey R. Stone, 11.24.2010Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of ChicagoAs much as we need courts to protect us against the \"tyranny of the majority,\" it is even more essential -- especially in the case of \u0027don\u0027t ask, don\u0027t tell\u0027 -- for them to protect us against the tyranny of the minority.Read Post | CommentsHarry Shearer, 11.23.2010Just a guyIt\u0027s almost as if President Bush\u0027s account of Hurricane Katrina was sealed in amber in early September 2005, and he\u0027s done no reading about it in preparation for his encounter with History. But that couldn\u0027t be true, could it?Read Post | CommentsRobert Stavins and Richard Schmalensee, 11.24.2010Those who believe that renewable electricity standards would create a huge number of green jobs have forgotten the lesson of Detroit: a large domestic market does not guarantee a healthy domestic industry.Read Post | CommentsMichael Laiskonis, 11.24.2010People are curious, I guess, not just in what we chefs eat during our downtime, but also how we fit those meals into the odd, long hours we work. It\u0027s true: I cook at home nearly everyday.Read Post | CommentsEve Ensler, 11.23.2010Author of \u0027I Am An Emotional Creature\" and \"The Vagina Monologues,\" Founder of V-DayWhy are we still arguing over the definition of genocide and femicide and spending fortunes counting the numbers of raped women rather than stopping the atrocities?Read Post | CommentsLincoln Mitchell, 11.24.2010Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityThe new airport security measures demonstrate a frightening willingness on the part of the government regulators to apply an authoritarian, and ultimately nonsensical, logic to a real, but controllable security problem.Read Post | CommentsAndrew Reinbach, 11.24.2010JournalistBasic real estate law could stop natural gas drilling in the Northeast. Legally, you can stop your neighbor from doing something if holding suit until you\u0027re actually harmed is ludicrous. In the case of \u0027fracking\u0027, it seems this applies.Read Post | CommentsJamie Schler, 11.24.2010Food blogger; Author, Life’s a FeastI do not celebrate Thanksgiving. It just doesn\u0027t seem natural or right anymore to prepare a feast in the name of something that our new friends and loved ones here in France know nothing about, feel absolutely no connection to.Read Post | CommentsLee Camp, 11.24.2010Comedian commentator featured on ABC, PBS, Comedy Central, Al Jazeera \u0026 Showtime; www.LeeCamp.netLast week not a single Senate Republican voted for a bill ensuring equal pay for women.
