{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonAhn-nyong-ha-seh-yo from Seoul. I\u0027m here for the launch of HuffPost Korea, which marks the 11th country where The Huffington Post\u0027s hybrid approach to journalism -- as a hub for original reporting and a blogging platform for a range of voices, both new and established -- is expanding the worldwide conversation. And we\u0027re very excited to be partnering with a great media company, the Hankyoreh Media Group. At the very moment that Korea is facing slowed-down economic growth and the unintended consequences of the rapid growth of the past, there is a growing recognition that there has to be a new path forward that will allow Koreans to tap into their creativity and ability to innovate while reducing the cost of stress on their workforce. HuffPost Korea will be using all the tools at our disposal to tell these stories -- and just as important, to help Koreans tell their stories themselves.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"In this incredibly moving talk, waitress-turned-equal-rights-advocate Ash Beckham shares a story about how a little girl\u0027s innocence stopped her in her tracks. See what this profound encounter reveals about finding the courage to be yourself and to say the things you never thought you could say.Comments (30)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027House Speaker John Boehner says raising the minimum wage is \"bad policy\" because it will cause job losses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says a minimum wage increase would be a job killer. This is all bunk.Comments (72)Victor StengerPhysicist, PhD, bestselling authorReligious debaters are usually very smooth and well prepared. The reason is not that their arguments are so persuasive but that they generally have spent years polishing the same old arguments.CommentsMark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostWhen you read that story recently about the Burger King customers who were insulted on their order receipt, you may have felt shock, outrage and sympathy for the customers. I felt a little of that, but something else, too: I felt empathy for the employee who typed up the receipt and then got fired over it.Comments (200)Beth LeybaCommunity activist, writer, student, momI am somebody. I have value. I am working, even if it\u0027s barely enough to get by. I will simply keep doing the best I can for my children, and I will continue feeding homeless youth even as I struggle to put food on my own table.Comments (92)Kia MakarechiSenior Editor for Mobile and Innovations, The Huffington PostThe debate over gentrification is in full-swing again after Spike Lee weighed in. His critics are calling him racist for ripping \u0027hipsters.\" They\u0027re wrong.CommentsMina SohnEditor-at-large, HuffPost KoreaHuffPost Korea will, above all, change the tone of existing news and suggest measures to recognize problems and improve them cheerfully and intelligently. Breaking social prejudice and dissolving journalistic hierarchies, it intends to convey the reader the \"real\" news of life in which all of us are the hosts and main characters.CommentsMartha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIf you look only at the categories for acting, women come in for an equal share of the Oscars, and are often held in higher esteem than the men. But peeking behind the velvet curtains, the scene shifts.CommentsWilliam DameronWriter and Blogger, \u0027The Authentic Life\u0027Eventually I worked up enough courage to come out to my older brother Chuck, who lived seven hundred miles away. I sat on the floor of my basement apartment bedroom and dialed his number, each time hanging up before the first ring. On the fourth try I let the call complete.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThroughout much of her long life Mrs. Clark was often at odds with South Carolina leaders and made other enemies as she traveled throughout the Deep South pioneering literacy and citizenship education for black Americans.CommentsKuoth WielSouth Sudanese model and actorWomen make up over 60 percent of South Sudan\u0027s population and they make up the majority of those suffering. Despite the fact that the conflict is the result of political divisions within the South Sudan government, these women and all those who are suffering, displaced and hungry do not care about politics.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorShort of a mass popular resurgence, how can we break free of this destructive cycle of same-old bought and sold elections and tired rhetoric that ultimately leads to gridlock government?Comments (12)Philip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America\u0027America now ranks 20th in the world in ease of starting a business, and probably close to last in ease of rebuilding infrastructure. But this is because of the massive accretion of obsolete laws and regulations, not the new ones.CommentsChristopher Rosen and Mike Hogan12 Years a Slave, Gravity and American Hustle are vying for this year\u0027s Best Picture honors. Let\u0027s figure out which one wins.CommentsJack MirkinsonSenior Media Editor, The Huffington PostThis is a film in which the true hero of the AIDS movement is a straight bigot who helps educate all of the queer people he once despised about how to treat themselves and fight the system. In its haste to canonize Ron Woodroof, McConaughey\u0027s character, it almost entirely erases the real saints of the AIDS movement: the men and women of the LGBT community who saved their own lives.Comments (27)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersDiffering theological views on important issues of sexuality will need time, patience, deep biblical reflection, respectful discourse, and religious liberty to be worked out in the churches. But the perception of Christian faith is in grave danger when Christians try to use the law to publicly discriminate against those who don\u0027t adhere to their point of view.Comments (11)Em \u0026 LoThe Emily Posts of the modern bedroomThis year\u0027s crop of best acting nominees in the lead and supporting roles somehow manage to represent the archetypes of every person you\u0027ve ever dated. To wit...CommentsRay HalbritterOneida Indian Nation Representative; CEO, Oneida Nation EnterprisesSometimes you have to listen for the silences to understand what is actually being said. The NFL is considering penalties against players if they utter one of the most despicable racial slurs against African Americans.CommentsValerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWith her slight build, distinctly precise diction, and relentless energy, Representative Shirley Chisholm of New York will be forever remembered for the ground she broke in Congress, and the ground she laid for millions of women, girls, and African Americans in this country.CommentsCecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesIt\u0027s clear that this bill isn\u0027t about religious liberties. It\u0027s about corporations who want a license to discriminate against people by denying services, taking away birth control coverage, and blocking access to health care. If Governor Jan Brewer can see that this is way too extreme, surely the U.S. Supreme Court can, too.Comments (37)Lauren LubinExecutive producer, \u0027We Exist\u0027\"Gender binary\" describes our current belief system that gender exists as only male or female. There are, in fact, many more genders, and this post highlights the five areas that are most challenging to those who identify outside of the gender binary.CommentsDr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistBad dreams and nightmares are among the most startling and emotionally potent of remembered dreams. Even a partially remembered disturbing dream can linger in our waking minds. But what do we know about this phenomenon of disturbed dreaming? And what\u0027s the difference between a bad dream and a nightmare?CommentsTim SackettHR and recruiting proHello. My name is Tim Sackett, and I\u0027m a hugger. Being a hugger can make for some awkward moments -- what if the other person isn\u0027t expecting a hug, or doesn\u0027t want one, and you\u0027re coming in arms-wide-open!?CommentsMona ShattellRegistered Nurse; Associate Dean for Research at the College of Science and Health, and Associate Professor of Nursing, DePaul UniversityI agree that as a therapist, there are good reasons for some separation. But do we need to take it as far as we have, and continue to? Can we be more authentic, as Ash Beckham encourages us to be? Can\u0027t health care providers and therapists be more themselves?CommentsHonor SachsAssistant Professor of History, Western Carolina UniversityThe monument to Denmark Vesey resonates with particularly profound meaning today. It is not a stretch to see how this perspective on Vesey\u0027s memory speaks as much to our modern struggles with race and violence as it does to our understanding of the past.CommentsRep. Earl BlumenauerU.S. Representative from OregonAs costs for our nation grow, there are areas where we can cut spending. The first place we should start is with our unnecessary and expensive spending on nuclear weapons that are more suited for the Cold War than the strategic challenges we face today.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesLet\u0027s not forget that in Arizona, it\u0027s still legal to refuse to serve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in your bakery or your photo studio for religious or any other reasons, due in no small part to Jan Brewer\u0027s hostility to LGBT rights throughout her tenure.Comments (71)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe media have adopted a new and dangerous convention. People who are radical in their goals and methods are routinely mislabeled \u0027conservative.\u0027 Edmund Burke, the patron saint of real conservatism, must be spinning in his grave when Sarah Palin is called \u0027conservative.\u0027Comments (42)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsFukushima is far more than a disaster diary. It also provides a clear-eyed look at the Japanese regulatory regime that helped make the disaster all but inevitable, and makes a strong case that U.S. oversight is plagued by the same complacent attitude and undue industry influence.CommentsEight by EightThe magazine the beautiful game deservesWhen I first started going to matches, it was very rare to know anything about the owners or chairmen of football clubs, the majority being long-serving aldermen, trusted accountants, and justices of the peace -- pillars of the local community with lots of professional initials after their names.CommentsRay Halbritter, 2014.28.02Robert Espinoza, 2014.28.02Hipmunk, 2014.28.02Dr. Reese Halter, 2014.28.02Charlotte Robinson, 2014.28.02Keith Wade, 2014.28.02Julie Cole, 2014.28.02Rob Brooks, 2014.28.02Ivan Katz, 2014.28.02Alyson Renaldo, 2014.28.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"OBAMA WARNS RUSSIA: BACK OFF",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
