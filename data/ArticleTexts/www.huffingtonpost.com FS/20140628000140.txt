{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoCritics of the decision regard this approach as fundamentally naïve and unrealistic about what actually happens when anti-abortion protesters gather near the entrances to these facilities. These critics maintain that the image of the grandmotherly woman calmly approaching a young woman heading into the clinic in order to have an abortion and asking her if they might chat a bit about whether this is really a good idea is wholly fanciful and blinks the reality of what actually happens at these moments. In their view, a clean, simple rule, like the one enacted by Massachusetts, is a perfectly reasonable way to deal with the world as it is, rather than the world as Chief Justice Roberts imagines it to be. In the view of the critics, the more \"narrowly-tailored\" restrictions that Roberts would approve are not really responsive to the complex, highly-emotional, and often intimidating and even dangerous situations that actually arise in these settings.Whether finding new ways to open unserved markets or putting people to work modernizing our nation\u0027s infrastructure, there are many ways to create good jobs by solving some of the biggest problems facing our communities.

But Charles and David Koch are in a class by themselves.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027There are plenty of legitimate questions on which to press Ms. Barra; I have asked my fair share of them and will continue to. What Mr. Lauer asked had no place in modern discourse. It disrespects parents and professionals alike.Chief Deputy WhipOur war in Iraq was fundamentally a war of choice, and it was the wrong choice -- a war fought on false pretenses and for false purposes. But this \"cake-walk\" became an occupation, with years of vicious and deadly street warfare, sectarian violence, constant terrorist bombings, and finally no real political solutions to unite the country.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe IRS simply does not have the budget to do its lawful job effectively, which is to collect revenue for the U.S. government.

Dodge FoundationI want to watch a show that criticizes our reliance on incarceration, not one that depicts a jumpsuit as an item every woman needs in her closet.

The areas for judgement, from space between thighs to brow ridge prominence, are so numerous that it feels safer to just settle on one and own it.News Editor, HuffPost WomenOn any given evening, over 610,000 Americans are without shelter.
