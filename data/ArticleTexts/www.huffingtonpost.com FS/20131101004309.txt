{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranHow is this even a debate? How is it that men and women who served in uniform get smeared as lazy and unmotivated to work, as soon as they need help feeding their families by using food stamps? How is it that they get targeted, when we clearly have the money to give them the aid they\u0027ve earned, and desperately need? It\u0027s way past time to say \"enough\" to these proposals being floated falsely under the flag of \"fiscal responsibility.\" Real fiscal responsibility goes after those who least need help first -- not those who need help the most. This is about priorities, and unfortunately, as a nation, we aren\u0027t really showing any. That has to change.Comments (586)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeIf we strive to understand the challenges that teachers face and empower them to improve flawed policy, we will get so much more from our investment in their salaries. Forcing teachers to compete against one another for better scores on a standardized test is not the way to improve education.CommentsMichael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Just how rapid is the current rate of warming of the ocean? There is an interesting new article by Rosenthal and collaborators in the latest issue of the journal Science entitled \"Pacific Ocean Heat Content During the Past 10,000 Years\" that attempts to address this question.CommentsClaire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostIn this child-protective age of trick-or-treating being limited to daylight hours, we need scary kids books more than ever. And with Halloween around the corner, what better time is there to embrace the creepy side of kiddie lit?Comments (42)Jon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comOver the course of 5 hours between October 24 and 25, I wrote down every commercial that aired on FOX News during shows hosted by Brett Baier, Gretchen Carlson, Shep Smith Bill Hemmer and Greta Van Susteren because I wanted to know what was being advertised. Here\u0027s what I found.Comments (267)Megan CarpentierWriter, editor and digital media strategist.No matter where you go on the Web -- be it Google, Bing or Yahoo to search; Twitter or Facebook to social network; or your email provider or favorite shopping sites -- you\u0027re giving up a little piece of yourself, and sometimes enough to cobble together your identity.CommentsTerry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenA feminist budget would recognize the need for change. It would be designed to reduce income and wealth inequality, which disproportionately affects all women but particularly women in communities of color.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOBy maintaining an unchanged policy stance, the Federal Reserve delivered on consensus market expectations. The question now is: How long will this sustain the mix of financial conditions that the Fed and investors desire, and is needed to improve job prospects given the extent of Congressional dysfunction?Comments (34)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (16)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Sure, it pales in comparison to coveting thy neighbor, but the Bible does warn us that we should \"not go about spreading slander.\" And if your mother is like mine, she probably told you that if you don\u0027t have anything nice to say, you shouldn\u0027t say it at all. But what if our moms were wrong?Comments (28)Beth WoolseyWriter, humorist at the Five Kids Is A Lot of Kids blogIt\u0027s time to come clean, parents. All the way out of the candy-stealing closet. It\u0027s time to stand up for ourselves and demand our rights, because you know what? Kids can\u0027t do this trick-or-treat thing without us.CommentsMichael ZackaPresident and CEO of Tetra Pak, United States and CanadaWhat\u0027s draining U.S. energy resources faster than any other product or technology? Cars? Lighting? HVAC? Refrigeration? None of the above.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgIf you think that lack of access to dental care is just a problem for the poor in this country, think again. More and more middle-income Americans, even those with dental insurance, are finding that going to the dentist for even routine care is not a possibility because of the cost.Comments (129)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolThroughout the push for national insurance reform, the president and his Democratic allies in Congress repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered. The Republicans didn\u0027t help the situation, opposing Obamacare long after the U.S. Supreme Court declared it the law of the land.Comments (532)Keith ThomsonWriterProject Rahab uses SIGINT -- intelligence based on interception of signals, conversations and electronic communications -- to gather information on foreign business competition that can benefit German companies.CommentsGreg SavageLeader of the global recruitment industryWhy do people, invited for a dinner party at 7:30, think it\u0027s cool to arrive at 8:30? It\u0027s rude. It\u0027s inconsiderate. And it\u0027s selfish.Comments (1,943)Brian CladoosbyPresident, National Congress of American Indians; Chairman, Swinomish Indian Tribal CommunityNo racial group would stand for a team name that denigrated their cultural identity, but Native Americans are expected to stand by and accept this treatment just because some don\u0027t see the word as offensive.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile women started to change the workplace in the \u002770s, it\u0027s only been since the \u002790s that their presence has gained real mass. As their numbers grow, assumptions about what they want and even who they are start to look as relevant as carbon paper.Comments (21)Zeeshan AleemAssociate Editor, The Huffington PostWhether it\u0027s running a faster mile or being able to afford an apartment big enough to have all your friends over, we have a way of deluding ourselves into thinking the ultimate vista lies just around the next bend, if one toils for long enough.Comments (19)Nan AronPresident, Alliance for JusticeWe believe no court, and certainly not the crucial D.C. Circuit, should be forced to do its job with 27 percent of its seats empty. Nominating qualified men and women for vacant judgeships isn\u0027t some kind of illegitimate act, or underhanded power grab.CommentsMadeleine FryFreelance journalist, specialising in an eclectic mix of music, religion and African politics.I should probably point out that I\u0027m not against the original meaning: remembering how Britain twice sent a whole generation of its young men off to be slaughtered, and that future generations should be able to live without the fear of enduring such violence. Yet that meaning often seems to get forgotten as Remembrance Sunday becomes a celebration of jingoism and militarism.Comments (785)Barbara LeePresident, Barbara Lee Political Office and Barbara Lee Family FoundationMost adults may not dress up in costume for Halloween. Yet that hasn\u0027t stopped some political candidates from masquerading as something they\u0027re not in order to woo women voters. Here\u0027s a look at a few of these tricks -- and their more forthright alternatives.CommentsAndy OstroyPolitical and Pop Culture AnalystTalk to a passionate Democrat and they\u0027ll more than likely offer you this lofty opinion of themselves: \"We\u0027re the smart ones. The rational and logical ones. The ones who care about others. We\u0027re better than they are.\" But are they?Comments (84)Prerna LalFounder, DreamActivist.orgOne of the greatest victories of right-wing extremists has been to push immigration reform advocates to adopt right-wing talking points. As such the entire immigration reform debate is framed along the binary of good immigrant and bad immigrants.CommentsBarbara BrunoNFL Analyst and Commentator, Independent Film Producer, Non-Profit Grant WriterThe Dolphins\u0027 D may be showing some grit, but sophomore QB Ryan Tannehill has had some rough sledding recently with 10 turnovers in his team\u0027s four-game losing streak.CommentsDanielle CadetEditor, Black VoicesOne really important thing black people don\u0027t do that a lot of white people seem to think is necessary: we don\u0027t paint our faces white when we dress up as a white person for Halloween.Comments (1,285)Nancy Berk, Ph.D.Clinical psychologist, comic and authorElvira, Mistress of the Dark, has been rocking Halloween 365 days a year for more than three decades. And it seems that the woman behind the campy vampirish persona may have some family roots to thank for that plunge into a costumed life (and plunging neckline) that has made her a lasting international success.CommentsDr. Marcia HootmanAuthor and fitness expertBy the end of the third week, it was as if any dreariness of my life started to clear and the sun popped out. Then I realized the miracle. Nothing outside of me changed -- it was all an inside job.CommentsBasicNeedsMental health is still seriously considered taboo in Lao PDR and is thought to be caused by the possession of evil spirits.CommentsStephen BellBlogger, avid runnerI live with a lung disease. A disease that is supposed to diminish my lungs over time. I\u0027m aware of all of that. And that\u0027s exactly why I run; to celebrate, and there is no better way to celebrate life than going out there and running the New York City marathon.CommentsWilliam O. BeemanProfessor and Chair of the Department of Anthropology, University of MinnesotaIf the United States is viewing uranium enrichment on a case by case basis, then Iran is the only nation that is being treated in this manner.Comments (96)Jeffrey Rubin, 2013.31.10Gregoris Kalai, 2013.31.10Kristen Noel, 2013.31.10Hipmunk, 2013.31.10Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013.31.10Debbie Martinez, 2013.31.10John T.
