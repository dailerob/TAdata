{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The Fed is famous for raising rates prematurely, seeing ghosts of inflation. But there is no inflation on the horizon -- the bigger worry is deflation. In fact, the inflation rate is well below the Fed\u0027s own target of two percent. And the Fed is the only game in town. On balance, I think the opponents of a rate hike have the better argument. But consider for a moment that last assumption -- that the Fed is the only game in town. The larger issue, which is getting submerged in the great debate about raising rates, is that the Fed should not be the only game in town. With fiscal stimulus ruled out politically, pressure is on the Fed to be the sole engine of growth. Yet the central bank can only do so much.We need to make sure those who do the people\u0027s work in Washington are actually doing it -- not worrying about former or future bosses at the public\u0027s expense.Democratic candidate for President; Former Secretary of State, U. S. Senator and First LadyUnited States Senator for WisconsinAmericans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. People should not have to go without the medication they need just because their elected officials aren\u0027t willing to challenge the drug lobby. The public is fed up, and they have a right to be fed up.Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontWe are wrapping up a long, cruel summer of senseless, preventable gun violence. Americans are being gunned down in our churches, schools, movie theaters, military recruitment centers, workplaces, and homes. Which is why we\u0027re turning September 10 into a national day of action to make good on our pledge to do \"whatever it takes.\"Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaTrump is often called \"crazy,\" but there is method to his madness, and that method is matched and displayed by the speaking style he employs on the stump. Even his detractors see that a large part of his appeal is that he comes across as unscripted.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolFor years, women of color and low-income women have heard this patriarchal message from various messengers implying that we are naive, misguided, and lack the intellectual capacity to make personal, critical, often difficult, informed decisions about our lives in general and our bodies more specifically.Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationThe collapse of the American trainee force in Syria should not come as a surprise to anyone who watched a few hundred ISIS fighters rout 30,000 Iraqi troops, who dropped their weapons and ran, abandoning the city of Mosul. This is after the Iraqi army was trained by the U.S. for 12 years.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThis is the first generation of American children expected to live shorter lives than their parents. If that\u0027s not a call to action, I don\u0027t know what is.Author, Producer, AdvocateOn the surface, it looks like any other children\u0027s summer camp -- kids are running around doing sports, swimming, and lots of other fun activities. However, it\u0027s a retreat entirely for transgender children, teens, and their families.Public speaker, activist, OlympianThis month, President Obama must decide whether the Trading With the Enemy Act still authorizes sanctions against Cuba. The act requires an annual determination by the president that a national emergency exists with respect to Cuba, one that justifies sanctions.Financial Commentator, Professor of Law, Florida International UniversityAre my examples of this style diverse? Fashion and beauty media, this one is for you. Cornrows, box braids, bantu knots, saris, dashikis and everything else that is outside of white American culture aren\u0027t new or fresh simply because you finally recognized its existence.Cultural writer based in NYC.I need to highlight the issue that underlies this debate, and has fueled the decades of hostility towards trans women of all ages -- misogyny.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandBRUSSELS -- While the world is focused on ISIS, the reality is that Assad\u0027s barrel bombs are the leading killer of Syrian civilians. Even the mere threat of a no-fly zone could be enough to move the Syrian crisis towards a political solution. A no-fly zone would also suffocate a central ISIS recruitment narrative by demonstrating that the West is interested in protecting Syrians.Syrian National Coalition’s Representative to the Benelux and European UnionBob Takes on Gun-Worshiping Facebook Troll; Alex Jones Reacts to Virginia By Attacking Hillary Clinton; Chez Has Had Enough of Everything; The Second Amendment is the NRA\u0027s Skeleton Key; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027We cannot make this mistake again. We cannot let this election ignore the elephant in the room again. The system is rigged. And no matter how inspiring or angry or stubborn or passionate the next president is, if he or she doesn\u0027t make fixing democracy the first priority, then as Obama told us, \"nothing else is going to change.\"Law professor, activist, possible candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentGiven the fragile state of abortion rights today, and the determination of those who would undo them further, Pollitt\u0027s book offers an important rallying cry. Her analysis is not perfect, but on the whole, her argument is persuasive -- and necessary.Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawBeyond the constitutional infringements, there are other significant consequences of \"submit now-and-sue later,\" including the unavoidable loss of law enforcement legitimacy, and the cost of settlements brought by victims, a price ultimately paid by taxpayers.Attorney, former member of the New York State Assembly (1990-2000), founding partner of consulting firm the MirRam Group.\"Hey!\" my husband yelled, iPhone poised to take one last photo. They turned around, and my daughter had what I call the smile of fear. In the photo, you can see she is looking off camera -- at me. My husband snapped the picture, she turned back around and was gone.JournalistIt will be interesting to watch pro-gun zealots spin the news about how guns protect us from crime when gun sales continue to soar but so does violent crime.Mike the Gun GuyFor my contemporaries, let\u0027s remember to be more introspective, less harsh on ourselves with our follies and less aggrandizing with our accomplishments. Listen, do not compare, connect and remember -- we have a purpose.Publicist and lobbyist; President and CEO, Pae \u0027?ina Communications; Partner, The Island AgencyHis name was Bill Stewart, a courageous ABC newsman. According to published reports and to interviews conducted with journalists who covered the story, Stewart was executed by Nicaragua\u0027s National Guard during the Civil War of 1979. As a CBS News correspondent myself covering that war, I was in Nicaragua the day Stewart was killedPlaywright and former Emmy Award-winning television news journalistAs a natural optimist, I like to think that we\u0027re making headway on the poverty issue, but that does not mean we can pat ourselves on the back and unfurl the banner proclaiming \"mission accomplished.\" In fact, I would argue that any progress thus far represents the proverbial low-hanging fruit and that further advances will require even deeper commitment and more creative thinking.President, Communities In Schools, Inc.ATI is butchering that time-honored relationship. It has demanded tax abatements and special electrical rates and forced excessive overtime on weary workers. Its disdain for civic engagement is most clearly demonstrated by its decision to unlawfully lock its 2,200 skilled union workers out of their jobs on Aug. 15, despite the steelworkers\u0027 willingness to continue working.International President, United SteelworkersYou know when Trump talks about not having time for being PC and for wanting to \"make America great again\"? He means for white America. And the silent majority he refers to? And people being \"afraid\" to say things? White people. Afraid to say racist things out loud.Former teacher at Julia de Burgos Elementary School; now union activist in Philadelphia, PAIt is tragically ironic that President Obama is allowing Shell to move forward with oil drilling when the Arctic is already being impacted by climate change.President \u0026 CEO, Defenders of WildlifeWhether a woman participates in tech as an engineer, a developer, a marketer, or in some other capacity, there is room enough for all of us. It is a difficult industry that is rapidly changing, and we have no business making things even more difficult on each other.Founder/CEO, APPCityLife Inc. \u0026 Cofounder, Hautepreneurs and HauteHopesWe have to come to terms with the dismaying truth that public opinion, in individuals and in aggregate, is only exceptionally the outcome of an informed and thoughtful process of deliberation.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghTrump\u0027s slogan of \"Make America Great Again\" is really a cover for \"Make America White Again.\" Hate and prejudice is built on ignorance and fear and no one has helped create that more than the media and Donald Trump.Rick Najera is a national speaker, award-winning screenwriter, director, comedian and author of the critically acclaimed book \"Almost White: Forced Confessions of a Latino in Hollywood.\"Twelve years ago, we stood in front of our favorite people and promised to love one another. We said in sickness and in health. We said in good times and bad. But we were children then. Babies, it seems.WriterOne of the most famous gags in the strip came every fall, when mean little Lucy would tee up a football and beg poor old Charlie Brown to kick it. Lucy pulls the ball away from Charlie Brown, and he lands flat on his back... again. It always happens like that. So let\u0027s look at the lessons here, and why a Biden campaign would be a big mistake.Communications consultantWhen dining out, people who eat special diets are the butt of seemingly every joke at the table. \"How do you know if someone\u0027s a vegan?
