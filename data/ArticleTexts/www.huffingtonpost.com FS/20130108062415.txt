{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Greetings from Las Vegas, where I\u0027ve landed in the midst of a perfect storm for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The main elements of this perfect storm are disruptive technology, our dysfunctional health care system, and the growing desire people have to take control of their own health and well-being. And it\u0027s powered by our growing awareness of the destructive power and tremendous cost of stress in our lives. That\u0027s why HuffPost is rolling out GPS for the Soul, a new app that\u0027s part of our comprehensive lifestyle coverage around the theme \"Less Stress, More Living.\" And it\u0027s why this year\u0027s CES has the potential to be one of the most transformative ever. There\u0027s a significant change in attitude about what role technology can, and should, be playing in our lives -- from the growing prevalence of mindfulness practices in the workplace to the robust market of wearable devices providing biofeedback. Here\u0027s hoping the perfect storm on display this week in Las Vegas leads to sunnier days everywhere.Read Post | CommentsBill Moyers and Michael Winship, 01/07/13Every American packing heat is a frightening vision of our future. It doesn\u0027t have to be, if only we stop and think.Read Post | Comments (526)Jim Sleeper, 01/07/13Lecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityHere in today\u0027s casino-financed, un-unionized, gladatorially entertained America, a lot of the people who are arming themselves against irrational fears have let themselves become the meek servants of huge corporate bureaucracies that no one elected.Read Post | Comments (691)Aaron Belkin, 01/07/13Author, \u0027How We Won: Progressive Lessons from the Repeal of \"Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell\"\u0027It is too late for Hagel to undo the damage he caused to gay and lesbian people during his Senate career. But he now has an opportunity to make sure that the Pentagon keeps making progress on the route to full inclusion.Read Post | CommentsChristophe de Margerie, Felix Marquardt and Parag Khanna, 01/07/13The new actors of globalization aren\u0027t concepts or acronyms; they aren\u0027t even regions or countries. They are individual women and men, and it is time we became acquainted with them.Read Post | Comments (31)John Pavley, 01/07/13CTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerWhile it\u0027s great that we have modern medicine and pharmacology to alleviate the embarrassing problems of the natural aging process, I\u0027m really much too busy to \"grow old gracefully.\" I can\u0027t imagine retiring. That\u0027s where the apps come in.Read Post | Comments (30)Arianna Huffington, 01/07/13With President Obama\u0027s nomination of Hagel for Secretary of Defense, here is a post I wrote in August 2006 that reminds us why Hagel is such an inspired choice.Read Post | Comments (191)Oprah Winfrey, 01/05/13Chairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkNo matter what you\u0027re struggling through -- no matter the pain or anguish -- you can go inside behind your mind and observe it happening to you. Whatever it is, it isn\u0027t you. You are the observer.Read Post | Comments (96)Wadah Khanfar, 01/06/13Journalist; President, Sharq ForumThe United States, the western powers and some Arab states would push for a (moderate ) Syrian regime. That is to say, one that is far-removed from the Islamic movement, not hostile toward Israel and close to the West.Read Post | Comments (155)Allison Tate, 01/06/13Author, mother of fourI am always surprised by what strangers are willing to say, especially in front of my children.

He is a decorated war hero who earned two purple hearts for his heroism in Vietnam. He knows the sacrifices that we ask our brave service members to make because he has made them himself.Read Post | Comments (57)Robert Kuttner, 01/06/13Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027To the extent that the economy has remained stuck in first gear, it has everything to do with high unemployment and lagging wages, and just about nothing to do with the fiscal cliff or worries about the debt ratio 20 years down the road.Read Post | Comments (223)Bill McKibben, 01/07/13Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027It\u0027s not a fight, like education reform or abortion or gay marriage, between conflicting groups with conflicting opinions. We\u0027re talking about a fight between human beings and physics. And physics is entirely uninterested in human timetables.Read Post | Comments (248)Matt Stoller, 01/07/13Fellow, Roosevelt InstituteWhat seems to have happened is that American corporate executives are now more focused on financial engineering, which is essentially the extraction of capital from their enterprises and from the public, than they are at selling improved goods and services.Read Post | Comments (30)Kenna, 01/07/13Musician, activistRight now, more than anything, I could use some help reaching Bono -- figuratively and literally. I am a massive fan of his musical work, but his level of activism and effectiveness is what I aspire to achieve in my pursuit to raise awareness about the global clean water crisis.Read Post | CommentsmeQuilibrium, 01/07/13Personalized Stress ManagementWe are experiencing stress in epidemic proportions. In fact, stress is the new fat. Like obesity, it\u0027s hitting more and more people and at younger and younger ages. And like obesity it\u0027s insidious -- stress is so much a part of our lives that we don\u0027t notice it anymore.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 01/06/13Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Taming future deficits requires three steps having nothing to do with entitlements: Limiting the growth of overall healthcare costs, cutting our bloated military, and ending corporate welfare.Read Post | Comments (951)Michelangelo Signorile, 01/07/13Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesContrary to what many may believe -- and contrary to the Associated Press\u0027s banning of the word -- homophobia is alive and well, and we may be seeing it expressed more than before in the most \"pro-gay\" places.Read Post | Comments (348)Ralph Nader, 01/07/13Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorWhat is needed the most for the progressive movement is the establishment of congressional watchdog groups, each representing one of the 435 congressional districts in America.Read Post | Comments (38)Wendell Potter, 01/07/13Center for Public Integrity columnist, author, consultantFrom now on, health insurers will have to provide us with information in plain English, and in no more than four pages, about what their policies cover and how much we\u0027ll have to pay out of our own pockets when we get sick.Read Post | Comments (146)David Wild, 01/07/13TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027Tuesday night is our big Hollywood premiere for $ellebrity, an intriguing new feature documentary directed by Kevin Mazur about the price of fame today, and the way that the texture of celebrity has evolved -- or, it could be argued, de-evolved -- over time.Read Post | CommentsMichael Moore, 01/06/13Oscar and Emmy-winning directorBill, I see you\u0027re mad that back in 2007 former Sen. Chuck Hagel said that we were obviously \"fighting for oil\" in Iraq. You explain this was \"vulgar and disgusting\" and \"could be the straw that breaks the back of Hagel\u0027s chances\" to be Obama\u0027s next Defense Secretary.Read Post | Comments (821)Teresa Hsiao, 01/07/13Television writer, \u0027Family Guy\u0027It\u0027s the summer of 2006, and I\u0027ve already mapped out my post-college plan: spend two years at Lehman, start a company, become a billionaire, buy a house in the Hamptons, have an explosive divorce, die alone but surrounded by a mountain of gold bars.Read Post | CommentsLisa Belkin, 01/07/13Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostI have long been glad they \"dragged\" me to the ends of the earth, but it wasn\u0027t until the day in the Tetons that I fully understood what I was grateful for. Until then I\u0027d thought only of what the travel had given me as an individual -- the sense of comfort in new places, the knowledge that there was a great big world out there. My call to my father was the first time I appreciated what the trips had given us as a family.Read Post | Comments (11)Lev Raphael, 01/07/13Author, reviewer and bloggerWhenever Matthew protests he can\u0027t inherit money from his ex-fiancee\u0027s father because it would be \"wrong,\" you imagine Lady Mary braining him with a vase.Read Post | Comments (111)Rev.

Action, results, and lives saved are better. Passing the Gillibrand Gun Trafficking Prevention Act would make this country a better place to live in. It would make it a place where more people stay alive.Read Post | Comments (75)Steve Clemons, 01/06/13Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027The bottom line: Chuck Hagel kept the facility open and expanded it when he was restructuring and shifting priorities inside the USO to keep it alive. If Hagel had had a deep anti-Israel bias, others would have seen it and reported it.Read Post | Comments (25)Leo W. Gerard, 01/07/13International President, United SteelworkersAmericans believe their government should help when necessary. When the task is too big for a couple of Joes to achieve, Americans want their government to step up.
