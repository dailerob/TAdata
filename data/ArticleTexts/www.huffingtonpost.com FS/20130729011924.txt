{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week saw the resurfacing of an unfortunate episode that many had thought was over, or had at least conveniently forgotten about. I\u0027m talking, of course, about our still-sputtering economy. On Wednesday, President Obama gave what was billed as a major speech, in which he called on Congress to end the ongoing partisan gridlock and do something for the middle class, but offered few specifics on how to make this happen. In reality, the speech was mostly a pre-emptive strike in anticipation of upcoming budget and debt ceiling battles. But few in the country were paying attention, too caught up in the latest revelations in the summer\u0027s worst sequel (yes, worse than The Hangover Part III), Weinergate II: The Rise of Carlos Danger. The outpouring of ink and airtime provoked by some naked selfies and sleazy sexts proved once and for all that what America\u0027s job crisis really needs to move to the top of the agenda is a good sex scandal.Comments (88)Alec BaldwinActorAfter Michael Bloomberg, New York would benefit by electing an official who demonstrates some affinity for the needs of its middle-class citizens. But Anthony Weiner can\u0027t be that person.Comments (383)Marcia CrossAward-winning actressWhere I sit now is simply in awe, in awe of women \"leaning in\" and \"leaning out\" and the brilliance of their day-to-day achievements. Both journeys are all encompassing and require talent, endurance and devotion.Comments (75)Arianna HuffingtonHumans are built for communication, and anything that helps fill that insatiable need is going to take off. We\u0027re also built for narrative, and, even at 140 characters, Twitter can tap into that, too. Adam Bain, Twitter\u0027s president of global revenue, once said that \"Twitter is a series of \u0027now moments\u0027 across the world.\" But add up an accumulating series of now moments, and what you have is, well, history.Comments (19)Amber TamblynWriterTell Gynoticians like Rick Perry, Trent Franks, Pat McCrory and the Pat McCrorys of women like representative Jodie Laubenberg and Marsha Blackburn that enough is enough: We aren\u0027t just coming for their laws, we\u0027re coming for their JOBS.Comments (695)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistWe would have to park every single car in America for a full year to make up for the carbon pollution the tar sands pipeline would dump into our atmosphere. Everybody in favor, raise your hand.Comments (623)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Some say that we should wait again, wait longer to work on the immigration system, wait until later, do it slowly, over time, down the road, piece by piece. But the time has come to see the urgency of fixing this broken immigration system and begin to heal the nation.Comments (140)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWeiner and Abedin are perhaps the highest profile interfaith couple in America and the troubles in their relationship have the potential to be used as another case in point of those issuing dire warnings about interfaith marriages.Comments (365)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarShould there be more women in the senior ranks of organizations? Should men support that quest by fitting easily into -- and feeling respect in -- the role of caregiver? Should the numbers of opportunity reflect the gender makeup of the group. Yes.Comments (218)Jason WhitlockColumnist, FOXSports.comHere\u0027s what the race baiters on the right fail to comprehend: There\u0027s a clear-cut, easy-to-follow blueprint for avoiding the ravages of black-on-black violence and crime. America has yet to provide us a comparable blueprint for avoiding racial profiling.Comments (1,876)Keli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comIn this age of 24-7 paparazzi shots, most high profile new mothers hide out until they get their figures back into photo ready mode. But Middleton didn\u0027t do that, instead showing what a real mother\u0027s body looks like immediately after birth.Comments (306)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe gun lobby has been enriching gun manufacturers at the expense of our children\u0027s safety for far too long. For years the National Rifle Association has blocked the truth and actively fought against the passage and enforcement of gun safety laws.Comments (429)Jon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comThe one and only thing men fear during pregnancy is that during sex, they will poke the baby in the head with their penis. Amazing, right?Comments (608)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIn celebrating the one-year anniversary, the West would be well advised to also think in terms of foregone opportunities. And we should constantly remember the millions of unemployed, the alarmingly high joblessness among the young, the struggles that too many face in securing their families wellbeing, and the growing number of retirees that are legitimately worried about their pensions.Comments (107)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistGod, how we love the royals. Funny, because our country\u0027s whole existence is based on the desire to break away from the throne. Yet we\u0027re always looking for our own royalty. We like to talk about our dynasties (the Bushes) and our royal family of Camelot (the Kennedys). It\u0027s clear that, for all the revolutionary blood that was shed, we are in a perpetual state of Royal Envy.Comments (63)Michael F. JacobsonExecutive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestThe ingredient in question is carmine. It\u0027s a red dye extracted from the dried, pulverized bodies of the cochineal insect -- an unphotogenic arthropod native to Mexico and South America with a fondness for cactus. Dannon uses carmine in four flavors of Fruit on the Bottom yogurt.Comments (189)Shirin SadeghiIndependent TV \u0026 Radio Host, ex-BBC \u0026 Al JazeeraJust five months away from election day, and 49 days from the primaries, today it has been revealed that Anthony Weiner\u0027s wiener didn\u0027t resign when he did.Comments (159)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkTrayvon Martin went to store to buy Skittles and an iced tea. Trayvon Martin was shot dead by a civilian who had no authority to stop him. Trayvon Martin\u0027s killer wasn\u0027t arrested for weeks until after the horrible incident. Those are facts. And facts cannot be denied no matter how they may be twisted or spun.Comments (694)Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027President Obama and Press Secretary Carney are insensitive and wrong about the scandals. The scandals are not phony. They are real. If you want to talk phony, maybe these two gentlemen should check the mirror?Comments (515)Neil HarbissonArtistI don\u0027t feel that I\u0027m using technology, I don\u0027t feel that I\u0027m wearing technology, I feel that I am technology. I don\u0027t perceive my antenna as a device, I perceive it as a part of my body, I perceive it as an organ.Comments (109)Christopher Jorebon LoeakPresident of the Republic of the Marshall IslandsLying just six feet above the water some 2,000 miles south-west of Hawai\u0027i, there is no doubt that the Marshall Islands stands at the front line. But our story here is quickly becoming the story of people everywhere.Comments (26)Andrew DixonCertified personal trainerI take issue with transformations that are manipulated with Photoshop, professional lighting, postures to degrade or enhance their look, pro tans, sucking in or pushing out a belly, or flexing muscles. I decided to take my own transformation photos to see what was possible with a few tweaks.Comments (1,520)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostIf you think Anthony Weiner is a monster for degrading his marriage, maybe you should avoid doing the same in gigantic block letters on the front cover of your tabloid.Comments (332)Bill Moyers and Michael WinshipAnd you thought the government didn\u0027t have a jobs program. It does. The problem is that the pay and benefits are lousy, and in many cases the working conditions ain\u0027t so great either.Comments (449)Jill HerzigEditor in Chief, RedbookHow did we get to this ridiculous place, where losing the baby weight is a competitive sport followed by millions?Comments (66)Larry KingIconic television and radio interviewer, online at #LarryKingNow on @OraTVThe mission of the Larry King Cardiac Foundation is to save hearts. Flipboard is a powerful platform that makes it simple and fun for us to highlight visually-compelling articles on how to lead a heart healthy life.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorA little over two years ago, you made that statement while making a big splash by announcing that MLB was supporting Michelle Obama\u0027s Let\u0027s Move! fitness and nutrition campaign to attack childhood obesity. Since that time, you and the majority of MLB teams have become junk food pushers of the worst kind.CommentsRep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkNovember 30, 1950, was a living nightmare. In the battle of Kunu-ri, more than 5,000 American soldiers were killed, wounded or taken as prisoners of war. Ninety percent of my unit was killed. Little did I know, back then, that we were stopping communism.Comments (69)Jonathan RomainRabbi and writerIt is astonishing how many people do not know what their name means. It is not because they lack intelligence, but because English is a language with so many foreign roots that we have often lost touch with the origins of words. So whereas \u0027Myrtle\u0027 or \u0027Lilly\u0027 obviously refer to plants and flowers, many others are much less clear.Comments (159)Gov. Jack MarkellGovernor of DelawareOn July 17, I signed into law a bill enabling the formation of a new type of corporation that is hard wired to compete to be the best in America at being the best for America. These new Delaware public benefit corporations will harness the power of private enterprise to create public benefit.Comments (141)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersBanks are corporations, which are legal entities established under rules written by people. Their existence should advance America and Americans. Not the other way around. Many in Congress need to be reminded of that.Comments (120)Fathom, 2013.29.07Carrie Norton, 2013.28.07Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 2013.28.07Jeff Danziger, 2013.28.07Andy Plesser, 2013.28.07Subhankar Banerjee, 2013.28.07Mark Mondalek, 2013.28.07Rev.
