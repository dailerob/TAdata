{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"James MooreBest selling author, Director of Progress Texas PACWest, Texas might be the latest failure of our commitment to provide the resources to protect our communities and our environment but there is no shortage of similar examples. The BP well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, which continues to destroy sea life, was a product of lax enforcement, infrequent inspection caused by staffing shortages, and an intermingling of personnel between the regulated industry and the federal oversight agency. Generations from now the Gulf of Mexico will still be suffering and people may find it hard to understand what we allowed to happen in order to hold down our tax burden and to let industry create jobs and find energy without government meddling. How many times do we have to see these images and fail to connect cause and effect?Comments (212)Tony BennettRecording artistWhen it is harder to obtain a library card than it is to buy a gun in this country, something is terribly wrong. I mean, would you let your neighbor drive 100 miles an hour in their car through your children\u0027s school zone?CommentsSharon K. D’AgostinoVice President, Corporate Citizenship at Johnson \u0026 JohnsonThe Global Fund for Women has been a game-changer, a bridge builder and a force for constantly widening the circle of the movement for women\u0027s rights.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027When real or imagined grievances combine with rage, religious fundamentalism, political extremism, mental illness, or emotional instability, we lose the common good to dangerous violence, fear, and deep distrust in the social environment.CommentsKeith ThomsonWriterDuring his 1976 prosecution of Klansman Robert Chambliss in the Alabama church bombing case, the mail for (then) Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley included little in the way of praise. The norm was racist rants, personal insults and death threats, all of which I am now releasing here.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostTo each his own, but in my dieting and my life, I\u0027d rather rock than be in the rocking chair. I don\u0027t see myself as old, don\u0027t feel old, and don\u0027t want to be in the company of people who whine about getting old.Comments (57)Les LeopoldAuthor, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)Fear of debt is woven deeply into our culture. We associate debt with profligate spending, waste, gambling and overall sinfulness. As we learned during the housing bubble, it\u0027s easy to get in over our heads. So naturally we assume that the same must be true for our country -- government debt must be bad. But is it?Comments (12)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe same reasoning that leads Justice Scalia to conclude that the Framers\u0027 ignorance of cell phones and the Internet doesn\u0027t resolve questions about \"the freedom of speech\" should also lead him to the Framers\u0027 ignorance about the nature of sexual orientation. If one is going to be an \"originalist,\" at least one should be consistent about it.Comments (573)Randi ZuckerbergFounder and CEO, Zuckerberg Media; Editor-In-Chief, Dot ComplicatedAs parents, if we are going through all this effort to install these apps on our children\u0027s phones, we need to make sure we don\u0027t turn around and engage in the same harmful behavior ourselves.CommentsDr. Judith RodinPresident of the Rockefeller FoundationRisk is philanthropy\u0027s calling card -- it\u0027s what our philanthropic dollars, at least in the United States, are now tax-advantaged to do. If we\u0027re not taking enough risk, we\u0027re clearly not doing everything in our power to maximize impact for the poor or vulnerable.CommentsBurton NewmanAttorney; Adjunct professor, Washington University School of LawFor well over two centuries the Supreme Court never decided that the Amendment granted a constitutional right to individuals to bear arms. The widely held notion that such a right existed was a myth fabricated by the NRA for its own self interest and for the corporate profits of gun manufacturers.Comments (2,263)Erika EichelbergerSenior editorial fellow, Mother JonesSince the Newtown massacre, visions of unfathomable crazy mass killers and armed strangers in the night have colonized the American mind. But you\u0027re more likely to be hurt or killed by someone you know or love. And you\u0027ll probably be at home when it happens.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkAs we teach our youth to put the weapons down and better their lives, what are we to tell them when so many in Washington have failed us so cowardly?Comments (63)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorHere are a few observations on the new immigration reform proposal, with an emphasis on a part that I think is particularly important and largely overlooked given the emphasis on citizenship: the consideration of labor market impacts.CommentsJim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupThe world has seen great progress in getting children into school over the past decade. Yet 61 million children are still out of class -- that\u0027s 61 million too many.CommentsTed KaufmanFmr. U.S. Senator from DelawareThe Obama administration has a big opportunity to get on the right side of history and finally do something about the size, complexity and riskiness of our very largest banks.CommentsHoward FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupWe just saw the Senate, constricted by its own rules and the laser-focused fire of the NRA, being the slaughterhouse of public will.Comments (1,759)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersConventional wisdom continues to hold that, while the vast majority of Americans support universal background checks, in many areas it is still smart politics not to antagonize the NRA and their relatively small number of very passionate -- supporters. Conventional wisdom is wrong.Comments (449)David WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027Watching the events of this past week has been the most brutal reminder imaginable that not everyone in the world shows up to offer support. Some twisted monsters come simply to destroy, and sadly as a society we can never forget that.CommentsMichael WolkowitzCo-Founder Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence; Former Chair, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceFight for more sensible laws regulating firearms we must. We may also need to accept the possibility that we people in the U.S. like to kill each other with guns more than people in many other parts of the world do.Comments (105)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureA recent \"Spreadsheet Scandal\" has rocked the economics world. It also seems to have eliminated the last remaining technical argument in support of the president\u0027s \"chained CPI\" Social Security cut. Not weakened it. Eliminated it.Comments (20)Lloyd I. Sederer, MDMedical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthI asked more than a dozen expert psychiatric colleagues, and myself, the questions they most frequently receive about psychiatric medications from people who take them or their families. Here are a dozen of those many questions; the responses are mine.Comments (13)Benjamin R. BarberDemocratic theorist; Author, \u0027Strong Democracy\u0027, \u0027Jihad vs. McWorld\u0027The problem is with the filibuster, and its evolution from a sometime instrument of supposedly very special causes that occasionally merit slowing down a fast-moving and majority into the everyday recourse of reckless minorities who hold democracy itself in contempt.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The high pay for those at the top does not come out of the air; it comes from everyone else\u0027s paycheck. There is no single policy that would reverse this enormous upward redistribution of income, but reining in CEO pay has to be an important part of the story.Comments (276)Douglas Anthony CooperNovelist, Amnesia (See: Blogger Mortis)Savvy men wear their guns in the house. It\u0027s called \"home carry.\" Why should you unstrap that Glock just because you\u0027ve kissed the wife and kids and hung up your coat? This was a suggestion offered to me recently with complete sincerity.Comments (175)Damien EcholsAuthor, \u0027Life After Death\u0027First, I should probably say that I\u0027m not a big fan of prison shows. Or cop shows. Or lawyer shows. Or courtroom drama shows of any sort. I guess that\u0027s one of the side effects of being sentenced to death for a crime I didn\u0027t commit.Comments (32)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorDespite all the lasting harm caused by the casino capitalists, the big banks are now bigger, richer and more powerful than they were when they were bailed out in late 2008. The only ones who were punished were the U.S. taxpayers.Comments (77)Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaIn the mad dash for readers\u0027 eyeballs, the media often chooses fast over factual. But who are publications serving by being the first to cross an invisible finish line?Comments (34)Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027To acknowledge what really threatens us is to upset two of the most guarded citadels in this country: the military and masculinity. But if you look at leading causes of death and injury for women, the terms \"terrorist\" and \"husband\" should perhaps be interchangeable.Comments (27)Claire McCarthy, M.D.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolI found out about them from my daughter, who was running away from the scene. She was right there, close enough to see the explosions, just yards away.Comments (124)Andy OstroyPolitical \u0026 pop culture analystAmericans, in time of such great tragedy, can be truly awe-inspiring in their unity and resolve. But is that enough? Is it enough to belt out the national anthem for a few days and then return to business as usual?CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027We come together as Americans when confronting common disasters and common threats, but we continue to split apart economically. Almost 1 out of 4 of the nation\u0027s children is in now in poverty, but you wouldn\u0027t know that in Washington.Comments (492)Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013.18.04Katie Shay, 2013.18.04William Laney, 2013.18.04Drew Tillman, 2013.18.04Tony Mckenna, 2013.18.04David Nour, 2013.18.04Anna Maslakovic, 2013.18.04Ann Givens, 2013.18.04Rebekah Iliff, 2013.18.04Chris Krapek, 2013.18.04Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"WANTED",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
