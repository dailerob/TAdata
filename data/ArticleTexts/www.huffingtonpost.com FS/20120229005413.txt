{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressMonths ago, I doubt that there were many people who believed that tonight\u0027s February primaries in Arizona and Michigan were going to be all that pivotal. Depending on how far back you go, this wasn\u0027t even supposed to be a race -- let\u0027s recall that when Florida moved their primary up into the early part of the season, state officials had the notion that they might be the kingmaker. Barring that, of course, the path between the January contests and Super Tuesday featured caucuses in Nevada and Colorado, and a primary in Michigan, and Romney was surely going to win those, right? Well, it hasn\u0027t worked out that way.Read Post | Comments (63)Jamal Abdi and Trita Parsi, 02/28/12Just as with the lead-up to the Iraq War, the pathway to war with Iran will be paved with false assertions, self-fulfilling saber-rattling and political weakness that might seem insignificant now, but will in retrospect turn out to be disastrous.Read Post | Comments (82)Jean Alves, MS, RD, 02.27.2012Nutrition Communications, Quaker Food \u0026 SnacksIf you\u0027re ready to wake up to a better you, here\u0027s some food for thought on how to go from breakfast newbie to enjoying the breakfasts of champions.Read Post | Comments (4)Steve Lombardo, 02/28/12Global CEO, StrategyOneWhen Perry abandoned his run after a disastrous campaign, Romney\u0027s campaign apparatus could breathe a sigh of relief. Well that was premature. Beating Gingrich in Florida was easy compared to this. Santorum in Michigan is a political nightmare for Mitt Romney.Read Post | Comments (37)Donna Brazile, 02/28/12Vice Chair of Voter Registration \u0026 Participation, DNCThe strength, talents and successes of contemporary black women have deeply influenced the Obama Administration and continue to shape American history and improve the lives of all our citizens.Read Post | CommentsLisa Belkin, 02/28/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, Huffington PostI\u0027m the parent who stopped with the baby talk when my boys were technically still babies, who counted the superfluous use of \"like\" in their sentences, and who made them repeat any statement they\u0027d contorted into a question. Linguists say I was fighting evolution.Read Post | CommentsDoug Bandow, 02/28/12Senior Fellow at the Cato InstituteWhat should be done if there are no obvious battlefields and no certain combatants? Should propagandists be treated as fighters? Are any procedural protections required before a U.S. citizen can be killed?Read Post | Comments (18)Jared Bernstein, 02/28/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesCharles Murray is right: in important ways we\u0027re coming apart and that\u0027s a serious danger demanding the attention of social scientists, policy makers, and persons of all income classes. The problem with his book is that if you\u0027ve been paying any attention, you knew that already.Read Post | CommentsNadia Tonova, 02/28/12Director, National Network for Arab American CommunitiesAt the Oscars, Sacha Baron Cohen buffooned as a fictitious Arab dictator to promote a film. There was plenty of buzz over the fact that he made a mess of Seacrest\u0027s Burberry tuxedo, but not about the blatant Arab stereotype.Read Post | CommentsJeff Schweitzer, 02/28/12Scientist; Fmr. White House Senior Policy AnalystBlaming Obama for the collapsing economy and declining stock market he inherited was to be the primary strategy for Republicans in the presidential election. But, oh, how strange that is (even before being made obsolete by a recovery).Read Post | CommentsAnthony D. Romero, 02/28/12Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionFrom trying to put government-sponsored prayer and creationism in our schools to the controversy over allowing employers to discriminate against women, Santorum\u0027s career has been marked by opposition to the First Amendment\u0027s wall between government and religious institutions.Read Post | Comments (13)Janet Tavakoli, 02/28/12President, Tavakoli Structured FinanceSince the September 2008 financial crisis, we\u0027ve seen a pattern of misdeeds, dodgy financial reporting, congressional \"investigations\" that are all for show, slow and incompetent investigations, and ultimately a slap on the wrist for wrong-doers.Read Post | Comments (53)Anne Goddard, 02/27/12President and CEO, ChildFund InternationalMust we make an economic argument as to why protecting the most vulnerable people in a society should be a matter of highest priority? Is a moral argument insufficient?Read Post | CommentsStephen F. Cohen, 02/28/12Professor, Russian Studies at New York University; Author, \u0027Soviet Fates and Lost Alternatives\u0027The United States and Russia are at a potentially fateful crossroads in their relations. Twenty years after the end of the Soviet Union, the relationship features more elements of cold-war conflict than of stable cooperation.Read Post | CommentsPatrick Garratt, 02/28/12Video Games and Tech JournalistIf Facebook\u0027s the mainstream social gateway, Twitter\u0027s the hard stuff. Everything about it provides instant, constant gratification. Nothing epitomises \u0027f5 syndrome\u0027 - the desire to repeatedly refresh a webpage or app - better than Twitter.Read Post | CommentsSen. Ron Wyden, 02/28/12U.S. Senator from OregonIf China is violating trade rules to help its industries undercut the price of solar panels and other environmental goods, it changes the competition from a race to produce better products more efficiently to a competition to cheat better.Read Post | Comments (41)Simon Johns, 02/28/12Dispatches from the edge of EuropeDespite the constraints they face, Baklahorani demonstrates that, at least on the street level, Greeks are more comfortable about expressing their identity. Istanbulites have in recent years begun celebrating the city\u0027s native culture.Read Post | CommentsTed Kaufman, 02/28/12Fmr. U.S. Senator from DelawareThere are lots of catch-22s in this terrible crisis, and they should have been taken into account when the eurozone was first established.Read Post | CommentsFrancine Shapiro, Ph.D., 02/28/12Director, EMDR Institute; Senior Research Fellow, Mental Research Institute; Founder, EMDR Humanitarian Assistance ProgramsWe\u0027ve all heard the phrase \"life is suffering.\" Unfortunately, some people misinterpret this to mean there is nothing they can do about their unhappiness.Read Post | CommentsAndrea Kane, 02/28/12Senior Director for Policy, National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned PregnancyThe current, senseless uproar has revealed a profound lack of understanding about contraception and how it actually works for real women. Most unsettling is that some of these men are opining about, and in some cases legislating for, changes that would harm women\u0027s health.Read Post | CommentsMichael Brenner, 02/28/12Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe Republicans who have been tearing themselves apart have done so not over ideological differences, but rather in a fang-and-claw fight to see who can conjure the most reactionary image. It is the usual exercise in minimalism.Read Post | Comments (171)Blake Driver, 02/28/12Freelance writerThough the co-owner of New Mexico\u0027s largest gay nightclub has received criticism for her work as a congressional staffer for former Republican congresswoman Heather Wilson, she charges on as an undaunted LGBT torchbearer.Read Post | CommentsValerie Jarrett, 02/28/12Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public EngagementWhen women are denied the chance to contribute because of domestic violence our entire society suffers. When women have a chance to achieve their dreams, everybody benefits. When women succeed, society as a whole does better.Read Post | CommentsAli Schofield, 02/29/12Magazine editor and freelance writerToday marks a leap year; it\u0027s the only day women are allowed to propose and, according to centuries-old tradition, their potential husbands aren\u0027t allowed to say no. This sentence is all kinds of cringe.Read Post | CommentsLimari Colon, 02/28/12Part-time writer, full-time breastfeeding momWaving your cute butt in front of your wife will not do anything for your sex life. Doing the dishes, the laundry and putting the baby to sleep... Now that will raise more than an eyebrow or two.Read Post | CommentsAlon Ben-Meir, 02/28/12Senior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsIsrael would not have found itself seriously deliberating to undertake a preventive military strike against Iran\u0027s nuclear facilities without U.S. approval had the Obama administration acted more resolutely much earlier.Read Post | Comments (168)Bernard-Henri Lévy, 02/28/12French philosopher and writerThere is a moment when, confronted with the carnage, the trifle of 8000 dead, victims of Bashar al-Assad\u0027s tanks, the dismal sideshow of this referendum supposedly organized, what\u0027s more, under the hail of shells and sniper fire, one must have the elementary dignity to say, \"Stop!\"Read Post | Comments (106)Ali Schofield, 2012.29.02Simon Johns, 2012.28.02Joel Braunold, 2012.28.02Kate Bryan, 2012.28.02Rosi Prescott, 2012.28.02Sarah McGiven, 2012.28.02Patrick Garratt, 2012.28.02Siobhan Benita, 2012.28.02Hugh Salmon, 2012.28.02Steven Kolacny, 2012.28.02","h1":"Using a mobile device?
