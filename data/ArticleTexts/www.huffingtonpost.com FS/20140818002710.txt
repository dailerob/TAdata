{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, all eyes were on Ferguson, Missouri, where unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by a white police officer. Further inflaming matters was the way largely peaceful protests of the shooting were met with tear gas and armored vehicles (and the arrest of journalists, including HuffPost\u0027s Ryan Reilly). This hyper-aggressive response raised bipartisan alarm about the militarization of America\u0027s police forces, which have received $4.3 billion in military hardware -- including 435 armored vehicles and 93,763 machine guns -- since 2006. This arms buildup partially grew out of the War on Drugs, which has largely become a war on young black and brown men; 50 percent of those impacted by SWAT raids are black and Latino. Though Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson helped restore calm to Ferguson by boldly replacing pointed assault rifles with hugs, handshakes and active listening, the simmering issues of race and how we police our communities cry out for a larger national conversation.If he had had a heart attack, if had lost a long fight with cancer, if he had been knocked over by a car, would there be a need for a debate about \u0027what this says about the state of heart disease, or cancer care or road safety\u0027? Possibly, but I doubt it. There still needs to be debate about depression as an illness, because there is still a lack of understanding that illness is exactly what it is.Author and former head of communications to Tony BlairPolice in general get a bad rap, and the vast majority are good, loyal souls. But their training and the institutional mentality they come from often leads to a warped perspective of how they function within communities that they do not live in.Founder, GlobalGrind.comWe will be able to stop Ebola in the coming weeks and months. But that is not the end of the story. Will we also build a strong enough health system to stop the next outbreak? We believe that it is a moral and economic imperative to do so, and all of us must work toward that goal.President, World Bank GroupChairperson of the African UnionChildhood development guides tell us that 2-year-olds traditionally begin to exhibit growing independence and openly defiant behavior. Well, HuffPost Live, which turns 2 years old today, has been defiantly independent since it launched.Relations between police and African-American communities across our country may be at its worst since the 1960s. What do public officials in the police department in Ferguson fear?Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityIt\u0027s pretty basic. Belief in the supremacy of civilian control over the armed forces is the cornerstone of American democracy. The institutional failure evident in Ferguson, MO is a sign of civilian dereliction.I\u0027m that homecoming queen who played DnDIt\u0027s said that the best defense is a good offense. This strategy probably lies behind Hillary Clinton\u0027s recent takedown of President Barack Obama\u0027s foreign policy. After all, Clinton was a lead architect of that policy as Secretary of State, and the policies that she espoused until recently now lie in shambles.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"The trouble with suicide is that no one knows what to say. No one knows how to react. So they smile and wave and attempt distraction... but they never ever say the word. The survivors, it seems, are often left to survive on their own.Child and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertSeaWorld, as we know it today, is over. It\u0027s only a matter of time. The company is finished. Here\u0027s why.Co-founder of the Huffington PostIf we do not prosecute and discipline officers who break the law and who abuse their positions, then what sort of message does that send to the others? What kind of police culture does that create?President, National Action NetworkSince the dawn of the 20th century, Australia and the US have stood together with a shared vision for a free, peaceful and prosperous world. Today we reaffirm our confidence that the relationship will continue to be a force for good in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, and the world.U.S. Secretary of StateUnited States Secretary of DefenseWelcome to a new era of American policing, where cops increasingly see themselves as soldiers occupying enemy territory, often with the help of Uncle Sam\u0027s armory, and where even nonviolent crimes are met with overwhelming force and brutality.Journalist/WriterIf comic brilliance could be converted to nuclear energy, Robin Williams would have qualified as a one-man power plant. Lightning-quick, wildly unpredictable, and possessed by a endless cast of characters and voices -- on stage and off -- Robin couldn\u0027t help but be funny. That\u0027s what drew us to him, of course. He gave us joy.Award-winning actress, author and activistEven though I had not spoken with Robin in a very long time, I always assumed there would be some future opportunity to tell him that his letter changed my life. It taught me that you stand up for the things that matter. And even if your attempts fail, you tried. You told the truth. You took care of your friends. You fought back.Author, former child actorWhite Americans like me have to stop channel surfing all the outrageously bad news from around the world and focus on the death that is happening in our own cities to our fellow Americans.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostHere lies a racial disparity that\u0027s difficult for honest people to ignore. How can black people openly carry a real gun when we can\u0027t even pick up a BB gun in a store without arousing suspicion? The answer in America is that the Second Amendment doesn\u0027t really apply to black people.CNBC contributor, MSNBC commentator and former White House aideHealing from self-blame for wrong done to you is possible, especially through a compassionate connection. I have hardly ever seen this demonstrated as well as in the film Good Will Hunting, starring Robin Williams and Matt Damon.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryMr. Williams\u0027s electric presence, comic genius and comforting fallibility made him not only a great actor, but, perhaps, an emotional bridge from which the Millennials and their parents, the Boomers, could come together, better aware of their collective imperfections and differences.Senior/International Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWe should care a great deal about the Ebola outbreak, but not for the reasons propagated by cable news. We should care about Ebola for what it says about the current state of the health care system in resource-limited settings around the globe.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolAs we celebrate our collective love of sharks, we should also take a moment to reflect on the many threats that sharks face. Sharks are in trouble -- and while we\u0027ve made a lot of progress protecting them, we still need your help.ActressCEO, OceanaNothing has as much impact as the moving image. It stirs our passions, our outrage. The written words or the talking heads that could perhaps explain the overall situation can\u0027t change the narrative... the most potent images will win the day.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerAs we take in the tragedy of Robin Williams\u0027 passing, we should also reject the shambles that is mental health care for most Americans. If there is an \"if only\" that makes sense, it is a societal one.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027The disturbing nature of the frequency of recent news reports in which unarmed Black men have been killed by law enforcement officers is only exceeded by this fact: the act itself is deeply embedded into the racial fabric of our nation.Author, \u0027FREESTYLE: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture\u0027; Founding Pastor, Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church, Dallas, TexasWhen I finally saw the final movie with the music in there, it was kind of overwhelming. It was a very gratifying experience to see that it was done with such regard for the book. It retains the essential ingredients of the book, while adding all of the visual stuff that a movie needs but that a book sadly cannot have.Author, \u0027The Giver\u0027Is advising women going off to college -- or out dancing, for that matter -- to be as safe as they can be given what we know about our dangerous world, filled with dangerous people, a way of condoning victim-blaming? Or is it simply encouraging good common sense?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhen she was 15 years old, Malala Yousafzai dared to speak out against the Taliban. Her father offers a window into a world where girls aren\u0027t allowed to leave the house, let alone speak their minds -- and he makes a plea for change.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"I don\u0027t know you. I don\u0027t know your story. But I do know that you don\u0027t need to watch every hop, skip, jump, twirl, swing, bite, song, dance, blink or breath to be a good mom.Writer, RealLifeParentingBlog.comThe first thing that struck me about Haiti was the chaos. While much of the rubble has been cleared from the streets and the earthquake is four and a half years behind them, millions of Haitians are still living in grinding poverty.Actress and Concern Worldwide Global AmbassadorHas America\u0027s moral arc bent toward justice over the last half century? By some measures, it appears not.Actor, \u0027M*A*S*H\u0027 and \u0027Providence\u0027We know the commonly repeated claim that there are more Black men in prison than in college isn\u0027t true--but in 2011 Black men accounted for fewer than 6 percent of undergraduate students and 4 percent of graduate students, though they made up 8.7 percent of 18-29 year olds.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"ALL EYES ON MIDNIGHT",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
