{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesThe New Yorker\u0027s Ryan Lizza provides a profile of Rep. Paul Ryan, with a rich discussion of his vision for limited government. It\u0027s a good read, but it left me thinking about what it is that troubles me most about Rep. Ryan, an earnest guy who\u0027s come a long way and influenced a lot of people at a relatively young age. The problem is his numbers don\u0027t add up. And that\u0027s a particularly big problem for a celebrated budget wonk. It\u0027s actually not hard to write down plans that purport to quantify Ayn Randian visions. But we should beware of politicians pumped up on ideological visions stoked by novelists and fairy tales about how slashing taxes and spending sets us free. The world is more complicated than that.Read Post | Comments (153)Brian Levin, J.D., 08/06/12Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWe will soon find out more about Wade Michael Page and the motives behind this horrendous atrocity, which shocked the sensibilities of our pluralistic democracy. One thing is certain, lone wolves, have been and remain a significant domestic terror risk that is difficult to thwart.Read Post | Comments (95)Andy Monshaw, 08.06.2012General Manager of IBM Midmarket BusinessThese days, the big box chains aren\u0027t the only ones using social media to drive sales.Read Post | CommentsSimran Jeet Singh, 08/05/12Doctoral Candidate in Religion, Columbia UniversityConsidering the various challenges our communities have overcome, as well as my own experiences of growing up in Texas, I have no reason to believe that Sikh and American identities are mutually exclusive.Read Post | Comments (399)Bhakti Shringarpure, 08/06/12Editor, Warscapes magazineThe urban mom is obsessed with making a science of parenting. This is healthy and completely normal. But here is where I draw the line: looking for solutions through cultural stereotyping and engaging in quasi-racist discourse under the guise of doing what\u0027s best for your child.Read Post | Comments (11)Jeffrey Sachs, 08/06/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027The economic problems in the U.S. and Eurozone are mostly structural, not monetary. Unfortunately ideologues and politicians on both sides of the spectrum are interested in quick fixes rather than the real groundwork of economic progress.Read Post | Comments (159)Norman Lear, 08/06/12Founder, People for the American WayI just got my first letter from Mitt Romney. I can\u0027t tell you what that means to me. For so long I have wanted a president who believes in America. He calls me \"one of America\u0027s most notable Republicans\" when I haven\u0027t given 10 cents to him or the party.Read Post | CommentsRiddhi Shah, 08/07/12Editor, Good NewsIf we don\u0027t ask why a small religious community in the Midwest was targeted by a 40-year-old white man, if we don\u0027t make this discussion as loud and robust as the one that followed the attack on those young people in Aurora, we\u0027re in danger of undermining what America stands for.Read Post | CommentsNatalie Gregg, 08/04/12Family lawyer, Entrepreneur and Mother of TwoHere are 10 Simple, True-or-False questions to ask if you are considering divorce.Read Post | Comments (199)Michael B. Keegan, 08/06/12President, People For the American WayHere\u0027s a simple idea for the media: don\u0027t equate Ann Coulter\u0027s vitriol with analysis. And most importantly, realize that when you invite her to spew ill-informed extremism on your program, that\u0027s exactly what you\u0027re going to get.Read Post | Comments (98)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 08/06/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostYes, Sikhs are not Muslims and Sikhs are not Hindus, but jumping to clarify difference leaves the unfortunate, if unintentional, perception that there is something wrong with those \"others.\"Read Post | Comments (132)Andrew Parasiliti, 08/06/12Executive director, International Institute for Strategic Studies-USUnless Romney changes tack, Obama will win the foreign policy debate without breaking a sweat. This would be unfortunate, because there is in fact a debate to be had about national security, and Romney has in fact begun that conversation.Read Post | Comments (29)Terry O\u0027Neill, 08/06/12President, National Organization for WomenThe first thing women should know about the Romney-Ryan budget is that it has been called the single largest transfer of wealth from middle- and low-income earners to millionaires and billionaires in our country\u0027s history.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 08/05/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027If you watched any of the PBS encore broadcast of the Ken Burns documentary, The War, this past week, you have some sense of what kind of a production machine can be energized by government contracts in the face of a depressed economy.Read Post | Comments (508)Glenn W. Smith, 08/06/12Author, consultant, Director, Progress Texas PACA portrait of America under Tea Party rule runs the risk of reading like dystopian science fiction. So be it. We should take the risk because a future Tea Party America would likely be such a dystopia, a place even tea partiers might fear to tread.Read Post | Comments (194)Maya Rupert, 08/06/12Federal Policy Director, National Center for Lesbian RightsAccording to the new IOC rules, the test won\u0027t be administered to all female athletes but only when \"the chief medical officer of a national Olympic committee or a member of the IOC\u0027s medical commission requests it.\" This will disadvantage any woman perceived as not sufficiently feminine.Read Post | CommentsClaire McCarthy, M.D., 08/06/12Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolIt\u0027s really important to teach kids to be safe -- to make sure that they never go anywhere with anyone without telling you, for example. But please, please, don\u0027t squelch their friendliness.Read Post | CommentsMark Gongloff, 08/06/12Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostYou might think the experience of pulling Knight Capital out of the flaming wreckage of its high-speed trading crash might make Wall Street finally see the need for regulation of high-speed trading. You would of course be dead wrong.Read Post | Comments (25)Patricia Crisafulli, 08/06/12Author, founder, FaithHopeandFiction.comOne day last week, I took the 11:50am train to Chicago for an 11:45am lunch. No, that\u0027s not a typographical error, nor are there any time-zone adjustments or wormholes in space involved. This clear case of mental meltdown is a symptom of an affliction I call five kinds of crazy.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 08/06/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The CEOs seeking to cut back or dismantle Social Security and Medicare can probably outspend the defenders of these programs 10 to 1. However, there is still the simple fact that the voters overwhelmingly support these programs.Read Post | Comments (31)Seamus McKiernan, 08/06/12Associate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWe didn\u0027t invent hatred or fear of the Other. The difference is that in America, guns -- even military-grade assault weapons -- are legal and easy to acquire. Hate, plus unregulated guns, is a deadly equation. And one that has the potential to curtail free expression.Read Post | Comments (277)Deepak Sarma, 08/05/12Professor of South Asian Religions and Philosophy, Case Western Reserve UniversityIf the United States is supposed to be a melting pot, a place of tolerance, a country for the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free, then no one should stand out or be the target for looking different.Read Post | Comments (322)Michelangelo Signorile, 08/06/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; SiriusXM radio hostOur enemies distorted our message and reframed the story. And we allowed them to do it. How did we allow it to happen? Because there was no coordinated effort on our side.Read Post | Comments (682)John W. Whitehead, 08/06/12Attorney and AuthorWhat happened to Michael Salman -- armed police raids of his property, repeated warnings against holding any form of Bible study at his home, and a court-ordered probation banning him from having any gatherings of more than 12 people at his home -- should never have happened in America.Read Post | Comments (25)Nikki Stone, 08/05/12Olympic gold medalist and bestselling authorIt was always the memory of those athletes that helped me persevere through hard times and push past insurmountable obstacles -- and believe me, there were many. And ten years later, I was walking into my own Olympic Opening Ceremonies.Read Post | CommentsChris Powell, 08/03/12Trainer/Transformation Specialist on ABC’s \u0027Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition\u0027Plateaus happen, at least to those who don\u0027t plan so they can prevent them! Fight back and prevent the plateau, or if you\u0027re already hitting that wall, it\u0027s time to trick the body and relight your metabolism.Read Post | Comments (24)Gary Hart, 08/04/12President, Hart International, Ltd.There is a constant chorus respecting the freedom of speech. Little is heard respecting the right to remain silent. But many more Americans remain silent than speak, for more reasons than we can count. All of which are fine, except silence conveys assent.Read Post | Comments (291)Riddhi Shah, 2012. 7.08Lincee Ray, 2012. 7.08Gov. Jennifer M.
