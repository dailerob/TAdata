{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonOne year ago today, we launched HuffPost Live, our live-streaming network, inviting you all to join, as I put it then, \"a different kind of conversation.\" Our goal was to create the most social video experience possible -- allowing members of the HuffPost community to speak out on the issues that matter most to them, on equal footing with newsmakers, celebrities, pundits, and experts. Things have gone even better than we\u0027d hoped. Since HuffPost Live launched, over 9,600 guests from more than 85 countries have joined us live on-air, and thousands more have joined the conversation via our interactive social tools, leaving 1.3 million comments on the HuffPost Live platform. If you haven\u0027t made HuffPost Live a regular part of your HuffPost diet, please check it out. And if you have, please keep watching... and letting us know what you think. Happy birthday, HuffPost Live. Here\u0027s to many, many more!Comments (13)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe American judiciary exists, first and foremost, to protect the constitutional rights of those who are not in the majority. It exists to ensure that our government treats all of us with respect.Comments (434)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The news in the last couple of weeks has had endless references to two people who we have been repeatedly told are brilliant: Larry Summers and Jeff Bezos. The paeans to the genius of both men say a great deal about the quality of public debate in elite circles.Comments (123)Katie HurleyChild and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertLife is far too scripted today. Plans are made. Classes are attended. Craft projects are intended to mimic those found on Pinterest. Gone are the days of free play and creating something out of nothing. Many kids today are simply following a script.Comments (153)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027How do you justify criminally charging a government contractor for revealing an alarming truth that the public has every right to know?Comments (371)James PonsoldtDirector\"To know Lloyd Dobler is to love him. Diane Court is about to know Lloyd Dobler.\" A perfect tagline to the definitive American teen romance of the 1980s.Comments (110)Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderIt seems logical to me that the same way I try to teach my kids to exercise, sleep well and be good people, I would teach them to have healthy sex and sleep with other good people.Comments (283)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comJoe, like much else in his era, was hardly what he seemed. Launched the year Lyndon Johnson ran for president as a peace candidate against Barry Goldwater while his administration was secretly planning the large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, Joe, too, was involved in a cover-up.Comments (30)Carol J. CarterAuthor and student success expertThe need to improve writing and reading skills linked to writing and thinking is urgent; we need to improve these skills so that our future generation will have the skills to communicate whether they are fixing furnaces, fixing bridges, fixing computer hacks, or fixing heart valves.Comments (11)Robin S. Rosenberg, Ph.D.Clinical psychologistEven casual fans of superheroes are intrigued by some of the issues raised in superhero stories--issues of morality and justice, of personality and identity. As with any good fiction that endures, we resonate with the superhero characters, and their stories spark our imaginations.Comments (17)Jamie McGonnigalCommunity Engagement Manager, New Organizing InstituteInstead of actually standing up for LGBT athletes, the IOC is essentially siding with Russia and issuing a warning to lesbian and gay athletes. The IOC has made it clear that they have a double standard when it comes to accepting all athletes.Comments (187)Food RiotPlay with your food.Is it me, or has the foodternet recently exploded with recipes and how-tos for cold-brew coffee, as if the notion is somehow brand new? How is this even a thing right now?CommentsKeith Lawrence and Gretchen SusiCriminalization was one of the many tools white Americans used to limit the social inclusion of people of color during the eras of slavery and Jim Crow, since recognition of their full humanity would have significantly undermined the racial order. The criminalization we have been witnessing in recent decades has been more sophisticated but its racial outcomes are the same: the establishment of a visible and psychological connection between racial identity, crime, and place.Comments (12)John K. HerrSpeechwriter and standup comedianWho killed rock-n-roll? The question will keep forensic scientists busy until Axl Rose is cloned and does it right this time.Comments (18)Jason SattlerExecutive Editor, NationalMemo.com -- @LOLGOP on Twitter\"No one is advocating a government shutdown,\" Cantor told the National Review\u0027s Robert Costa on Friday. Maybe he\u0027s calling these three prominent senators \"no one\" or maybe he hasn\u0027t been paying attention.Comments (43)Candace WalshAuthor, \u0027Licking the Spoon: A Memoir of Food, Family, and Identity\u0027When you\u0027re walking along in a strange city, and you\u0027ve studied the map and think you know where you\u0027re going, there\u0027s a period of time when you\u0027re actually going the wrong way but you haven\u0027t figured it out yet.CommentsAlison van DiggelenHost, FreshDialoguesSome call Elon Musk\u0027s plans for The Hyperloop \"insane,\" others call it \"genius,\" but the question remains: What\u0027s going on inside Musk\u0027s head and where does he get his wild ideas? It\u0027s a question I put to Musk during an in-depth interview.CommentsRichard CrepeauHistory Professor, University of Central FloridaThe Biogenesis case raises many other questions concerning drug use in sports. We live in world in which science and technology have altered the definition of what is normal, and blurred categories of what is or is not possible. These questions are not going away after the Biogenesis case vanishes.CommentsHulu.comWatchers of Good TVSometimes, the truly sinister villains are the ones that speckle your everyday life -- and a lot of the time, they\u0027re not what, or who, you\u0027d expect.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Why is there more anger, vituperation, and political polarization now than even during Joe McCarthy\u0027s anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s, the tempestuous struggle for civil rights in the 1960s, the divisive Vietnam war, or the Watergate scandal?Comments (1,560)Rabbi David WolpeAuthor and Rabbi of Sinai Temple in Los AngelesThe accumulation of small moments of connection, goodness, wisdom and love are together a triumph, no matter the external measures that may at time derail or dismay us.Comments (31)Lisa ParkinSocial Media Consultant, YA Book BloggerNothing against the youth of today, but... aren\u0027t there some adults with real world experience who could, you know, jump in with the whole saving humanity thing?Comments (37)Cole Bates-Norum and Jennifer NorumIf NYU continues shutting out students who can\u0027t afford its full tuition, it will end up with a homogenous, non-diverse student body. Then again, perhaps that\u0027s the point.Comments (31)Timothy KarrCampaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comAs CBS and Time Warner Cable remain locked in a three-week battle over retransmission fees, you have to wonder when their millions of viewers will throw in the towel and abandon cable altogether.Comments (60)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgNot confused enough yet about how much health insurance might cost some of us next year when the consumer protections in Obamacare kick in? Just wait. It\u0027s likely you\u0027ll soon be far more confused -- and alarmed -- than you already are.Comments (307)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkParents and grandparents in this city are tired of having to warn their children about both criminals and the police. Do we want to see crime reduced? Absolutely, because they are doing it to us. But don\u0027t criminalize us at the same time.Comments (284)Richey PiiparinenWriter, Senior Consultant at Strategic Urban Solutions, Co-editor, \u0027Rust Belt Chic: The Cleveland Anthology\u0027Nothing. Seriously. Not a damn thing.Oh, the occasion is being used to opine on our state of affairs, but nothing is structurally taking shape in America to prevent the next Detroit from occurring. In fact, Detroit is occurring every day inside most of us. We are all getting bankrupt in so many little ways.Comments (70)Heather Taylor-MiesleDirector, NRDC Action FundRepresentative Blackburn is free to attack a solution that will save Americans money and help curb climate change, but I still can\u0027t help wonder: Why would she want to?Comments (77)Gov. Jack MarkellGovernor of DelawareMy blueprint is designed to give governors tools to increase employment of people with disabilities in their states. Based on input from business leaders, it suggests that states change their approach.CommentsSen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth WarrenThe next Fed chair will have an opportunity to get our economy back on track and to help rebuild America\u0027s middle class. But that will require the right temperament and a willingness to take on Wall Street CEOs when necessary.Comments (930)Vivian Diller, Ph.D.Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027I\u0027m frequently asked about the online dating process, an increasingly popular means by which relationships start. Many report that online photos play a key role in getting the process started. Whether it\u0027s visual chemistry or love at first sight, your photo says a lot about you.CommentsLorri L.
