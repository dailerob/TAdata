{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Adam WinklerProfessor of Law, UCLAYesterday\u0027s gubernatorial election in Virginia was a remarkable setback for the Virginia-based National Rifle Association. Democrat Terry McAuliffe beat Republican Ken Cuccinelli, despite McAuliffe\u0027s support of expansive new gun control laws, like universal background checks and limits on assault rifles and high-capacity magazine. Indeed, McAuliffe had an \"F\" rating from the NRA, compared to Cuccinelli\u0027s \"A\" rating. And yet, even in a state with a lot of rural, pro-gun voters, McAuliffe emerged victorious. McAuliffe\u0027s victory is a boon to gun control advocates.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Pundits who are already describing the victories of Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and Chris Christie in New Jersey as a \"return to the center\" of American politics are confusing the \"center\" with big business and Wall Street.Comments (208)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorMake no mistake: In New York City, the drive to privatize public education has ground to a halt with Bill de Blasio\u0027s election. He now has the opportunity to provide national leadership to the growing movement to rebuild and strengthen public education as a fundamental institution in our democratic society.Comments (14)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowOkay, I get it. The Healthcare.gov website is still glitchy; there are evidently people who are losing their current health insurance plans; premiums continue to rise; and the Republicans along with irresponsible members of the press are blowing it entirely out proportion. Enough!Comments (733)David JenkinsPresident of ConservAmerica EFIf Ted Cruz and company\u0027s government shutdown exercise is exhibit A for what is ailing the Republican Party, Terry McAuliffe\u0027s victory over Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia\u0027s gubernatorial race should be exhibit B.Comments (131)Samantha MattBlogger, ForeverTwentySomethings.comIn 10 years you\u0027re forced to go from being this adult-child still living under the same roof as your parents to a real live adult maybe living with a partner (maybe even with a child!). To successfully maneuver your way through your 20s, you have to change. It\u0027s science.Comments (58)Raja FarahGay, atheist, activist, pacifist Arab (among other horrible things); blogger, ohmyhappiness.comHamed Sinno, the openly gay frontman of the Lebanese band Mashrou3 Leila, is gay. His gay voice represents the entire Arab world. Through his gay songs he captures the angst of the youth, singing about things no one gay has ever sung about in a gay way.CommentsChez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentLast night in Lexington, Kentucky, Rand Paul addressed a crowd of supporters and spoke forcefully about the accusations of plagiarism being leveled at him. Here is the full text of his speech.Comments (37)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenWithout the votes of women, Virginia would have elected a Governor who opposes safe and legal abortion, wants to restrict access to affordable health care for women, supports extreme and dangerous fetal personhood measures and calls the birth control health care benefit a \"sterilization mandate.\"Comments (38)Kathy RoseEditor at Human Rights WatchIn the free-wheeling \u002760s, those of us who considered ourselves activists used to joke about surveillance. If you were on the phone and heard a click, you\u0027d make some crack about the FBI listening in and go right on talking.CommentsRep. Alan GraysonU.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictIn September, on national TV, I said that \"I am very disturbed by this idea that whenever we see something bad in the world, we should bomb it.\" Last week I felt even more disturbed, when I met some of the victims of that brutal idea.CommentsJudi DenchActressTo me it is astounding that Philomena Lee still has her strong religious belief even after everything that was done to her. She questions things and is very open in speaking about her experiences, but her faith is unshakeable -- as strong as it always was.Comments (16)Brendan MilewskiDetroit FirefighterWhat\u0027s happening in Detroit is about more than retirement and health care coverage. It\u0027s about the kind of communities we want to live in -- the kind where we keep our promises to each other, and where we put the interests of working families ahead of big banks and wealthy CEOs.CommentsMichael BolenHuffPost Canada News EditorRob Ford isn\u0027t a mistake. We like to think Canada is a tolerant nation, but the mayor\u0027s pride and prejudice is an accurate reflection of much of the city he leads.Comments (277)Katie MortonAuthor, 10 Steps to a Blissful Life and teacher at The Monarch CompanyPeople with extraordinary willpower look objectively at other people\u0027s success, admire the hard work that went into it, and use that as inspiration.Comments (13)Robert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyCutting the Pentagon budget is in the interests of the vast majority of Americans who would rather that our tax dollars be used for domestic needs -- including by lowering taxes on working people -- than for foreign wars, foreign military bases, and exotic science fiction weapons systems.CommentsTiya MilesChair, Department of Afroamerican and African Studies, University of MichiganWhiteness has been a privileged and prized identity in the U.S.; our national culture has made it this way. So when black men select white women and de-select black women, they are doing so in a context of charged racial meanings.Comments (354)Richard C. LeoneSenior Fellow and Fmr. President, The Century FoundationGovernor Chris Christie is entitled to a round of congratulations for having solidly won reelection in the Garden state this week. But those celebrations ought to be tempered by at least some perspective on his margin.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkMany of us were excited last night, and that\u0027s a normal sentiment when such tremendous progress took place. But in order to continue on that path of advancement for all, we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent.Comments (17)Marcus SamuelssonAward-Winning Chef, Restaurateur \u0026 AuthorCharlie Trotter was the consummate chef. As a role model, mentor and great friend to so many of us chefs around the world, he will never be replaced. And for those of us lucky enough to eat at his tables, let\u0027s forever consider ourselves grateful.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027What if we didn\u0027t let them get away with it? Next time someone uses one of these techniques on you, I hope you\u0027ll be more likely to recognize it, and resist.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsMaya Enista SmithYouth and Communities Advisor, Lady Gaga\u0027s Born This Way FoundationOn Sunday, I ran the New York City Marathon. You can file that under things I never thought that I would do, but here I am, icing my knees with frozen broccoli stir fry and hobbling down stairs.CommentsBill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolObamacare is not going to be repealed -- not now and not in the future. However, there is real risk it could collapse under its own weight. Whether or not you support this president, this could seriously harm the health of our citizens and America\u0027s fiscal stability.Comments (38)Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeBill de Blasio won a landslide victory to become the mayor of New York City, voters in New Jersey and Seatac, Washington supported minimum wage hikes, and the Illinois legislature voted to legalize same-sex marriage. These are among the progressive victories that swept across the country.Comments (111)Dan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027Because our attention can so easily be pulled away from what we want to focus on--our work, say, or the person in front of us--we need to me more intentional in taking back control. Here are some ways.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesENDA has a problem: a disturbing religious exemption that has been included in the bill in one form or another ever since it was introduced in 1994. A Catholic school teacher who\u0027s done a great job for years could still be fired under ENDA if the principal discovers that she is a lesbian. That\u0027s abhorrent.CommentsDawn LaguensExecutive vice president, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood Federation of AmericaBut most people will see the lesson of the election clearly: You can\u0027t win an election without women, and most women just aren\u0027t going to vote for someone who wants to strip away our rights, and take us back to the 1950s.CommentsGlenn OBrienEditor, \"The Cool School: Writing from America\u0027s Hip Underground\"There were always hipsters, going back to Socrates and Diogenes at least, but the modern hipster became solidified as a social archetype after the war, the big one, ended, and everybody started to pick out their own clothes and catch up on liberal arts and jazz.CommentsDavid HalperinAttorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgThe lobbying group of America\u0027s for-profit colleges, APSCU, announced today that Michael Dakduk is its new Vice President of Military and Veterans Affairs.
