{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom bu.eduFrom jschumacher.typepad.comAP/victorynh.comA growing number of Democratic leaders are using Iraq for Sale to call attention to the GOP\u0027s failure to reign in the contractor abuse and fraud that have been the hallmark of the Iraq war privatization fiasco. It\u0027s also allowed them to go on the offensive and reframe the national security debate -- showing how the Republicans sacrificed the well-being of our troops and the Iraqi people on the altar of rewarding their corporate backers. I can\u0027t help but picture these newly emboldened Dems as campaign ninjas, but instead of throwing deadly pointed stars, they are flinging Iraq for Sale DVDs -- carving up the idea that the GOP is more patriotic, more concerned about America\u0027s soldiers, and more able to keep us safe.READ POST | comments (53)10.19.2006 Marty KaplanJonah Goldberg must think that his declaration -- \"The Iraq war was a mistake\" -- will hit the nation like a thunderclap.READ POST | comments10.19.2006 Bill DiamondWynn\u0027s reaction upon discovering the two three-inch-long rips was reported to be, \"Oh shit.
