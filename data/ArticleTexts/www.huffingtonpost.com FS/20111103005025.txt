{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m haunted by a passage in Ron Suskind\u0027s Confidence Men in which Paul Volcker questions whether Obama and his economic team are really serious about the financial crisis and is reminded of a phrase that he knew Lawrence Summers sometimes used: \"the important thing is just to be caught trying.\" \"Be caught trying.\" Is there a better description of the mindset of so many of our political leaders at this troubled moment in our nation\u0027s history? The fact that there\u0027s a crisis, and that people are hurting -- or at least that the people are angry -- has finally sunk in around official Washington. And everyone there wants to be caught trying to do something about it.

This isn\u0027t just about helping those in need; this is about helping keep our society strong.Read Post | Comments (37)David Frum, 11/2/11Editor, FrumForum.comTo put it mildly, poverty alleviation has not been a Republican theme in the current cycle.
