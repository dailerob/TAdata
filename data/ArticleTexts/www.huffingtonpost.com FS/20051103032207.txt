{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/CSPANFrom horaz.comYou\u0027ve got to love Chris Matthews. Over the last two weeks, he’s been relentless in bringing home to his audience again and again and again the political alchemy of turning crap into gold via a deadly game of neocon telephone tag. Cheney to Libby to Chalabi to Miller back to Libby for confirmation by “a senior administration official” (or is it “former Hill staffer”?)… then right to the front pages of the Times, which Cheney and Rice and Powell and Meyers and Rummy can wave around as “proof”. A simple, eye-opening narrative that exemplifies the way the war was sold.READ POST | comments (28)11.02.2005 Ari EmanuelI feel like Pacino in Godfather III: I keep trying to distance myself from any connection to this president… But just when I think I’m out, they pull me back in!READ POST | comments11.02.2005 Gary HartThe religious right in America, empowered by compliant elected officials, some of whom are intimidated by that element, is seeking a dictatorship of the minority.READ POST | comments (26)11.02.2005 RJ EskowDemocrats, bereft of a message and unwilling to state plain truths about war, diplomacy, and the economy, are providing a vacuum which some smart conservative politician will be happy to fill.READ POST | comments (14)11.02.2005 Stephen ElliottI did this profile of Harry Reid for The Progressive when Harry Reid was first appointed Senate Minority Leader.READ POST | comments11.02.2005 Paul RieckhoffHistory should serve as a backdrop to make sure the noblest and most awesome duty of the Senate, the declaration and authorization for war, is carried out in the most responsible manner.READ POST | comments (38)11.02.2005 Harry ShearerCoverage of Rosa Parks\u0027 funeral, second-day reaction to the Alito nomination--what else will drown out the story of the Senate Homeland Security Committe hearing today?READ POST | comments (27)11.02.2005 Deepak ChopraNot enough attention is being paid to a new U.N. report which indicates that wars have declined around the world by 40% since 1992.READ POST | comments (17)11.02.2005 David WallechinskyOne day, Bush will have to hold another press conference and actually face questions about his own awareness of the decision to publicly expose the name of a CIA agent with covert status.READ POST | comments (28)11.02.2005 James K. GalbraithWhen Reid stands up and demands that the Senate keep its promise, that\u0027s \"Partisan Quarrel Forces Senators to Bar the Doors.\"READ POST | comments (43)11.02.2005 Jane HamsherRove\u0027s flunky sashays into his office and Rove doesn\u0027t tell him he\u0027s just engaged in criminal activity, therefore he didn\u0027t. This is the rock upon which Rove will build his defense. I can see it now.READ POST | comments (51)11.02.2005 Laurie DavidWe\u0027ve all seen what Oprah can do for book sales -- now we\u0027re about to find out what she can do for light bulbs.READ POST | comments (48)11.01.2005 Kenneth LererI have been waiting for this day for 5 years. Finally, the Democrats have found their voice, led by Harry Reid, of all people. Finally, they have said \"Enough.\"READ POST | comments (68)11.01.2005 Rep. Diane WatsonThe abuses of power by the White House and Republican congressional leadership are the result of iron-fisted Republican dominance of the legislative and executive branches, the party\u0027s bubble view of the world, and arrogance.READ POST | comments (30)11.01.2005 Michelle PileckiThere was a lot of \"countervailing evidence\" before the invasion, and the media ducked their responsibility to examine it.READ POST | comments (19)11.01.2005 Jamal SimmonsRepublicans in Congress are refusing to keep their commitment to investigate how national intelligence was used to set the stage for war. The Democrats called them on the carpet today.READ POST | comments (40)11.01.2005 David SirotaThe uranium lie was only the most famous in a series of huge lies that scared America into supporting a misguided war.
