{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn many American schools the holiday celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday is used as an opportunity to teach children about his life and legacy. But in too many of those same schools, black and other nonwhite and poor children’s extraordinary talents are still being wasted today. Nearly three-quarters of black and Latino fourth and eighth grade public school students cannot read or compute at grade level. Long after legal segregation has ended black students are still most likely to be excluded from the classroom: black students made up only 18 percent of students in public schools in 2009-2010 but were 40 percent of students who received one or more out-of-school suspensions. When black students are so often left behind and pushed out it should not surprise us that black students are more than twice as likely to drop out of school as white students; each school day 763 black high school students drop out.Comments (51)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Forget broken bones in doctor\u0027s offices and suitcases at the airport. Artist Nick Veasey turns his x-ray machine on the whole world, and these pictures will make you see it in an entirely new way.CommentsMerton BernsteinColes Professor of Law Emeritus, Washington UniversityPresident Obama\u0027s proposal that Congress authorize \"outside government\" public advocates is doubly useless: (1) Congress legislates almost nothing; and (2) such advocates would be too slow and limited to provide balance between intelligence needs and constitutional protections. The FISA Court can provide the rules.Comments (11)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCongratulations. Elvis didn\u0027t make it this far. Here is a random list of personal thoughts in the measure and meaning of a half century on the planet.CommentsDirk HughesCollege registrar in Western MichiganMy story is not unique. It may be surprising, but it is not unique. I have a doctorate. I have been employed full-time for 35 years with only a week or so between jobs. I have worked my butt off my entire adult life. I do not have a drinking or gambling problem. And I still live paycheck to paycheck.Comments (710)Laura CarrollNonfiction Author \u0026 Communications ConsultantIt\u0027s time to stop going round and round with the \"who\u0027s happier\" question when it comes to those with and without kids. It\u0027s not one group versus the other. It boils down to how we define happiness in the first place for ourselves.Comments (21)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027In a meeting I had this week with a congressional candidate, I was reminded of the power of the myths that define conventional wisdom about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the challenge they pose for rational discourse.Comments (11)Kia MakarechiSenior Editor for Mobile and Innovations, The Huffington PostThe thing is, people have actually always been upset about the issues that are enraging them now. The only difference is that the person making the above statement is now interacting with perspectives outside their immediate community and is being exposed to what are almost always longstanding grievances of minority communities.Comments (18)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsInae OhAssociate Editor, HuffPost NYJust because Dunham is a young feminist who speaks confidently about her \"real body\" does not mean we get to qualify her statements with an inappropriate cash prize.Comments (42)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveTo respond to cold-hearted Republican ideology, the 2014 Democratic Agenda must have a strong populist bent. It should begin with the assertion that the economy must work for all the people.Comments (12)AmeliaMother, wife, partner and breadwinnerIf anyone is looking for the wrong thing to say to the parent of a gay child, that\u0027s it, right there.Comments (28)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027As I have followed the reports coming from Central African Republic, I am heartbroken over the suffering of a people the world seems to have forgotten. Since the Seleka, or alliance, rebellion overturned the government in March 2013, there has been widespread insecurity and chaos. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has called the situation a \"mega-crisis.\"CommentsRebecca SmithDeputy Director, National Employment Law ProjectThe recent story of an Indian diplomat in New York arrested for labor abuses garnered national headlines, but the mistreatment suffered by her domestic worker employee barely received a mention.Comments (18)Shelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50After 23 years, do we still love each other, even though we don\u0027t say \"I love you\" as much as we used to? You betcha. Our actions, not our words, tell the story. Being able to count on this man is worth its weight in anniversary chocolates any day of the week.CommentsMJ RosenbergBlogger, Tikkun, Washington SpectatorIf AIPAC is to successfully manipulate U.S. foreign policy on behalf of the Israeli government, it must do so surreptitiously. The night flower thrives in the shade and the media has permitted it to stay there.Comments (32)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageFor years political scientists have wondered why so many working class and poor citizens of so-called \"red\" states vote against their economic self-interest. The usual explanation is that, for these voters, economic issues are trumped by social and cultural issues like guns, abortion, and race. I\u0027m not so sure.Comments (590)Clive DavisRecord producerRather than shrug it off as another expected Streep tour de force, marvel at the ability of this remarkable actress to touch you and affect your emotions like no one else.Comments (11)Geoffrey DunnAuthor, \u0027The Lies of Sarah Palin\u0027Sometimes all you can do is shake your head in disgust at the insipid tendencies of the Christian Science Monitor\u0027s national political coverage.Comments (39)Jack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington PostIronically, it was a scene with no men in it that reminded me how bored I am with movies about men.Comments (50)Gary MayProfessor of History, University of DelawareNearly 50 years after his death it is King\u0027s words and deeds that live on in the American memory -- not that of the racists who hated him or the Black Power advocates who scorned him.CommentsMichael KimmelAuthorWe need to help men reduce the power of that gender policing -- the fear that other men will see us as less than manly if we listen to the voices in our own hearts about how we want to live our lives.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThere will only be more Curtis Reeves cases and more George Zimmerman cases. All because we\u0027ve been conditioned to believe that the law and the Constitution is on the side of the well-armed, heroic shooter, and very seldom on the side of the victim.Comments (844)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911How would you cope if the tax refund you were counting on, and were counting the days until you received, just never showed up? How freaked out would you be if you found that it was sent to another address instead?CommentsSen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen. Dick DurbinProposed laws that would regulate e-cigarettes are met with opposition from those who dismiss e-cigarettes as products that present little or no risk. They claim e-cigarettes are a great way for smokers to quit smoking without exposing innocent bystanders to hazardous vapor. What they don\u0027t tell you is the impact that e-cigarettes are having on people who have never smoked before.Comments (39)Michael RosenblumVideo producer, Founder of Current TVVeasey has taken a very high-tech field, in which he is an expert, radiography, and turned it into an artform in its own right. What makes it so compelling is that through the use of what was designed as a \u0027functional technology\u0027, he alters the way that we see the world.CommentsJoseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorFrom the time he was first elected New Jersey governor in 2010, the corporate media gave mad love to Chris Christie. He was a \"new\" kind of Republican and possibly the next president of the United States. And then: Poof!Comments (74)William AstoreWriter, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceChristie wants authority without personal responsibility. He\u0027s quick to hold others responsible but not himself. He equivocates when he should be unequivocal.Comments (18)Arin GreenwoodEditor, HuffPost DCWhat if our lives get boring without kids? What if we have no one to hang out with once everyone we love has little ones, then bigger ones, to look after? What if one day I\u0027m in the hospital recovering from cancer surgery and I don\u0027t have anyone to make sure the nurses are taking good care of me?Comments (14)Timothy KarrCampaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comTuesday\u0027s court decision stripped the agency of any ability to protect Net Neutrality and stop companies from blocking websites and degrading Internet access. In the few days since a consensus has begun to emerge: To protect the open Internet, the agency must reclassify broadband access as a telecommunications service.CommentsFaisal HoqueEntrepreneur | AuthorI believe our minds have an enormous capacity to connect the invisible dots to guide us to strive for the impossible. This ability to connect the dots comes from mindfully visualizing our path.CommentsJackie K.
