In fact, today\u0027s air strikes against Islamic State forces outside Irbil serves two purposes. First, it protect U.S. interests in a city we cannot afford to lose, lest we see another Benghazi-type situation there. Second it help the Kurds, our best ally in the region, in their efforts to prevent genocide. This kind of action is the right call.

But there are also sleepless nights and mortgages and post baby stretch marks.WriterEvery time the president -- this president or any president -- is allowed to \"cut corners\" on the Constitutional question of Congressional war powers, it sets a bad precedent for the future, eroding a key Constitutional, democratic speed bump against unnecessary wars of choice.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyThe andropausal man and the post-menopausal woman are more alike than any other time in their adult lives.

This means from organic hogs (or hogs raised humanely without hormones or antibiotics).Grilling Authority, www.barbecuebible.comHe cynically fanned racism, manipulated white voters and prepared the ground for the conservative assault on civil rights, affirmative action and social programs that, in the years after his plunge to disgrace, the GOP has honed to a fine art.Author and political analystThere are hundreds of cases in West Africa and now a new cluster of cases in Nigeria is very concerning. The spread of Ebola shows what happens if we don\u0027t have meticulous infection control, contact tracing, and proper isolation of those with symptoms of the disease.Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)I wonder what my 20s would have been like if I had learned to meditate sooner. I wonder if my health would have been different or if I would have been able to handle it all better. Or if maybe all of this was part of a grand order of things. I have room in my life now where I didn\u0027t before.Senior Editor, HuffPost LAThe Obama Administration\u0027s proposed regulation of existing power-sector sources of CO2 has the potential to be cost-effective, and if you accept these numbers, it can also be welfare-enhancing, if not welfare-maximizing.Director of the Harvard Environmental Economics ProgramWe all have a love-hate relationship with the supermarket.
