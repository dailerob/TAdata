{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On Friday, President Obama spent four hours in Afghanistan, assuring the troops that they\u0027re winning the war against the Taliban. Unfortunately, that wasn\u0027t his only disconnect from reality. In a week in which the latest unemployment numbers proved that hopes of a recovery are wishful thinking, in which Congress refused to extend emergency unemployment benefits for 2 million of the long-term unemployed, and in which nearly 27 million Americans are out of work or underemployed, the conversation in Washington is all about the deficit and extending tax cuts for the nation\u0027s wealthiest two percent. And the White House promoted and enabled this disconnect when, months ago, it set up a Deficit Commission instead of a Jobs Commission.
