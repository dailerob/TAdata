{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOViewed as a standalone, the controversy generated by the Clint Eastwood Superbowl commercial is really silly. Yet it points to something profound that has and, if left unaddressed, will continue to undermine America\u0027s ability to regain economic dynamism, create ample jobs, and deal with growing inequalities. It is yet another illustration of the deep political dysfunctionality that continuously undermines DC\u0027s willingness and ability to move forward with the much-needed action.

Miller, 2/10/12Professor of biology, Brown UniversityOur Darwin problem is really a science problem. The easier it becomes to depict the scientific enterprise as a special interest immersed in the culture wars, the easier it becomes to reject scientific findings. We see this everywhere in American culture and politics today.Read Post | Comments (534)Marian Wright Edelman, 2/10/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundLast year more Americans relied on food stamps to eat than at any time since the program began in 1939 -- 46 million.
