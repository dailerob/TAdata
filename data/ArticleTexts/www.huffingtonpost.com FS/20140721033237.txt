And that is unacceptable.Sass \u0026 SensibilityThe nine justices of the SCOTUS are now in recess, leaving the rest of us the summer in which to reflect upon and digest their latest set of rulings. Because it is likely that both judgments will have long-term adverse consequences for progressive causes, a moment of reflection on that second judgment is well in order.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, was constantly doing good for people, whether they were his supporters or not.

I admit I stepped into this search with some trepidation.Founder/CEO, ELLA Institute \u0026 Latinas Think Big™Rob Reiner says his new movie was inspired by Jack Nicholson. When they were talking to the press about their film, The Bucket List, Nicholson was asked what he wanted to be sure he did before he died.Co-founder, GMI Ratings; Movie criticOn July 20, the NAACP will recognize the Day of Unity, to combat the disparate impact that HIV has on Black America.

Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThe notion that Israel and Hamas \"trade\" attacks, or the consistent need for journalists to mention deaths in Gaza alongside \"rockets raining down\" on Israel, mask the reality of the situation on the ground.Features Editor, Islamic HorizonsJust as cell phones are different from ordinary physical objects, the Internet is dramatically different from earlier speech mediums. And the Court should acknowledge those differences in determining the scope of First Amendment protection for speech.Professor of Law at the University of Denver Sturm College of LawHigher education today embodies individualistic, hypercompetitive achievement norms which contribute to inequality in a number of ways.
