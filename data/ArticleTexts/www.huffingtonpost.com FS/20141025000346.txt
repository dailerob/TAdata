{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027If there is ever going to be a solution to the problem of the Islamic State that has a hope of preserving the current geo-political structure of Mesopotamia and the Levant, it rests with the survival of Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime and the resurgence of Syria as a viable national player in the region. Turkey took a leading role in divorcing itself from the Assad regime in 2011, an action which, in many ways, helped precipitate the current Islamic State fiasco. What is needed now is not a continuation of this disastrous policy, but rather a \"Road to Damascus\" conversion on the part of Turkey which re-embraces Bashar al-Assad as the legitimate ruler of Syria, and, in doing so, creates the foundation for the isolation and defeat of the Islamic State in Syria, and later Iraq.Many assume that diplomacy is a ruthless game of hegemony in which one just gives lip service to harmony as a strategy for justifying one\u0027s actions. But what if harmony was actually the goal of diplomacy?Chairman and CEO of the JoongAng Media NetworkEbola-hawking candidates are trying for a bait and switch, but my bet\u0027s on women. Voting for someone who plays on Ebola fears while denying female workers a chance at equal pay is a fool\u0027s game -- and female voters are not fools.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsAmtrak police has not reported a single instance of finding and catching a potential terrorist or serious threat as a result of its suspicious activity reports, yet it is using the same heavy-handed, dragnet approach that we\u0027ve seen in many of the government\u0027s other counter-terrorism and drug trafficking prevention efforts.William J. Brennan Fellow, ACLU\u0027s Speech, Privacy, and Technology ProjectToo bad the term \"socialism\" was appropriated by Karl Marx, because it would be an apt description of today\u0027s emerging social economy. The social media revolution is transforming the way we create wealth, work, learn, play, raise our children, and probably even the way we think.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027It\u0027s impossible not to admire the protestors, who took over much of a central city district.

They represent the time and energy I have claimed and now use to focus on my goal and dreams instead of ever-thinner thighs.Author, actress, fairytale dreamer. Her debut memoir will help those with eating disorders attain happiness and freedom.Jokowi should take advantage of the current surge of optimism and popularity to push through difficult policies quickly, taking advantage of urban Indonesians\u0027 obsession with social media to take the debate out of the bubble blown by Jakarta\u0027s political elite.Author, Indonesia Etc.: Exploring the Improbable NationSchool officials defend their quick resort to call in the school or city police with the claim that black students do commit more serious offenses than other students. There\u0027s nothing to support this.Author and political analystWord seeped out that The Donald was hesitating. Did he not want to pay? Could he not pay?Contributing editor, Vanity FairFinding time for intimacy with kids around can be hard. By the time they go to bed at night, it\u0027s a miracle if you have enough energy to make it to the living room couch without collapsing.Author, blogger at MommyAtoZBlog.comMany take our freedom of speech for granted, especially in a noisy election season, or when the Supreme Court denigrates its importance through decisions like Citizens United. But for too many victims, the freedom to speak up about the nightmare of domestic violence is still a dream.Candidate for CA State Senate SD-26While gun violence can happen anywhere, as Ottawa shows, it happens much more in the United States than any other developed country. Why the discrepancy? The full answer is complicated, but one of the driving factors is not.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI\u0027d heard about -- and desperately wanted to try -- programs that let visitors take shelter dogs out hiking. It was a beautiful fall day, perfect for going for a hike. So my friend and I -- and my dog Murray -- stopped by a local animal shelter to pick up a dog to join us.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostWith Prop 46, California voters can do what the politicians and the status-quo crowd won\u0027t: Nudge our healthcare system toward safer practices, deter doctor substance abuse and hold negligent physicians accountable.President, Brockovich Research \u0026 ConsultingWe have seen everything from historic droughts and extreme wildfires ravaging communities in California, to vanishing wildlife habitat in Alaska, to toxic algae blooming out of control and contaminating drinking water supplies in America\u0027s heartland. How much more do we need to know about the devastating effects of climate change before Congress takes action?U.S. Senator from CaliforniaOn the whole, is American exceptionalism a force for good? The question shouldn\u0027t be hard to answer. To make an exception of yourself is as immoral a proceeding for a nation as it is for an individual.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityAs a female Republican candidate with extreme, far right-wing views and a love for guns, Iowa\u0027s U.S. Senate hopeful Joni Ernst is a lot like Sarah Palin or Michele Bachmann.Activist and political blogger at LatestOutrage.orgLegislators need to pass a law that will provide a guide for colleges and universities and require them to share information with each other and with law enforcement about campus sexual assaults. The detection of a pattern requires sufficient data and someone looking at that data. Right now we have neither.College student defense lawyer representing students in universities and court, criminal defense counsel, former prosecutor \u0026 writerAfter twenty-two days, on July 18th, Kolia was discharged from the hospital, certified Ebola free. He had survived!International medical and public health expert; Senior Advisor to Liberia’s Ebola Response; Senior Advisor to the Division of Global Psychiatry at Massachusetts General HospitalBen Bradlee was undoubtedly the best newsroom leader I ever worked for. He pushed you to be better, spotted the weak spots in your draft and had a nose for news. But I also learned it was not smart to get on his bad side.Joel Dreyfuss lives in ParisFlying can be tense, and shrinking seat sizes don\u0027t help. In fact, research suggests that crowded flights can lead to a breakdown of normal social functioning among passengers. But flying doesn\u0027t need to bring out the worst in you.U.S. News \u0026 World Report TravelThe VA\u0027s shortage of therapists and difficulty reaching rural veterans means even those diagnosed may not get all the help they need. But even those who were diagnosed and treated find that at some point, therapy has done all it can do. More sessions won\u0027t necessarily help. From that point on, veterans say, their lives become a matter of coping.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostAs a first-time mom, I\u0027ve come to this simple realization: If you are worried that you\u0027re not a good parent, trust me, that makes you an amazing parent. It\u0027s the parents who don\u0027t worry that we should be worried about.A Mobile Community for ParentsRather than viewing the conflict merely between Jews and Arabs, it is important to note that the major disagreement here is between Palestinians and Israelis who support the separation of the area into two states and those Arabs and Israelis who reject the partition of Palestine in favor of a one-state solution.Professor of Political Science, UCLAWhen I have an opportunity to mentor someone, I find the most important thing is to listen to them when they tell you about themselves. That will always give you an idea of what type of support they need.Seven-time NBA All StarIf Republicans take the Senate next month (and if he wins his own reelection race), Mitch McConnell will be that body\u0027s next Majority Leader.
