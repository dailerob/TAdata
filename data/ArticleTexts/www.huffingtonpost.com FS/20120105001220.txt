{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterPresident Obama announced today that he will use his constitutional authority under the Recess Appointments Clause to push through vital political appointments. Partisans on each side in this matter will surely accuse the other of playing partisan dirty tricks. Senate Republicans have already accused the president of a power grab because, they claim, the pro-forma session means that the Senate is not technically in recess. The president\u0027s supporters will counter by saying that Republican Senators are using the trick of pro-forma sessions to strip the president of the recess appointment authority specifically provided to him by the Constitution. But if we consider legal precedents, it\u0027s likely that after all this partisan squabbling ends, the president may have the Chief Justice on his side.Read Post | CommentsRichard Cordray, 01/ 4/12Director of the Consumer Financial Protection BureauToday, I was appointed by President Obama to serve as the first Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Luis Gutierrez, 01/ 4/12Congressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoI am proud to live in a country where the rule of law and federal immigration preeminence enshrined in the constitution are tools to undo what legislatures in Alabama, South Carolina, and elsewhere have tried to do when politicizing and polarizing the immigration issue.Read Post | Comments (19)Franchesca Ramsey, 01/ 4/12Comedian, Graphic Designer, Natural Hair Lover and Video BloggerOver the years I\u0027ve found that dealing with racial people faux pas can be tricky.

Yet among self-identified Republicans, the totals were actually 28-27-14, showing that Santorum and Romney lead the base, while independents and new voters propelled Paul.Read Post | Comments (149)Evan Shapiro, 01/ 4/12President, IFCFor more than half a century, TV Hipsters have had a profound effect on American culture. These characters taught many of us the importance of oddball tastes, wardrobe thrifting and (perhaps more importantly) the ever-lasting power of snark.Read Post | Comments (65)Joe Peyronnin, 01/ 4/12NYU Journalism ProfessorIt is unclear whether conservative Santorum\u0027s strong showing in Iowa will be enough to propel him into the lead.
