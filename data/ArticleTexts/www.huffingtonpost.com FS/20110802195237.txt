{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupIf you haven\u0027t noticed, this is Mitch McConnell\u0027s moment. And if you haven\u0027t realized it, this won\u0027t be the last. In fact, there will be many more, especially if -- as is quite possible -- he becomes Republican majority leader of the Senate after next year\u0027s elections. In what amounted to a victory speech as the final vote approached on the debt ceiling he brokered, the senior senator from Kentucky reached what has been a career-long goal: to be this century\u0027s Henry Clay. Only instead of being Kentucky\u0027s \"Great Compromiser,\" McConnell is and wants to be the Bluegrass\u0027s \"Great Dismantler.\"Read Post | CommentsSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 8/2/11U.S. Senator from New YorkIt is unfortunate that Congress missed an opportunity today to seriously take on debt reduction with a balanced approach. I have not been in Washington long, but long enough to know it is broken.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 8/2/11Editor, Eat the PressCome one, come all, and celebrate the debt ceiling deal! Sure, we\u0027ve no way of knowing if steep spending cuts will imperil the government\u0027s ability to regulate the sale of poisonous toys from China, but that\u0027s not journalism\u0027s job to worry about.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 8/2/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027What precisely will Obama fight for now that the debt deal has tied his hands? He says he wants to extend tax cuts for middle class families and make sure the jobless get unemployment benefits. Fine, but the new deal won\u0027t let him.Read Post | CommentsLinda Bergthold, 8/2/11Health policy consultantNow that the debt ceiling will be raised and we can pay our bills (for a while at least), we are left to wonder -- what will it really mean for some of the programs we care about?Read Post | CommentsAnneli Rufus, 8/2/11Comfort-food freakAre Trader Joe\u0027s frozen gnocchi and Hibachi House frozen teriyaki chicken destroying Western civilization? Or are they the great liberators of our age?Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 8/2/11Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesThe American economy is an economy in serious need of help, and the debt deal doesn\u0027t help. That is, unless in clears the decks for some actual policy-making to give this economy a nudge forward before it topples over.Read Post | CommentsPaul Tullis, 8/2/11Writer on policy, politics, science and cultureThis battle over the debt deal was not a matter of who believes in Keynes. It was a matter of Republicans caring more about power than about governing, and Democrats being unable to wrest that power from Republicans so that they can govern.Read Post | CommentsJanuary Jones, 8/2/11ActressIf even just a fraction of all Shark Week viewers took action to protect sharks, it would equal millions of people speaking up for the ocean\u0027s top predators. We shouldn\u0027t be scared of sharks, we should be scared for them.Read Post | CommentsBill George, 8/2/11Professor of management practice at Harvard Business SchoolThis week\u0027s agreement to increase the U.S. debt ceiling is no cause for celebration. The political landscape is covered with the blood of all the politicians who were losers in this \"no win\" battle.Read Post | CommentsRobert Guttman, 8/2/11Director, Center on Politics and Foreign Relations (CPFR), Johns Hopkins UniversityAfter criticizing in detail the federal government and arguing that his goal is to save the people from the Supreme Court, one wonders why in the world the governor would want to move to the nation\u0027s capital if it is so terrible.Read Post | CommentsLarry Magid, 8/2/11Technology journalistI used to think I could manage my own often-interrupted life by \"multitasking.\" But except for things like walking and chewing gum, multitasking is a myth. When it comes to cognitive tasks, our brains aren\u0027t really capable of competently doing more than one thing at a time.Read Post | CommentsMark Penn, 8/2/11CEO, Burson-MarstellerThe 11th hour budget deal may save the country from default but is unlikely to save either the president or the Republicans from continued political fallout for taking the country near the brink of financial calamity.Read Post | CommentsCaitlin Storhaug, 8/2/11Marketing and media executiveNo matter how good I was at my job, I\u0027m sure I wasn\u0027t the barrier between Herman and the bluster he\u0027s filling airwaves with now. Something changed and he decided that crazy and fearful is the way to win.Read Post | CommentsEmily Faherty, 8/2/11Associate Editor, AOL City’s BestI\u0027ve been thinking a lot about the \"c-word\" recently. The thing that took the life of a good family friend just last week. The disease that kills 1,500 Americans every day. And the reason I\u0027m running the NYC Marathon this year.Read Post | CommentsWilliam Hartung, 8/2/11Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyThe good news is that the Pentagon budget is finally on the table in deficit reduction talks. But it will take a lot more hard work to ensure that it is truly reduced as part of ongoing negotiations over the size and shape of the federal budget.Read Post | CommentsKathryn Minshew, 8/1/11CEO and Co-Founder, The Daily MuseThe world is changing, and the women\u0027s movement is changing with it. As a culture, we\u0027ve left behind the antagonistic, us-versus-them mentality of the 70s and 80s, but we\u0027ve found the modern refrain that \"men and women should be indistinct in the workplace\" rings hollow, too.Read Post | CommentsKristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D., 8/2/11Dietitian and wellness manager, The Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute and the Cleveland Clinic Lifestyle 180 programThe United States is getting bigger and we have the data to prove it. Since 1985, in just 25 years, our nation has grown fatter at an alarming rate!Read Post | CommentsRep. Luis Gutierrez, 8/2/11Congressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoI am a strong supporter of President Obama. But the deportation policies Senator Obama once described as \"terrorizing communities\" have not changed significantly. I cannot sit quietly and wait.Read Post | CommentsMandy Moore, 8/2/11Singer-songwriter, actress and PSI AmbassadorMalaria is responsible for over 40% of deaths in health care facilities across Cameroon. This means that thousands of children -- as well as adults -- in this West African country die each year from an easily preventable disease.Read Post | CommentsJonathan Richards, 8/2/11CartoonistRead Post | CommentsCarey Perloff, 8/2/11Artistic Director, American Conservatory TheaterIn a desperate attempt to feel relevant in an increasingly digital universe, the regional theater has all but abandoned its alternative stance and now actively pursues commercial success and a presence in New York.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 8/1/11Author, commentator and contributing editor, TheLoop21.comMany of our elected officials know a lot less about finance and economics than those responsible for the financial future of an entire country should. Even more terrifying, many appear to know even less about such matters than we do.Read Post | CommentsNathan Newman, 8/2/11Founder, Tech-Progress.orgIs there viable competition anywhere to Google? Let\u0027s forget about the poor Microsoft shareholders and ask what the fact that Bing only exists due to massive subsidies says about the health of competition in search.Read Post | CommentsFrances Beinecke, 8/2/11President, Natural Resources Defense CouncilInstead of subsidizing industries that anchor us in the past, we should be investing in the kinds of clean energy solutions that prepare us for the future.Read Post | CommentsMarcus Samuelsson, 8/2/11Follow me on Twitter @MarcusCooksIt\u0027s often hard for us to imagine going without some of our luxuries like travel, dining out, or Internet, much less our basic necessities like food and water. But try for a minute to imagine how life would be with such deprivations.Read Post | CommentsJa\u0027el Gordon, 2011.08.03Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, 2011.08.02Michael Brune, 2011.08.02J.
