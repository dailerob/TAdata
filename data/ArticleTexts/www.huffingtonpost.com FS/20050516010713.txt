{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaSunday is traditionally a day to kick back and take a breath. To leisurely read the paper, take a walk, dawdle over your laptop at Starbucks. To reflect on the week past before diving into the week ahead. So it is here at the HuffPost -- and what a seven days it’s been! So before we dive into our second week of delivering news and opinion, our Featured Post section offers a second look at some of our most memorable posts from Week One. Of course, we also have fresh takes on The Blog and the latest news headlines from around the world. Enjoy.05.13.2005 Larry DavidI know this may not sound politically correct, but as someone who has abused and tormented employees and underlings for years, I am dismayed by all of this yammering directed at John Bolton.read whole post | permalink05.13.2005 Dennis PragerI see in this student who screams obscenities at a conservative speaker and all the students who joined or supported him, our version of the Hitler Youth, our barbarians.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 Mike McCurryFour million children die each year around the world within one week of being born. Three million of them could be saved if they had proper sanitation, clean water, nutrition. Simple things.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 David ReesI stopped by the Carnegie Council this morning and asked if Larry David was ready to read my screenplay--AS I HAD BEEN PROMISED.Guess what Arianna? You were mistaken: Larry David doesn’t work at the Carnegie Council.So my screenplay remains unread. (It’s called \"Heritage Foundation’s Ultimate Energy Policy Adventure\": Think \"Revenge of the Nerds\" meets \"a bunch of bullshit underwritten by ExxonMobil.\")An unread screenplay? For this I agreed to blog?read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 Danielle CrittendenAdmit it. Hollywood misses those halcyon days of the Clinton administration, when the Lincoln bedroom functioned as a luxury hotel suite for crusading celebrities.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 Paul RieckhoffRegardless of how you feel about the war, we have a moral obligation to take care of the people who fought in it. And right now, America is simply not doing enough.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 Ellen DeGeneresLate last year, Congress did away with a 34 year old regulation banning the government from selling any of the 37,000 wild horses running free across America’s western plains. Since the new rule was adopted, the Bureau of Land Management has sold over a thousand horses to private parties. At least 41 of them have been slaughtered and turned into dog food.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 Michael IsikoffHerewith an offbeat -- but entirely true -- offering from some recent discoveries from the Nixon tapes.author bio | permalink05.13.2005 John CusackWent to Hunter S. Thompson’s memorial service in Aspen. The next day, we went to Owl Farm -- which remained untouched since Hunter’s death two weeks before. The sun was shining and gunfire echoed as friends and family gathered and shot targets on the lawn. Norman Greenbaum’s “Spirit in the Sky” booming. Books, notes, numbers, pills, bullets, totems and talismans everywhere. Outside his wife offered liquid acid to people in the driveway. In the kitchen where he took his life, a huge American flag overlooked his suicide. He was looking right at it.read whole post | permalink05.13.2005 Robert EvansHave you ever been involved in a ménage a trois? Well, while putting together an expose of the porn biz for Sirius Satellite Radio, I found myself smack in the center of an experience that’s thought of as strictly taboo… And where did this clandestine rendezvous take place? Well, I hate to say it, but right here in the bed of the notorious Robert Evans -- that’s me, pal.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 Arianna HuffingtonIn touting their proposal (which, by the way, isn’t really theirs [pdf]), Gingrich said e-health care info systems would eliminate medical mistakes caused by illegible prescription orders. “Paper kills,” he warned ominously. I can hear the TV ad now: “Making the world safe from bad handwriting!”read whole post | permalink05.13.2005 Greg GutfeldUpdate on Party sightings, Delhi - India. May 12, 2005: Things are still going nuts at Alaknanda Jayagopal\u0027s house. Aparjita and Agilah broke into the liquor cabinet, and Gaurika, Fulmala, Heenfu and Indrani started a dance party in the garage. Totally off the hook.read whole post | author bio | permalink read all of The Gutfeld Drive-Bys05.13.2005 Quincy JonesThat new Elvis movie got me to thinking about fame and massive success and about how some people can handle it -- and how for others it can be the most destructive thing in the world. It got me to thinking about Michael -- and how difficult it is to watch what’s going on with him now.read whole post | permalink05.13.2005 Joe ScarboroughAmnesty International was so concerned about the two million Sudanese victims that they did, well, nothing.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 Jim LampleyByron York has treated me fairly and without rancor, and I\u0027m honored that he saw fit to engage me in this little set-to we\u0027ve conducted since Monday. I fired a lead right, Rep. John Conyers shouted encouragement from my corner, then York delivered a hook to the body.

Now, when I come home to my wife, I feel nothing. How could I? SHE COULD BE A MAN. Thanks a lot, gays.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 Rep. John ConyersWhat I found in Ohio was a series of massive irregularities, many of which were illegal under federal and/or state law, and every single one resulted in a loss of votes for John Kerry, not George Bush. I wonder why?read whole post | author bio | permalink05.14.2005 Harry ShearerLittle things can have big consequences. Is it coincidence that in the era when it was forbidden at CBS News to describe their output as \"shows\" (they had to be referred to as \"broadcasts\") one never saw news footage slo-mo\u0027d or accompanied by mood music? Tell it to Art Bell.Dateline-lying is another such small change that has larger meaning.People have been fired from major newspapers for putting datelines on stories when they were nowhere near the place the story occurred--or, at best, when they flew in just to plant their feet on the newsy soil for the purpose of claiming the dateline. Yet, in TV and radio news, dateline-lying is becoming more and more common.Every time you hear a report end with \"....Jim Schmeman, NBC News\" as opposed to the name of the place where the event occurs, you\u0027re hearing a subtle form of the nefarious act. The \"reporter\" is actually a narrator, sitting in an audio booth hundreds, or thousands, of miles away from the story, reading copy over sound or film gathered by some other orgtanization. \"Bill Melater, npr news\" is a subtle way of suggesting that Bill\u0027s there.
