{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressSo what, in the end, did Schock do wrong? Simply put, he failed to be corrupt in a way that could supersede the media\u0027s default position, in which \"good government\" types are taken less seriously than the veteran government hacks and crooks who succeed within a broken system, forever spinning through well-greased revolving doors, selling out and falling upward. Schock got laid low because, ultimately, he lacked ambition -- he was scrabbling after nickel-and-dime benefits instead of setting his sights on a bigger payout. He was, compared to those who\u0027ve mastered the art of institutional corruption, a joke. But -- ha, ha! -- really, the joke\u0027s on you.Let me be free. Let me be me! Don\u0027t make me old, with your thinking and words about how I should be. You don\u0027t have to come to my shows. I am giving tremendous energy with my voice, because that is me. Get my energy or shut up.ArtistThe essential precursor to any solution -- a will to recognize the equal rights of non-Jews in any of the five states that Israel controls -- is absent. Whether that refusal is best represented by a Bibi who says no concessions or a Buji whose idea of an ideal world is that Israel keeps all of the land it has occupied, I leave that for others to judge.Editor, Middle East EyeHow does the brain change as we age, and what steps can we take to help our brains stay healthy as time goes by?

His daughter had asked my daughter to tell me the news.Professor Emerita, Women and Gender Studies at U.C. DavisSTOCKHOLM - A breakthrough might compel a phase of intense diplomacy, giving Iran a pathway to diplomatic normalization and opening the door for grand bargains that could begin to restore order and stability to the rest of the region. A breakdown, by contrast, though unlikely to lead immediately to war, could easily foment developments that lead in that direction, and the region as a whole could be pulled even deeper into the current vortex of chaos and violence.Sweden’s foreign minister from 2006 to October 2014, and was Prime Minister from 1991 to 1994Should the next government end up being led by Netanyahu, every Israeli will live to mourn the demise of Israel as a democratic and Jewish state and the home of brave pioneers who made a millennium-long dream a reality.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe reason I am against the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is not because I am a lefty liberal, but because I am a proud American Christian.

This state is beginning the slippery slope of legalized discrimination.Husband, daddy, and pastor at Emerson Ave. Baptist on the east side of Indy.

It should not be forgotten that the Six Party Talks\u0027 remit was wider than the nuclear issue alone, though this never came to fruition.Chairman and CEO of the JoongAng Media NetworkAmong Nintendo\u0027s \"diverse and interesting female protagonists\" are a pink version of a toadstool and a pink version of a bomb, called Toadette and Bombette.Editor, Huffington Post TechAnyone who didn\u0027t see the homophobia at CPAC -- and the organizing around it that still animates much of the conservative movement, and is bowed to by the GOP -- must have been wearing blinders.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesBy strengthening the safety net and investing in 21st-century infrastructure, manufacturing, education, and environmental protection, the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u0027 \"People\u0027s Budget\" will create 8.4 million new jobs and give low- and moderate-income Americans a much-needed raise.

The answer to this is startling: it didn\u0027t have much electoral impact because it was almost totally absent from the discourse of the supposedly left former Labor Party which now calls itself \"The Zionist Union.\"Editor, Tikkun MagazineOne way for Aetna to satisfy Wall Street was to begin shifting more and more of the cost of health care -- and health insurance -- to their customers. That meant that sick policyholders in particular would be paying more out of their own pocket for their care. Our marketing folks came up with an almost Orwellian name for this cost shifting: \"consumer-driven health care.\"Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThe Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C., is using the Freedom of Information Act to unearth a \"culture of animus\" that permeated the U.S. Civil Service Commission -- now known as the Office of Personnel Management -- and demonstrate that anti-equality laws and regulations have long been grounded in hostility, which is not a permissible justification for discrimination.Senior Fellow, People for the American WayWhen it comes to drug overdose, we may be winning one battle, but losing the war. As deaths involving prescription painkillers are leveling off, the latest stats on heroin fatalities could not be more dire. What\u0027s often lost behind the headlines is that the trends in prescription painkiller and heroin abuse are linked.Assistant Professor of Law and Health Sciences, Northeastern UniversityPeople whose greatest fears in life include transgender people in bathrooms will increasingly be seen for what they are, and the rest of us will be able to just get on with our lives.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandPlease know that both legally and ethically, there are times when I want to say something or agree with you but cannot for a multitude of reasons, usually pertaining to the privacy of another student.

I hope that some of them are helpful.Vice President for Communications, Oberlin CollegeIn his latest op-ed, McConnell repeated the same baseless claims he has been making for some time.

And he contended it would ruin his state\u0027s economy, throwing \"countless\" people out of work.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsGoldsmith\u0027s writing and performance of \"The Body of Michael Brown\" is problematic, not because he does not have the \"right\" to use the text, but because his use of it is fundamentally false.Author, \u0027Reconstructing Mayakovsky\u0027 and \u0027Queerskins\u0027While I\u0027m mustering the bravery to proudly and persistently proclaim that black lives matter, a band of white guys from Portland are running around calling themselves \"Black Pussy\" with no consideration for how that registers in the mind of a black girl who has actually been reduced to that by a stranger.Vocalist and drummer of Music BonesImagine this: you\u0027re in the throes of labor pain and contractions, and you arrive at your nearest hospital to give birth. When you arrive, the hospital is dirty and the bed sheets haven\u0027t been washed.Chief Executive, WaterAid AmericaIf you are an employee, you know that staying healthy benefits you in many ways: fewer missed work days, greater productivity and less stress.
