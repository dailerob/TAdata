{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Vice President for Defense and Foreign Policy Studies, Cato Institute.There were a few moments during the most recent Democratic debate when Bernie Sanders let fly his frustration with the bipartisan consensus that drives U.S. foreign policy. \"The United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world,\" the senator from Vermont explained. Judging from the audience reaction, there is considerable sympathy for his perspective. We shouldn\u0027t, however, hold our breath that a strategic shift is in the offing. The Saudis, Qataris, and others are unlikely to change course and take responsibility for their security, because they believe that Uncle Sam will keep doing it for them. They know that Bernie Sanders won\u0027t be elected president of the United States. And they have good reason to doubt that any other serious critics of U.S. foreign policy will be either.This year, contributors to The Huffington Post published thousands of blogs, offering their perspectives on topics ranging from LGBT rights to gun violence to body image.

There just isn\u0027t any downside to attacking this imaginary monster of groupthink, so we can expect to hear speakers trumpeting their own courage in \"not being pc\" as they attack especially vulnerable groups in society.President, Wesleyan UniversityAt a time when America is experiencing an upsurge of progressive organizing and activism -- from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter to Bernie Sanders\u0027 campaign for president -- we need a regular columnist who can explain what\u0027s going on, why its happening, and what it means.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeIf only the people who engage in \"road rage\" would engage in \"corporate rage\" when they are harmed by cover-ups or hazardous products and gouging services, aloof CEOs would start getting serious about safety and fair play.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorApparently, The Force Awakens can only be regarded as a great or appalling film, and nothing else. Here are 10 reasons why irate critiques of The Force Awakens miss their mark.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingWell we did it. Made it through another year. When it comes to women, we\u0027ve had some good news, and some bad news, with a little weird news thrown in.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsPerhaps the most painful disagreement between the two countries has been over the “comfort women” issue. An agreement this week may finally put the matter to rest. But not everyone in the Korean community is happy with the deal.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogHONG KONG -- The Paris agreement was a step forward. Now, coordinated and sensible action is required. To do that, we need to challenge the myths around how to deal with climate change.Founder and CEO of the Global Institute For TomorrowOne of the most critical questions will be whether the prosecutors can present evidence relating to the many other accusations made against Cosby by other women. The judge\u0027s ruling on this issue may end up being the turning point in the case.Criminal defense attorney in Portland, OregonI know anxiety has always been something I live with, but sitting in my doctor\u0027s office that day was the first time I saw it on a piece of paper.

Here\u0027s a countdown of my top ten for 2015.Media Scholar and Critic, zakiscorner.comWe can argue about politics, the economy, religion and anything else we can think of, but there should be no argument when it comes to human lives in peril.PhotographerThe WorldPost commissioned countless blogs this year from our contributors around the world. Their big-picture analysis, context and insight illuminated the \"how,\" \"why\" and \"what next\" of the globe\u0027s most pressing news events. Often writing about countries where they live or are from, our contributors made us think differently about world affairs by opening our eyes to new perspectives. Here are a few of their pieces from 2015 that you won\u0027t want to miss.While Iran has swiftly moved to comply with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the multilateral nuclear accord struck in July, hardliners in both Iran and the U.S. have already succeeded in provoking actions that threaten to poison the atmosphere for the deal\u0027s implementation.Policy Fellow, National Iranian American CouncilWords don\u0027t come easy, especially when you know Lemmy would have laughed at us all trying to say dignified things about him being a hero. Any time I attempted to say anything complimentary to Lemmy to his face, he would fix me with a kind of amused, contemptuous stare. But a kind of hero he certainly was.Founding member of Queen, Doctor of Astrophysics and animal rights campaignerI guess nurses are a secretive bunch. But if it\u0027s right what they say, that the truth will set you free, then here are 10 secrets your nurse has been keeping from you.Brie is a part-time nurse and full-time mom. When she\u0027s not chasing children, doting on her husband, or trying to catch up on laundry she enjoys writing.Tarantino\u0027s films can only really be compared to each other, and the Hateful Eight serves as an excellent progress report for how Tarantino has and hasn\u0027t evolved as a filmmaker.Gentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink ReviewsDigital devices and services are extremely complex, interconnected systems. Devising an additional layer of complexity at scale to permit government access will create new vulnerabilities and exacerbate existing ones.President and CEO, Computer and Communications Industry AssociationI believe that wearing a gun in a public venue does nothing to promote public safety. And the merchants who have opted out of open carry evidently agree, with most citing concerns about guns endangering rather than protecting their customers, particularly in places where alcohol is served.Mike the Gun GuyThe best intentions can\u0027t really stop these guys, but adopting a best-practices approach to data security can make your online world more secure. Here are some of the things you can do in 2016 to help avoid the living hell of identity theft and other identity-related crimes.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911I\u0027ve been noticing that Democrats -- all the way up to and including Hillary Clinton herself -- seem to be awfully complacent about the possible outcomes of next year\u0027s presidential race. This could be dangerous, because nothing in politics is ever written in stone.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThese genius inventions are sending us careening into a world of abundance, bold visionaries and accelerating exponential change.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZECulture at large is nothing but machismo in disguise. It is a series of values and ideas imposed from a male perspective, which are considered to be universal truths in every social context.Forensic physician and professor at the University of GranadaThe Trinity matters because it creates an early opportunity to seize momentum, demonstrate viability and garner media attention.Presidential Professor \u0026 Chair of Political Science at the University of OklahomaProfessor and Fellow, Department of Communication and Public Policy Research Institute, Texas A\u0026M UniversityWanting to accelerate low-carbon development and getting it done are two different things -- and the biggest challenge for the climate movement is to dramatically speed up successful implementation of the Paris commitments made by almost 200 nations.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubI am disappointed in my state.

Our state may quite literally start the new year by taking yet another step backwards.Digital Marketer in Charleston, SCWhile politicians like Trump and Rubio are often quick to demonize all Muslims and blame them for acts of terror, little to no effort is given to really understand the root causes and motivations for such terrorism. With such a mentality, it is impossible to pursue a truly effective counterterrorism policy.Head of Foreign Relations Committee of Iran’s National Security Council (1997-2005)I chose you at 14 when I met you. I chose you at 25 when I married you. I choose you over and over again.

Author of The Best Day of Your Life and The Art of Parenting.If the GOP front-runners have such a cartoonish view of an ally with whom we share a border and cling to a world that ceased to exist over a generation ago, how can we trust them to manage our affairs on a global level? The answer is simple, we cannot.Host, Cyber Law and Business Report; political columnist; internet lawyerJust a few decades ago, almost anyone who fled the manifest dangers and oppressions of the Soviet Union, Vietnam, China or Cuba could reasonably expect to find safe haven in the \"free world.\"Author and editor, New America MediaGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
