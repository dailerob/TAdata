{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Texas Governor Rick Perry blustered his way into the thick of the GOP presidential race, racking up national exposure and controversial statements with equal swiftness. He referred to evolution as \"a theory that is out there\"; knocked Social Security as little more than a \"Ponzi Scheme\"; and derided worries about climate change, saying climates have \"been changing ever since the earth was formed\" (when pressed on when, exactly, that occurred, he would only say that the planet is \"pretty old\"). But the Perry quote of the week had to be his warning that should Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke come down to the governor\u0027s home state, Texans \"would treat him pretty ugly.\" Pretty old, pretty ugly... pretty scary. And on the pretty geeky side of the news ledger, it was announced that \"retweet\" and \"sexting\" have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary. No word on whether @RepWeiner feels validated.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 8/19/11Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupKarl Rove won\u0027t say it aloud, but he is afraid of Rick Perry: afraid that the smack-talking Texas governor will wreck the GOP\u0027s chances of winning the White House and the Senate in 2012.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 8/14/11Award-winning actress, author and activistJust so you know, despite her historic achievements as a feminist icon, as a girlfriend, Gloria Steinem is every bit as real as you and me.Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 8/18/11Professor of Literature at YaleLet us examine Obama by the standard of his cabinet members, advisers, and favored influences.
