{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Ahmed Shihab-EldinEmmy-Nominated Producer/Host, @HuffPostLiveI understand why so many (namely President Obama) are careful not to call this a coup. But whatever we call it, we must acknowledge the basic facts: A president elected in unprecedented free and fair elections was overthrown by an ever-powerful military that took its cues from an unprecedented mobilization of millions of Egyptians challenging his rule. Morsi failed at nearly everything the Egyptian people had hoped and entrusted him to do, chief among them, uniting a divided Egypt. But Egypt\u0027s military has failed for far longer, with a lot more blood on their hands. And no one is more ruthless in suppressing the rights of others in Egypt than the American-made military.Comments (386)Louise LeakeyAssistant Research Professor of Anthropology, University of Stony BrookWhat the fossil record does is force us to contemplate our place on the planet. We are but one species of several hominids that inhabited planet earth and like our distant cousins who went extinct fairly recently, our time on planet earth is also finite.Comments (815)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSelf-sufficiency isn\u0027t something most kids are born with. The school year, with its rigorous after-school sports and activity schedules, doesn\u0027t offer this sort of platform for learning how to be alone, or for knowing how to create their own fun -- a skill that\u0027s not only a good thing but also essential.Comments (58)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt is, of course, difficult to assess the performance of the FISA court, because its activities are secret. But with 30 years of experience, it is possible to offer some reflections and suggestions.Comments (25)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolSo when Mohamed Morsi was elected president of Egypt, or when Hamas and Hezbollah won elections in Gaza and Lebanon, some Committee on Core Beliefs should have had a veto over the outcome? What could possibly go wrong?Comments (52)Victor J. WilliPhD History, Oxford UniversityWhat happened yesterday is phenomenal and unprecedented in Egyptian history. While millions of Egyptians cheered and partied until in the early morning on June 30th, and then again yesterday, following the sacking of Morsi, there is, however, a flip side to the coin.Comments (230)Barry LandoAuthor, \u0027Web of Deceit\u0027Since the fall of Mubarak, the military have feared not just a takeover by radical Muslims. There is also the fact that real civilian rule could spell an end to the system of massive military corruption and patronage that has gone on for decades in Egypt.Comments (125)Arianna HuffingtonMandela\u0027s leadership lessons will belong to the ages, just as Lincoln\u0027s leadership lessons do. Two very different men, but they shared the same defining qualities that we need in the 21st century.Comments (283)Janus AdamsEmmy Award-winning journalist, historian and producerFounding Fathers, you got it together by making a few compromises. How\u0027s it working for you now? The bargaining chips you played then -- slaves, women, Native Americans -- are still being played today.Comments (348)Ekow N. YankahProfessor of Law, Cardozo School of LawOn this Fourth of July, it is the basic realization that rolling up your sleeves and being a part of your political community, rather than grasping at a fuzzy picture of a cowboy alone on a plain, is the true display of virtue.Comments (299)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027What do I love about America? I especially love our best national values: freedom, opportunity, community, justice, human rights, and equality under the law for all of our citizens of every race, creed, culture, and gender, not just for the rich and powerful.Comments (380)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s time to remember these forgotten Americans -- our brothers and sisters, our neighbors, friends and children -- and to take action to help them. In this time of celebrated patriotism, anything less is hypocrisy.Comments (35)Tiffiniy ChengCo-founder, Fight for the FutureWhat the NSA is doing is criminal. It\u0027s immoral. And it goes against everything this country is supposed to be about.Comments (688)Vivian NorrisPh.D. focusing on Globalization and Media StudiesPeople will be talking about Senator Davis\u0027 filibuster for many years to come. Those who have made, and will make the trip to the capitol in Austin to make their voices heard, will become politicized forever. They will not forget the energy and solidarity which we have witnessed.Comments (522)FoodbeastJuly 4 is about eating well, sitting back and enjoying each other\u0027s company.

But what if, hypothetically Snowden was able to sneak past the FSB, Russian police, airport security and get on that plane?Comments (24)Cesar MillanFounder of the Cesar Millan FoundationWhen the fireworks are going off this year, pay attention to how your dogs react, and which of these techniques help the most. Make notes, then plan ahead for next year. July 5th is the best day to start the process of preparing your dog for next year\u0027s festivities.Comments (40)Laura CarrollNonfiction Author and Communications ConsultantWhat if we made our first obligation to the planet and those already here, and that means not just humans, but as conservationist Dave Foreman calls them, \"wild things\" (all other living beings on earth)?Comments (71)Food52food52.comFeel like a kid again this Fourth of July with these homemade berry rocket pops.CommentsMark BosloughPhysicist; Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical InquiryOn this Independence Day, it is worth reflecting on the willingness of our founding fathers to sacrifice their own comforts for the future--for many generations to come, including ours.Comments (134)Leonard SlatkinInternationally acclaimed conductorYes, this piece, celebrating Napoleon\u0027s retreat from Russia, has become the unofficial anthem of our most celebrated celebration. The public would forgo Sousa, John Williams and Gershwin but take away Peter Ilyich and all muskets would break out.Comments (20)TravelzooIndependence Day is around the corner, and with that in mind, here\u0027s a handy list of the big fireworks displays on the Fourth in cities across the U.S. this year.Comments (22)Alex WirthChair, Campaign for a Presidential Youth CouncilEach of these young people is an example of what happens when youth perspectives are brought into government. When young people interact with government they bring innovative ideas, motivation and often a greater spirit of compromise than we currently see among many adult officials.CommentsMartha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsOn this 237th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the daughters of 2013 still don\u0027t have equal constitutional rights with men, though many Americans think otherwise. Nope.Comments (335)Catie ParrishChief Homemaker, Wayfair.comYes, yes, our guests\u0027 comfort and happiness are the top priority. But we also want to wow them. We want to create a setting that\u0027s clever, pretty, and -- dare I say -- pin-worthy. The good news is there are ways to show your creativity without having to take three days off work.CommentsDr. Lee BowesCEO, America Works of New York, Inc.There are over 21 million veterans in the United States today. Over 2.6 million men and women have served our country in uniform since 2001. There are hundreds of thousands of veterans who cannot find jobs, but deserve them. They can do the work. I\u0027ve seen it firsthand.CommentsMario LivioAstrophysicist, Space Telescope Science InstituteWhere did the atoms of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, and iron (all essential for life) come from?
