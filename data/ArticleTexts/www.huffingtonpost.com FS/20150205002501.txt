{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsWhen companies go bankrupt, a debt-equity swap is a fair and efficient solution. The analogous approach for Greece is to convert its current bonds into GDP-linked bonds. If Greece does well, its creditors will receive more of their money; if it does not, they will get less. Both sides would then have a powerful incentive to pursue pro-growth policies. Seldom do democratic elections give as clear a message as that in Greece. If Europe says no to Greek voters\u0027 demand for a change of course, it is saying that democracy is of no importance, at least when it comes to economics. Why not just shut down democracy, as Newfoundland effectively did when it entered into receivership before World War II? One hopes that those who understand the economics of debt and austerity, and who believe in democracy and humane values, will prevail. Whether they will remains to be seen.We\u0027ve barely heard from the other clown-car passengers and already Huckabee has navigated his way through at least three major new cycles in which he says something obnoxious then walks it back, but only after the GOP base scarfs it down like, I don\u0027t know, whatever it eats.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Hopefully Ashton Carter, President Obama\u0027s nominee for Secretary of Defense, will make a strong commitment to closing down Guantanamo before the end of President Obama\u0027s term. His confirmation hearing will be a key indicator of how committed he is to this goal.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstHere are some of the most ineffective requests that I\u0027ve seen as a manager and a professor, along with a running commentary on what a cynical recommender might read between the lines. My hope is that we\u0027ll all get a little bit more thoughtful about who, how, and when we ask.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Some have suggested that it would be better for Congress to legislate net-neutrality rules instead of relying on the FCC\u0027s rule-making authority. That would be fine too; after all, Congress always has the prerogative to legislate. But the open Internet we know today occurred under our existing communications laws and the FCC\u0027s watch, so passing a law to trump the FCC\u0027s rules is premature.U.S. Senator from HawaiiSome men seem to be threatened that the childhood memories will be ruined or that a classic film will be emasculated. But there are at least 10 reasons that women will rock a remake of the 1980s classic in a demon and ghost-possessed 21st century.Author, \u0027Mothers of Intention: How Women \u0026 Social Media are Revolutionizing Politics in America\u0027 \u0026 E-I-C/Publisher, The Broad Side; President/CEO, Broad Side StrategiesThe Israelis must deny Netanyahu another term in office because should he win, his victory will demonstrate that they are following a blind shepherd who is systematically destroying Israel\u0027s vital relations with the U.S. at a time when Israel is in dire need of America\u0027s unmitigated backing.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUMost people celebrate their twenty-first birthday by drinking alcohol legally for the first time. For my twenty-first in 1993, I tried heroin for the first time. All it took was a small-scale, but measured, injection with the assistance of a friend.Clinical Director, Hazelden in Chicago, Licensed Clinical Social Worker. Recovery AdvocateIt is now \"cool\" to be willfully ignorant. Any sentence which begins with \"I\u0027m not a scientist,\" but ends with public policy suggestions regarding it, highlights the point. Ignorance has become a homeowner in America\u0027s discourse. It has a seat at the \"grown folks\" table and is asked its opinion. How in the hell did we get here?Host of \"The Mo\u0027Kelly Show\" on KFI AM640 and author of The Mo\u0027Kelly ReportEach February 7, we mark National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (NBHAAD). It\u0027s an opportunity for all of us to honor the memory of those we\u0027ve lost, and to call attention to the fact that HIV continues to disproportionately affect African American men, women, and youth.Secretary of Health \u0026 Human Services (HHS)To fight ideological extremism in the Middle East the main starting point must be youth. It is vitally important that Arab/Muslim youth are given satisfactory answers to their economic, community and spiritual needs. The challenge is difficult and there are no magic solutions.Palestinian journalistAs corporate volunteerism becomes an increasingly important part of the work experience, companies are coming up with new ways to embrace volunteering and tie it to their bottom lines.Founder and CEO, CausecastWe need an active, independent left willing to challenge the push for smaller government. A well-managed government can revitalize the economy even as it makes our world a better place to live. Many Americans seem to understand that instinctively. Where, then, is the movement that will make that argument?Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourGreece has been suffering from high levels of unemployment, and the standard of living has dropped precipitously, as a direct result of the cuts in government programs mandated by the EU and the IMF. The EU should have predicted this result: This was the great unlearned lesson from the experience of East-Central Europe over the last 25 years.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogOn National Cancer Prevention Day, we can acknowledge the random challenges of wind and wave, but celebrate the mastery of ship and sail, securely in our hands.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThere is much the United States and its allies can do to help developing countries meet the NCD challenge at relatively modest cost. By placing the cancer crisis far higher on the global health agenda, we have it in our power to spare millions from needless suffering and death.Founder and Chair of Global Strategy, Susan G. Komen; U.S. Ambassador to Hungary (2001-2003)U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has joined the growing chorus of top medical professionals and organizations in favor of reforming marijuana laws to allow access for medical purposes.Director of Communications Strategy, Drug Policy AllianceInstead of looking outwards for happiness, simply look within at all the ways you are preventing yourself from being happy in this very moment -- and work on letting them go. To get you started, here are 27 common things that prevent our happiness.Writer and founder of NotesOnBliss.com, your guidebook to happiness and creating a beautiful lifeAs an immunologist, come winter, I see a lot of children with viral infections, most often caused by respiratory viruses that affect the nose and throat -- and a lot of parents unhappy with the missed school days!

Does the public support these tax hikes, and how do their attitudes fit into larger perceptions about wealth?Research Coordinator for the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at UConnIf anything, there should be a movement to commend people like Marshawn Lynch, not detract from his reluctance to abide by the media\u0027s thirst for controversy. Our nation has enough self-absorbed athletes and celebrities, do we need more?Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsThese eight hotels -- whether perched on the rocking outcroppings of the Italian coast or hidden away amidst the rice fields of northern Thailand -- are some of the most romantic in the world and are the perfect places for a romantic rendezvous... with a little international flair.Oyster.com visits, photographs, reviews, and rates each hotel, uncovering the truth before it\u0027s \"uh-oh\" timeThe state of the world got more gruesome yesterday with the barbaric killing of Lieutenant Muath al-Kasabeh.

So let\u0027s talk.Mom of three, former journalist, voice behind www.ChokingOnApplesauce.comImplying that absence of a citation in an academic journal means medical advice has no merit is a misleading premise and misses a truth that practicing physicians acknowledge -- at least half the time that we are faced with a clinical decision, strong scientific evidence is lacking.Medical editor, The Huffington Post; Founder and president, Preventive Medicine Research InstituteInstead of spending their mega-fortunes on luxury hiding places to escape the mob, better to use that money to improve the conditions that have the populace thinking about tar and feathers or worse.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV.
