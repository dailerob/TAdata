But, stunningly, it is not. This needs to change. The presidential candidates\u0027 view of the role of government should be one of the central questions of the last 36 days of the campaign.

Rodman, 09.30.2008If we don\u0027t use this crisis as an opportunity, the pigs at the trough certainly will -- as they did after 9/11, and as Paulson and his gravediggers have been doing for the past few weeks.Read Post | CommentsBIODerek Shearer, 09.30.2008John McCain is more than the oldest candidate to run for president.

Holbrooke, 09.29.2008The real insights came in the revelations about the way each man thinks under pressure, and the way they interacted. The overall effect was exactly the opposite of what McCain hoped to achieve.Read Post | Comments (302)BIODean Baker, 09.29.2008The main cause of the economy\u0027s weakness is not insolvent banks and lack of credit -- it\u0027s the loss of $4-$5 trillion in housing equity as a result of the bubble\u0027s partial deflation.Read Post | Comments (85)BIOJeff Madrick, 09.30.2008Some may think these restrictions are just about getting even with the financial community. But this issue is not just about fairness. Compensation excess is at the heart of this crisis.Read Post | CommentsBIOGerald Posner, 09.29.2008In 1995, Ross Perot told me that McCain had a gambling problem and he had uncovered details that McCain was bailed out in the late 1980s from a big gambling debt by his wife, Cindy.Read Post | Comments (101)BIORobert L. Borosage, 09.29.2008Progressives should demand a real -- $200 billion or more -- stimulus that invests in new energy, extends unemployment benefits, aids states and localities to avoid debilitating cuts, and puts people to work.Read Post | Comments (85)BIOPeggy Drexler, 09.29.2008While consumer advertising has moved on, political advertising is caught in a curious time warp -- combining modern technology with the unfettered, unregulated ability to say down is up and the opponent hates puppies.Read Post | CommentsBIOKathleen Reardon, 09.29.2008Today\u0027s outcome should be a lesson to the Democratic leadership. The Republicans were able to make them look bad -- they let the Democrats take the lead in this bailout then pulled the rug out from under them.Read Post | Comments (179)BIOThomas Frank, 09.29.2008At business\u0027s urging, business was left up to its own devices; its own devices turned out to be precisely the things that our grandparents set up regulatory agencies to guard against.Read Post | Comments (141)Nathan Gardels, 09.29.2008Mitchell Bard, 09.29.2008Jacob Heilbrunn, 09.29.2008Steven Weber, 09.29.2008John R.
