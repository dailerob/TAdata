{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Bob Woodward reported that President Obama is \"psychologically\" out of Afghanistan. Good to hear. Unfortunately, a soldier who\u0027s only out of Afghanistan psychologically but not physically can still get killed. And many will. So Obama needs to match the physical with the psychological and bring our troops home. If he does, he\u0027ll have the backing of the American people: a new poll shows that nearly six in 10 Americans oppose the war in Afghanistan. At a time when so many are suffering here at home, we\u0027re spending $2.6 billion a week on a war of choice -- propping up a corrupt regime. In the process, we are killing civilians, strengthening the Taliban, and making us all less secure by losing the hearts and minds of the Muslim world. Talk about perverted priorities. It\u0027s time to bring that money home and do some nation building here in America.Read Post | CommentsJose Antonio Vargas, 10.01.2010Senior contributing editor, Huffington PostWhatever else The Social Network is, the film represents the biggest culmination yet of old media\u0027s disdain and misreading of new media.
