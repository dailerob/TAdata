{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Adding up the clues, it seems the culprit in the killing of Romney\u0027s chances just might be mind-numbing sleep deprivation among senior campaign advisors. While I was at the DNC in Charlotte, a well-sourced journalist told me that senior Romney advisor Eric Fehrnstrom sleeps only three or four hours with his devices beside him, then wakes and checks his email, sends out replies, and then gets another hour of sleep. It sounds like he and the rest of the campaign need to hit the off buttons on their devices and get some more restorative sleep, for more clarity and better judgment. Just last week, a study was published which showed that the light from computer screens interferes with our internal body clock and our sleep cycle. And according to sleep researchers from Harvard, \"Sleep deprivation negatively impacts our mood, our ability to focus, and our ability to access higher-level cognitive functions.\" Half a billion fundraising dollars is great, but \"higher-level cognitive functions\" is even greater.Read Post | Comments (207)Howard Fineman, 09/19/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupRomney\u0027s video proves to be a corollary to columnist Michael Kinsley\u0027s famous dictum that in politics, the biggest scandals arise when people say the most obviously true but usually unspoken things.Read Post | Comments (144)Dr. Patricia Fitzgerald and Mark Hyman, MD, 09/19/12We sensed a serious debate, er, brewing.
