{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilPresident, National Iranian American CouncilPart of the reason why opponents to a nuclear deal with Iran are so bewildered by President Barack Obama\u0027s diplomacy is because their belief that Iran can be forced to capitulate. They adhere to a George W. Bush administration-era argument: If the U.S. only were to ramp up pressure, it can dictate the terms of the deal instead of having to agree to a compromise. Nothing could be further from the truth. This argument is as reckless as it is disproven. In fact, the reason the Obama administration abandoned this path was because it realized that insisting on Iranian capitulation was more likely to lead to war than to victory.The economy toward which we\u0027re hurtling -- in which more and more is generated by fewer and fewer people who reap almost all the rewards, leaving the rest of us without enough purchasing power -- can\u0027t function.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027We could be falling into the abyss of a new dark age where nationalism, populism, and xenophobia rules the world order in a sinister combination of fanaticism, ignorance, and anti-science. Unlikely? No. Look to history.Author, \u0027The Global Economy in Transition\u0027I have concluded that the productive discussion I envisioned cannot occur in the shadow of active litigation and the resulting present intense polarity. For these reasons, I will not lecture at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the spring of 2015.Senior Advisor to the Provost at Brandeis University, Professor of LawWhile all water conservation is good, not all water conservation is equal. If you make a few smarter choices, you really shouldn\u0027t feel guilty about the things listed below -- provided you don\u0027t over-indulge.JournalistCheri Mah of the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic and Research Laboratory is a highly sought expert in the sports world. In answer to my questions, she shared insights on how athletes at every level can boost performance by getting more sleep, what\u0027s behind the recent surge in interest in athletes\u0027 sleep habits and how non-athletes can incorporate these lessons into their lives.An Oscar for \"Still Alice\" is shining the brightest light yet on Alzheimer\u0027s, but light isn\u0027t enough anymore. Attention isn\u0027t enough. It\u0027s time to get serious. Alzheimer\u0027s is exerting a powerful impact on American families -- on our health, our finances, and our futures. And women are disproportionately impacted.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistHistory shows that liberals need radicals. We need radicals because drastic change against entrenched evil and concentrated power requires personal bravery to the point of obsession. It requires a radical sensibility to look beyond today\u0027s limits and imagine what seems sheer impossibility within the current social order.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Pearson promotes Common Core and Common Core creates markets for Pearson. Teaching history the Pearson way means teaching it the Common Core way, without any meaningful content. The text, no matter how inaccurate or misleading, rules. Myth replaces history.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownI\u0027m sure most of us can\u0027t imagine being uprooted from our homes and forced to flee with only the clothes on our backs. But that\u0027s what millions of people face each day. As Syria enters its 5th year of conflict, 3.9 million people have fled Syria to neighboring countries.Co-host, MSNBC’s \u0027Morning Joe\u0027The Corinthian story is certainly an unjust one. These strikers have raised issues which go to the heart of our nation\u0027s entire student debt crisis. That crisis affects 41 million Americans, who hold an estimated $1.3 trillion in debt. Those are staggering numbers -- and if we do nothing they will continue to soar.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-Founder and President Emeritus, Presidio Graduate SchoolSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-founder, National Student Debt Jubilee ProjectWhat is likely to bedevil Republicans on this issue is not the amount of toughness they bring to the arena -- Democrats have often gone along with many of the harsh measures -- but the mismatch between what the right-wing base demands and what the public more broadly is ready to embrace.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesLet\u0027s get real, as the kids say. If Israel fails to get Washington to go to war with Iran, it will have lost a very big bet. More fantasizing will not get it out of that hole. Some Israelis of high rank recognize that; too many of their American sympathizers do not.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIt is a myth that the minimum wage is only for teens and entry level workers. Raising the minimum wage to $10 would impact over 15 million workers.Law Professor, Loyola University New Orleans, CCR Associate Legal DirectorYou probably missed this one. After all, most news coverage told people that Governor Walker signed a \"right to work\" bill. This was presented as a victory for workers\u0027 rights over the power of unions. In fact, it was about denying the people of Wisconsin the freedom of contract.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Like almost everyone, I find Putin\u0027s policies objectionable, and I think he\u0027s potentially dangerous. I\u0027m certainly not sympathetic to him, nor do I admire him. But I think he\u0027s shrewd. I also think we have largely underestimated him as a leader and his hostility toward the West.Director, Center on Congress at Indiana UniversityTrickle-down economics doesn\u0027t work, and frankly, it never has. If we want to restore a healthy middle class, we need a different approach, a virtuous cycle that begins with a high-quality public education that gives students the skills they need to get good jobs with fair wages.President, American Federation of TeachersActions matters more than words, and while Portman wishes to come across as measured, his decision to be among the 47 Republican senators who sent a letter to the leaders of Iran undermining the current diplomatic process was irresponsible at best and dangerous at worst.U.S. Senate Candidate, Cincinnati City CouncilmanWhen the time came for me to leave the country and fly to the United States for a graduate degree, my mother finally promised me the thing I had always wanted to hear: Go live a life where you will no longer have to face everyday struggles because you were born a woman.Entrepreneur, Writer, DreamerFor now, Ferguson has become the symbol and brand of the challenges we face in a multi-racial society. Perhaps this once sleepy little town has been waiting for this moment all along. Perhaps the country needs to reach deep into the heartland to get its heart right again.JournalistWhat about other sources of revenue? Establishing an honest notary service, cashing most checks, selling fishing and hunting licenses, wrapping holiday gifts, and accepting wine or beer for delivery are just a few congressionally prohibited proposals that have been put forward by postal activists and watchdogs.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI was about 7 then and didn\u0027t know it, but that single act would change my perspective on myself for years to come. Was being Chinese a joke? Was my race something to ridicule?High school musician and writerToday, no one knows if the clock of extinction for the species stands at two minutes before midnight or two minutes after. In spite of its exotic horns, the animal is unknown in traditional Chinese medicine. Rather, the last living remnants of the species risk being taken as by-catch, like sea turtles in a shrimper\u0027s net.Author, A Great Aridness: Climate Change and the Future of the SouthwestEvery adult American, of course, has the right to work. What this legislation does is help corporations and state governments cut workers\u0027 pay. Its intent is regressive. Republicans want to return America to the days when robber barons controlled workers\u0027 lives completely.International President, United SteelworkersOperation Streamline is all about besmirching migrants as criminals instead of processing their cases through civil or administrative immigration courts, as in the past.Writer, journalist, bloggerA 91-year-old woman calls her doctor complaining that she feels dizzy. No, that\u0027s not the beginning of a joke. It\u0027s what actually happened to my mother last week when she woke up feeling \u0027a little sick.\u0027 And here\u0027s the punch line. She ends up at the ER and in the hospital overnight.Founding director, Cherry Preschool; Blogger, ChicagoNowWe\u0027re talking about block grants because the Republican budget resolutions are coming out this week and such budgets have used this mechanism to propose deep cuts in Medicaid and SNAP (food stamps).Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI\u0027m joined by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was elected in a landslide in 2013. The high cost of living has made life increasingly difficult for low-income residents of the Big Apple. To address this issue, Mayor de Blasio has set forth a sweeping anti-poverty agenda.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorA day of reckoning is arriving in Appalachia. A renewed coalition of citizens groups called the People\u0027s Foot movement is confronting state and federal agencies directly for their complicity in ignoring the growing and indisputable evidence on deadly health effects from mountaintop removal mining.Author of \"Reckoning at Eagle Creek,\" and \"United States of Appalachia\" www.jeffbiggers.comSilly, sick, demeaning cracks made by such as the canned Univision host Rodner Figueroa likening First Lady Michelle Obama to a Planet of the Apes character are not new. The long, sordid and savage history of racist stereotyping of African-Americans has been the stock in trade of race baiting and racial ridicule for more than century.Author and political analystThe 47 Senate Republicans who warned Iranians against any nuclear agreement with Barack Obama that a Republican successor could revoke \"with the stroke of a pen\" billed their audacious letter to the clerical regime in Tehran as a civics lesson in the American constitutional system.International affairs analyst and commentatorGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"STAR ROOKIE RETIRES OVER CONCUSSIONS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
