{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"May 29, 2007APSee all posts »BIOIt\u0027s still the same place, with the same address, the same mission, and the same attitude that has always made HuffPost such a great read. It\u0027s just that now there is much more of it to love. And to organize it all we\u0027ve created five new sections: Media, Business, Entertainment, a culture and lifestyle section called Living Now, and a Politics section that will feature our political editor Tom Edsall and a shared-content partnership with Josh Marshall and Talking Points Memo. Plus, we\u0027ve improved the design, navigation, and search function to help you find what you want more easily. The front page will continue to feature our signature group blog and breaking news stories, but it was clearly no longer big enough to contain all the great stories, blog posts, and features we wanted to share with you. So each new section will have its own \"front page\" with fresh editorial talent and a constantly growing list of bloggers. Of course, these things don\u0027t happen overnight, and this change is the culmination of a lot of hard work by my brilliant partner Kenny Lerer and our wonderful editorial and technical teams. But the main reason we\u0027ve grown to the point where we need to expand is you, the HuffPost community. The blogosphere is a constantly evolving conversation, and we\u0027re blessed to have such an active, passionate, and vocal readership. And don\u0027t stop now: let us know what you think of the changes we\u0027ve made by sending an email to updates@huffingtonpost.com. We\u0027ll definitely be listening and acting on your ideas. Thanks for reading, posting, talking back, and making Huffington Post what it is today.Read Post | Comments (84)BIOJames Pinkerton, 05.29.2007When politicians lose themselves in the pyrotechnics of their own romantic ecstasies, even artists will feel compelled to step in and provide the needed dousing.Read Post | CommentsBIOGary Hart, 05.28.2007The alternative is not for us to become the war party once again, nor is it to try to outdo hawks in military spending on new weapons systems.Read Post | Comments (54)BIONora Ephron, 05.28.2007Would Rosie go too far?
