{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWe may be at an interesting inflection point in Washington. The latest debacle -- the fight to extend unemployment insurance and the payroll tax cut -- appears to have demonstrably hurt the Republicans and helped the Democrats, especially the president. Moreover, one can probably expect that ensuing fights will redound similarly, as the public appears to be internalizing the meme that the Democrats are fighting for the middle class while the Republicans are fighting for the rich. Politically, this is a dangerous possibility for Republicans, especially in an election year. Could we be looking at the moment when the hyper-partisanship undermining our democracy began to crack?Read Post | Comments (29)David Paul, 12/24/11President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThis month the Republicans took a stand against tax cuts because of the fiscal implications of those cuts. For the first time in recent memory, Milton Friedman and the Republican Party of my grandfather were redeemed. This was a significant point that should not be lost.Read Post | Comments (126)Yoani Sanchez, 12/25/11Award-winning Cuban bloggerLast weekend Vaclav Havel died, just at the time when he was most read in Cuba. He left and we can\u0027t hear his voice in a classroom of our University, nor listen to his extensive collection of anecdotes about the years of Soviet control.Read Post | CommentsMarjorie Cohn, 12/25/11Professor at Thomas Jefferson School of LawIf Bradley Manning did what he is accused of doing, he should not be tried as a criminal. He should be hailed as a national hero, much like Daniel Ellsberg, whose release of the Pentagon Papers helped to expose the government\u0027s lies and end the Vietnam War.Read Post | Comments (177)Brad Balfour, 12/25/11Veteran Interviewer; Pop Culture ChroniclerExotic locations, fast cars, beautiful women, and crazy gadgets are the excitements in today\u0027s cinematic thrillers -- whether they be spy-oriented, crime adventure, or a suspense mystery.Read Post | CommentsEllen Kanner, 12/25/11syndicated columnist, the Edgy VeggieKissing at midnight on New Year\u0027s Eve is great -- hell, kissing anytime is great -- but dishing up hopping john on New Year\u0027s Day is when the new year really begins for me.Read Post | CommentsSusan Blumenthal, M.D. and Beth Hoffman, 12/25/11As we reflect on the things that we are most thankful for this holiday season, don\u0027t forget the importance of good health!Read Post | CommentsLaura Stepp, 12/25/11Pulitzer Prize-winning journalistHere\u0027s a question: how about the millions of grandmas and grandpas who can\u0027t afford to butt out, who raise grandchildren because their own children can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to? Let\u0027s give these women and men a shout out this holiday season.Read Post | CommentsPaul Kleyman, 12/25/11Director of the Ethnic Elders Newsbeat at New America MediaDemocratic leaders and the White House are congratulating themselves as they depart for the holiday weekend about their tax-holiday victory over GOP hardliners. But the payroll tax holiday, like most vacations, will have its bill to pay.Read Post | Comments (18)Judith Johnson, 12/25/11Author, Educator, Coach and Interfaith MinisterThe holidays come and go every year. Don\u0027t stay stuck in a bad emotional drama. The willingness to do it differently will always create the means and ability you need. Trust yourself and have the courage to step free.Read Post | CommentsJill Di Donato, 12/24/11Adjunct Professor of English, The Fashion Institute of Technology, New YorkIn my experience, a little sexual release here and there makes everything just a lit-tle more manageable.Read Post | Comments (56)Joel Cohen, 12/25/11Criminal defense lawyerWe don\u0027t weep for Sandusky. As do all \"commentators,\" we have the right to \"personally\" convict him based on our own idiosyncratic views of the case. But why has the public convicted him at this early stage?Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 12/25/11Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterAs a new year looms, we might consider abandoning the quest for superficial perfection -- and embrace the pursuit of humbler, but deeper good. The particular advantage of good over perfect is... We could actually get there from here.Read Post | CommentsMenachem Wecker, 12/25/11Religious art blogger, Houston ChronicleA Che Guevara portrait isn\u0027t necessarily going to be successful because of it\u0027s subject matter. The photograph actually needs to be greater than the competition, just like Christ\u0027s majesty doesn\u0027t mean every crucifixion is going to be great art.Read Post | CommentsJess Coleman, 12/25/11Student, New York City Lab SchoolWhile Protect IP and SOPA are significantly flawed, Congress should shake off the misguided criticism and move forward to combat the only big issue that is experiencing bipartisan support.Read Post | CommentsLori Culwell, 12/25/11Author, marketer, tech nerdIt\u0027s the holiday season, and if you\u0027re like me, you\u0027re playing even more games of Angry Birds than usual. Along the way, I have picked up some sage wisdom from those self-sacrificing birds and their mortal pig enemies.Read Post | CommentsAlex Horsey, 12/24/1116-year-old Editor at Wilson High School\u0027s StatesmanThough I\u0027ve grown out of Disney programming, I will not be happy with the network until they issue a formal, public apology.Read Post | CommentsJoel Rubin, 12/25/11Director of Policy and Government Affairs, Ploughshares FundInstead of political pandering and promoting a reckless policy, Obama is making it clear that while he seeks to resolve the challenge from Iran, he also has policy red lines that should not be crossed.Read Post | Comments (58)Chris Weigant, 12/25/11Political Writer and Blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThis year we turn to the Democrats to find the winner of Destined For Political Stardom. If Elizabeth Warren manages to wrest Teddy Kennedy\u0027s old Senate seat away from the Republican usurper, she will indeed be on the road to Democratic stardom.Read Post | CommentsMichelle Chen, 12/25/11Blogger, \u0027Colorlines\u0027 and \u0027In These Times\u0027Maybe what prime time television needs right now isn\u0027t a showcase of Muslims being as ultra-American as possible, but a conscientious exploration of why our image of the \"All American\" is actually a complete fiction.Read Post | CommentsLita Smith-Mines, 12/25/11Real estate attorney; Editor in Chief, Boating Times Long IslandWhat I\u0027m looking for in exchange for my $20 million investment will cost the cash-strapped Mets nothing: the acknowledgement that fans of the team actually matter.Read Post | CommentsJane Harman, 12/24/11Director, President and CEO, Woodrow Wilson CenterWith all the eggnog celebrations about the two month extension of the payroll tax cut, few have remembered that one thing was left off: funding to implement a law written by Rep. Fred Upton and me to create U.S. jobs and remove tons of carbon from the atmosphere.Read Post | Comments (71)Stewart J.
