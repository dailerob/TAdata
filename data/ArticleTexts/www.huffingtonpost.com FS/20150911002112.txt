{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogDespite all the meetings, promises, and apocalyptic threats, global carbon emissions have risen from the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 until today -- from around 6.5 billion metric tons per year to nearly 10 billion. If both China and the U.S. had tackled this issue back in 2001, perhaps we wouldn\u0027t currently be in this pickle. Chalk that up as another opportunity cost (which might just cost us the planet). Instead of haggling over currency, hacking, and sea-lanes, the two superpowers should be thinking big. Between them, the U.S. and China account for nearly one-third of the global economy, nearly one-quarter of the world\u0027s population, and more than two-fifths of the world\u0027s carbon emissions. What these two countries do by definition has an enormous global impact.What we are looking at is a middle class that is dying, literally, and a party that supposedly represents them holding their head under water. As long as the GOP fights middle class progress they will have a difficult time reaching the votes they need outside of rural areas and winning the presidency.Former Intelligence Specialist, Veteran, WriterWe are sequencing the world -- from ourselves to all of the organisms upon which we depend as a living planet. In the future, our planetary genome might include new life forms built in the lab; there is even talk of the possibility of a resurrected Neanderthal, carried by a surrogate human mother. Science fiction? Not anymore.Author, Biocode: The New Age of GenomicsSince 9/11, Africa has increasingly been viewed by the Pentagon as a place of problems to be remedied by military means. And year after year, as terror groups have multiplied, proxies have foundered, and allies have disappointed, the U.S. has doubled down again and again.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comI am a woman in a man\u0027s profession, and it\u0027s certainly time that the prevalence of societal sex-stereotyping is publicly addressed. We begrudgingly accept this level of misogyny and anti-family sentiment when it\u0027s subtle, constitutive and mixed with praise for being tough. After all, this is surgery. And surgeons are tough.Breast cancer surgeon, mom, wife.There are plenty of reasons to get your credit into the best shape possible. New car models are hitting showrooms, real estate may become more expensive (many believe the Federal Reserve will raise the prime lending rate), and (like it or not) the holiday shopping season is almost upon us.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Because of something called carried interest, the top 25 hedge fund mangers paid a lower tax rate than the average kindergarten teacher in 2014. Billionaire hedge fund managers don\u0027t need a tax break, and there is no reason this loophole should exist.109th Mayor of New York CityThere was a moment at a recent rally when the nature of the tuition beast was suddenly, and unforgettably, revealed; when \"Mandy,\" an anonymous NYU junior, took the stage to tell exactly how, and why, she had no choice but to become a prostitute to meet NYU\u0027s soaring price.Professor of Culture and Communication, New York UniversityI fear that many of my Republican colleagues do not understand that war must be a last resort, not the first resort. It is easy to go to war, it not so easy to comprehend the unintended consequences of that war.U.S. Senator from VermontSo what lies behind Trump\u0027s apparent about-face? Is his statement that the opening of U.S.-Cuba relations \"is fine\" just an off-the-cuff comment, a brief aside in a long interview that covered many other topics? Or does it signal a change in his political calculations?Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Purdue UniversityHillary\u0027s move to the right on Iran creates an opening for pro-diplomacy Democrats to insist that the Democratic presidential nominee remain true to Obama\u0027s policy of keeping the door open to deeper U.S.-Iran cooperation. Calling for direct U.S.-Iran talks to help end the Syrian civil war would be a great place to start.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyLast year, we highlighted Jimmy\u0027s story on Huffington Post, which led to a number of bone-marrow cheek-swab submissions, but unfortunately Jimmy is still looking for a match. As we approach the 14th anniversary of the events on September 11th, we\u0027re taking a moment to remember his story -- and hope to find a match to save this honorable heroes life.Kiva FellowIt\u0027s time for leaders to put the burden of migration in its full context and take on the opportunity to provide hope and opportunity before families are without options and forced into dangerous and desperate attempts to migrate.Director, Policy and Advocacy - A World at School; Director, Policy and Research - Global Business Coalition for EducationNobody knew what had happened: Dad didn\u0027t, nor did the police. I knew, though. My body was screaming the truth at me, great waves of horror sweeping through it. And, as hard as my body screamed, my head fought against what was utterly inconceivable.Firefighter, Author \u0026 Physiotherapist.It is time that anyone running to be POTUS does more than lip service to one of the most egregious tax evasion schemes and one of the biggest contributors to the 1 percent stealing from the 99 percent.Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationA patent recently acquired by Facebook could conceivably permit loan servicers to gain access to the credit ratings of a loan applicant\u0027s social network and then use that information to determine whether the applicant qualifies for a loan.Director, ACLU National Office\u0027s Racial Justice ProgramThe frustrating thing about this new epidemic is that we\u0027ve known for decades that there are practical, common-sense solutions to preventing HIV among people who use drugs. But we\u0027ve let our fears and misconceptions about drug use and addiction stand in the way.Director of Communications Strategy, Drug Policy AllianceI kiss him goodbye before his shift and I don\u0027t allow myself to think about the danger. I can\u0027t. I would never sleep again if I did. Instead I watch my boys play with fire trucks, and pretend to put out fires with the hose and I laugh at their imaginations. Deep down part of me hopes they will outgrow this stage because to be perfectly honest I don\u0027t think I could handle all three of the men in my life being firefighters.Wife, mom, writer, runner, sleep enthusiast, blogger at Outsmarted MommyYes, they were bullshit. And yes, they were probably worthwhile. In other words, the MDGs may -- may -- have been the right development initiative for the world of the late 1990s, but they are increasingly irrelevant to the one we have now.Blogger, Rottin\u0027 in DenmarkObama has done more than any previous president to restrict greenhouse gas emissions, but his administration remains stuck in a contradictory policy of promoting fossil fuel extraction that threatens to \"lock-in\" decades of emissions that we can\u0027t afford.Researcher for Greenpeace USAAmerica\u0027s leadership is best displayed when we strive to live up to our values as a nation. The values of opportunity, democracy and hard work are what drew so many Latinos to this country. The nuclear deal with Iran is one small part of making those values a reality.Executive Director, Presente ActionRosh Hashanah is right around the corner. From Matzo Ball Soup to Apple Cake, these foolproof recipes will make your New Year\u0027s meal extra meaningful and delicious.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomWhether it\u0027s for a family vacation or visiting relatives, air travel is a necessity for passengers of all ages. Infants and toddlers CAN travel well, so long as their travel companions are well-prepared.Founder, HaveBabyWillTravel.comThe refugees I have known didn\u0027t feel entitled to anything. They hated living off of food stamps, welfare, government cheese, and in an internment-like and/or poverty stricken communities. But they appreciated the assistance, making the best of what came their way.Host of Finding Rebecca podcast and multi-dimensional freelancer.It seems the mainstream media is finally starting to pay a little bit of attention to Bernie Sanders. Unfortunately, that little bit of attention usually involves futile attempts to goad Sanders into dissing Hillary Clinton, or asking him to comment on the \"authenticity\" both he and Trump seem to possess; authenticity which, polls suggest, the electorate craves.Sociologist, author of Beatleness, boomerbabe, qualitative research consultant, wellness advocate, progressive Democrat, defender of reason.Every season the push for racial diversity during Fashion Week is as much a part of the conversation as what\u0027s trending on designer runways. However, spotting models representing all shades and sizes continues to be more of the exception than the rule.Editor-in-Chief, Essence MagazineThis slight tension between me and my daughter has been present for a few weeks now. She\u0027s growing up, not a little girl anymore, but not quite big one yet either. She needs and wants me, and I need and want her, and yet something is new. Something is different.I wear lots of hats. And I like them all to sparkle. Read more at www.emilyballard.comToday we launched a campaign will make it possible for all of America to be great. Not just Silicon Valley or Hollywood. Not just Nashville or Broadway. Not just the heartland or the White Mountains. But even Washington, D.C. too. Today we have launched a campaign to give us a government we can be proud of again.Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentCongress is back, and they\u0027re already moaning about how much they have to do in September. After all, they\u0027ve got an upcoming budgetary train wreck to create, the Pope is going to visit and -- first on their list of looming deadlines -- they\u0027re supposed to vote on the Iran nuclear deal.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comLiving as whites within a system that gives us unfair advantages, we often continue to act out those advantages with people of color, even as we seek to address inequity. We expect to lead when we should follow. We expect to teach when we need to learn.Dismantling racism from the inside outOpening the new community toilet may lack the glamour of cutting the ribbon on a new hospital, so fewer politicians lobby for their communities to gain sanitation.Chief Executive of WaterAidGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
