{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason Linkins, Sam Stein and Zach CarterAmerica may be on the verge of a catastrophic default on its national debt. There would be no real reason for this default -- it can easily be avoided, and is only being considered because our politicians, particularly Republicans in Washington, have gone insane. So what should you do, in the meantime, to prepare yourself? On Oct. 17, the government runs out of extraordinary measures and the state will begin failing to make good on its obligations. Absent a congressional debt ceiling hike or Obama debt ceiling magic, the U.S. will be missing bond payments by the end of the month, plunging the world into turmoil and chaos. How will you survive this new world order? Well, you probably won’t. But here’s how to give yourself a fighting chance.Comments (1,569)Eric IdleEnglish comedian, Monty PythonCurrently you appear to be almost in a state of civil war. If one party can shut down the government, then the social compact to rule is broken. In most other democracies this simply could not happen.Comments (653)Jeffrey Burns, MDChief of Critical Care Medicine, Boston Children\u0027s HospitalIt was a child who nearly died that made me realize just how drastically my profession had to change. Because nearly 8 million children died in 2010 before reaching the age of five, in large part because of imminently treatable illnesses, and because 57 countries globally are facing a human resources health crisis and of those countries, each only has 1.13 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with 13.22 per 1,000 in the U.S.CommentsNiels Gerson LohmanWriter, designer, musicianI have been cursed at a Chinese border. In Dubai, my passport was studied by three veiled women for over an hour and my suitcase completely dismembered. In the Philippines I had to bribe someone in order to get my visa extended for a few days. But never, ever, will I return to the United States of America.Comments (1,985)Rielle HunterAuthor, \u0027In Hindsight, What Really Happened: The Revised Edition: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me\u0027I behaved badly. That may seem obvious to you but it\u0027s taken me a long time to admit that, even to myself. For years I was so viciously attacked by the media and the world that I felt like a victim. I now realize that the attacks are actually beside the point. The point is: I behaved badly.Comments (231)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolUnlike our counterparts in Southern Europe, the United States is blessed to have a fairly steady economy these days. So why are we flirting with a historic default on U.S. government bonds that will harm the U.S. credit and credibility for decades to come?Comments (14)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeI hope that the brinkmanship we\u0027re seeing in today\u0027s Congress will soon be a thing of the past and that we will realize that all of our children, from Democratic and Republican families, will be growing up in the same nation.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorPlease know that I didn\u0027t mean to hurt your feelings. I just wanted to let you know that your efforts to create a dual system of publicly funded schools turns back the clock to the shameful era before the Brown decision. And I wanted you to know that your reliance on standardized testing is a grand mistake.Comments (145)Josh Stearns and John CusackToday, the Freedom of the Press Foundation is launching a major new initiative to ensure that any newsroom can create a simple and secure way for whistleblowers and sources to anonymously contact journalists.CommentsDan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027Mutual focus -- paying attention to each other -- is the key ingredient in rapport. We can\u0027t have chemistry with someone without such full focus. And given the zillion distractions we all face, the need to make a conscious effort to create these rich moments has never been greater.CommentsJonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillThe premise of the complaint that we don\u0027t normally have to endure politicization of our major national sporting events is simply false. Examples abound, but the most unrelenting one is the steady diet sports fans have been fed of nearly compulsory worshipfulness of our armed forces.CommentsLiterally, DarlingOnline magazine for twenty-something womenOh yeah, you can fill out a sweater like it\u0027s nobody\u0027s business, and you certainly get male eyes on you, but with your giant ta-tas comes a life of watching your boobs pop out of bras, shirts and dresses like they\u0027re rampaging bulls on the streets of Pamplona.Comments (396)C. Cryn JohannsenFounder and Director of All Education Matters, JournalistWhen it comes to student loans, the ones owned by the U.S. government, things could get problematic if the U.S. Treasury finds itself selling off its assets.CommentsThomas McKennaWriter \u0026 BloggerCommentsJeff MadrickRoosevelt Institute Senior Fellow; author, \u0027Age of Greed\u0027It\u0027s very important that President Obama and his aides make clear to the American public that the Republican Party\u0027s right wing, supported by moderates, offered no serious deal to him by proposing a postponement of their threat to let the U.S. default.Comments (71)Roy CooperAttorney General of North CarolinaFor the first time since Reconstruction, North Carolina has a General Assembly and governorship controlled by the extreme factions of the Republican Party, and their legislative super majority means their power is unchecked. It\u0027s as if the Tea Party created its own playground of extremist fantasies.Comments (173)Bianca JaggerFounder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationThe Ecuadorian communities were the victims of exploitation by a multinational corporation, Texaco. Their lives, and that of their children, are affected by the toxic waters that leaked into water sources on which they are dependent. With their legal team on trial, who will pursue justice for the Ecuadorian plaintiffs now?Comments (14)Vivien Lesnik WeismanFilmmakerOne could argue that a 10-year sentence for the horrific act of attempting to blow up a bridge is too light a sentence. But in the case that has come to be known as the Cleveland 4, one would be dead wrong.CommentsRobert GreenwaldFilmmaker, Brave New FoundationOliver Stone, Cenk Uygur, Tom Morello, Henry Rollins, and Shepard Fairey -- all progressive heroes and leading forces in their field -- have lent their voices in praising our upcoming investigative documentary Unmanned: America\u0027s Drone Wars.CommentsDeborah CaldwellReligion and politics writerIf the U.S. breaches its debt ceiling this week, leaders of a little-known far-right movement called Christian Reconstructionism can claim partial responsibility.Comments (2,153)Rep. Gwen MooreU.S. Representative for Wisconsin\u0027s 4th Congressional DistrictInstead of working to further improve our housing outlook, House Republicans have decided to put our recovery at risk. Today, our entire federal government is being held hostage by a minority of the majority. With this shutdown, the GOP is undermining the housing recovery.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkYes, a man waved a Confederate flag in front of the home of an African-American family. And the elected officials who organized, spoke, marched or promoted this rally are just as responsible as that man for this ugly display of bigotry.Comments (267)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Many Americans may be asking themselves: Why should I care about the debt ceiling, or the -- barring Congressional action -- coming default? Put simply, unlike corporate tax cuts, a debt ceiling default will have a trickle-down effect that will affect your wallet in one way or another.Comments (70)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (25)Carol-Lynn ParenteExecutive Producer, \u0027Sesame Street\u0027Rosita the monster, Ovejita the lamb, and Mando, Sesame Street\u0027s newest human cast member, ensure that Hispanic culture remains an important part of the iconic show\u0027s curriculum. We\u0027re always celebrating Hispanic heritage on Sesame Street, but we\u0027re especially excited to celebrate it during Hispanic Heritage Month.CommentsJessica AlbaActressI\u0027m a DIYer at heart. I believe that making (and enjoying) beautiful, stylish things should be simple, fun, and affordable. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so excited about Martha Stewart\u0027s American Made program, a celebration of makers and doers taking place this week in New York City.CommentsJanet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe Fed\u0027s lending to the global banking system through front and back doors has distorted the value of U.S. dollar. Foreign central banks engage in money printing to keep in step. As a result, we\u0027ve inflated distorted asset bubbles on a scale never before seen in the history of the world.Comments (16)Penny HerscherPresident and CEO, FirstRainYou use chips in your car, in your phone, in your TV, in your fridge, when you play a video game, when you text, Skype or blog, in the bar code reader at the grocery checkout, when you take a photo, as your luggage is routed through an airport -- any time you use electronics today you are using chips.CommentsMichael T. KlareAuthor and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeWhat we\u0027re seeing is a sea change in elite thinking on the future availability and attractiveness of fossil fuels. There are good reasons to be deeply skeptical of such claims, but that hardly matters when they are gaining traction in Washington and on Wall Street.CommentsEric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe extraordinary shutdown maneuver, based upon unprecedented demands, only begins to make sense when the truly extremist nature of the GOP\u0027S activist base is taken into account.Comments (24)Kathryn CatalinoLiteracy AssistantOur beautiful, perfect daughter, Callie Elizabeth Catalino, was born at 8:03 p.m. on May 31, 2011. I whispered to her that I loved her and that I would miss her every day of my life. I asked her to give us strength to continue on, to make it through each minute of our \"new normal.\"Comments (20)Steven FulopMayor, Jersey CityRepublican opposition to the ACA has made the fights about Social Security and Medicare look like a walk in the park. What is almost criminal is how opponents of the law are essentially denying Americans their now constitutionally-guaranteed rights.Comments (533)Salvatore Bono, 2013.15.10Les Leopold, 2013.15.10Penny Herscher, 2013.15.10Richard L.
