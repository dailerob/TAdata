{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsEven the most cynical amongst us were stunned when the U.S. Senate voted down a watered down, bipartisan, partial background check for gun purchases that\u0027s supported by some 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members. This happened because money has near-complete control of our political system. The NRA outspent the Brady Center to Control Gun Violence by 73 to 1 last year. As Gabby Giffords said in her brilliant New York Times op-ed, senators betrayed the people because of a deep fear of the NRA unseating them from office. The NRA has that power because they have and spend real political money.Comments (192)Frank WarrenFounder, PostSecret ProjectI began collecting and sharing secrets in 2004. I printed 3,000 self-addressed postcards with simple instructions about sharing an artful secret. I passed them out to strangers on the streets of Washington, D.C., not knowing what to expect.Comments (15)Nancy RappaportAssociate professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical SchoolAs the hostage negotiation continued and we sat down to dinner, I prayed that we\u0027d come out of lockdown a safer, more caring community. I loaded the plates and raised a glass, with the hope that my fellow citizens will find the strength to heal.Comments (24)Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupIn ways we never could have imagined, suspected terrorists with roots in a distant land and an ancient history have overrun the streets of Boston and Cambridge that are sacred to our own history. Well, there is no \"own\" anymore. As industrial Britain was rising around him, Wordsworth complained in the 19th century that the \"world is too much with us.\" He had no idea.Comments (593)Lorenzo VidinoSenior fellow, Center for Security Studies, ETH Zurich, SwitzerlandOver the next few days we will learn more about Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, from their childhood in Central Asia and their arrival to America up to the last days before and after their alleged attack against the Boston Marathon.Comments (25)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerThis week, starting with the tragic and sensless bombing of the Boston Marathon on Monday, through a riveting manhunt for two fugitive brothers, and ending in the death of one and apprehension of the other, Social Brother showed us just how powerful his genie (Internet mobile social photography) has become.CommentsDoug AndersonArtist, Writer and SchoolteacherAs I\u0027m writing this, the surviving suspect is being carted off to the hospital under police escort.We\u0027re free. We\u0027re proof that being free is not the end of the world. It\u0027s the end of his world.Comments (48)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe United States Senate\u0027s failure to pass common sense gun safety measures is a moral failure of great magnitude. We must stop this relentless war against our children and dethrone the NRA whose reign obstructs what 90 percent of Americans want.Comments (22)Heidi LeggAuthorWhat\u0027s it feel like to be in lockdown less than two miles from the danger with two young children soon to wake? Surreal, jittery, fraudulent and achingly real.CommentsBrian Glyn WilliamsProfessor of Islamic Studies at Univ of Mass. DartmouthWhile there are no links between Chechen insurgents/jihadists/terrorists and Al Qaeda, there is a long and bloody record of Chechen terrorism against a dominant state that may have inspired the two Chechen American brothers to carry out their senseless act of terrorism against a country that gave them refuge from their own war torn homeland.Comments (28)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesSo a boy can come out as gay, be a great scout and be accepted by the organization but not even think about being a scoutmaster as an adult? And how can a gay scout feel that he is not stigmatized by the Boy Scouts of America when the organization is still discriminating against gay adults?Comments (250)Amanda PeetEvery Child By Two Ambassador to the Shot@Life CampaignThe international supply of vaccines is not the problem, it\u0027s making sure moms and their children have access to them that is the major issue... it\u0027s so frustrating to know that we have the medicine, without being able to deliver it.CommentsWendy BradfordWriter and Blogger, Mama One to ThreeAs I am writing, I am also shopping online. As my husband has been entering and leaving the kitchen, I am repeatedly, quickly, and with a good measure of panic, minimizing that shopping window.CommentsBrian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityMuch speculation revolves around the fact that the brothers are ethnic Muslim Chechens from the Caucasus region where an intermittent, yet bloody conflict has existed for the last two decades, but nationalist sentiment has existed far longer than that.Comments (474)Joseph Young and Melissa Scholes YoungAssistant professor and writing instructor, American UniversityWe don\u0027t want the Boston Marathon bombers to be us. We don\u0027t claim them. They can\u0027t be Americans. As soon as suspects were identified, we rejected these young men. Even some of their family did. We blame them because of our fear.Comments (131)Michelle HagopianExecutive Director, Armenian National Committee of America Eastern RegionI take for granted how wonderful it is to live in a country where, on the average day, I do not fear for my life. I know not all Americans have that luxury. But ever since 9/11 and the upswing in mass shootings, I\u0027ve been uneasy. This week has been a wakeup call that we are never truly safe.CommentsDavid Reddix and Steve CapperThe Waldos stand by our true story of 420 origination about meeting at the Louis Pasteur statue at San Rafael High at 4:20 p.m. during the 1971 school year to smoke and go to Pt. Reyes.Comments (30)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostThis is not the first time we have been knocked off our feet, and we are not the first generation to pick ourselves back up. That is normal. It will take us a while. We\u0027ll mourn and grieve and recalibrate. And then... We\u0027ll get started.Comments (206)Huffington PostAs Boston was in lockdown mode Friday, April 19, while law enforcement agencies continued the manhunt for suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, we invited those in the area to blog about their experience.Comments (63)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsRising sea level is what linked Sandy directly to global warming. Over the last century, the ocean off the New York coast rose 13 to 16 inches, making flooding from Sandy a lot worse.Comments (51)Dr. Pepper SchwartzProfessor of Sociology, University of WashingtonSecrets and lies are commonplace in relationships, not only in the United States, but in the world. 43 percent of men and 33 percent of women say they keep major secrets from each other.Comments (18)Patricia Watson, Ph.D.Senior educational specialist for the National Center for PTSD and assistant professor at Dartmouth Medical School in the Department of PsychiatryMany people directly exposed to mass violence will have traumatic stress reactions, and such reactions may occur off and on, even years later. But these reactions should not necessarily be regarded as pathological responses or even as precursors of subsequent disorder.CommentsFrank BuaWriter, Educator, Gay DadThere may not be an Electoral College for public opinion, but don\u0027t insult our intelligence. The Scouts have not had some kind of homosexual epiphany; the only reason they are having this public conversation is because of the monumental pressure that has rained down on them like an unrelenting avalanche.Comments (20)Alfred Ryan NerzAuthor, \u0027Marijuanamerica: One Man\u0027s Quest to Understand America\u0027s Dysfunctional Love Affair with Weed\u0027Just as Prohibition did little to stem the flow of alcohol into Americans\u0027 gullets, its repeal did little to resolve the problems that alcohol abuse bestows upon our collective psyche. Which is why, when I think about the future of marijuana in this country, it is with a devil on one shoulder, and an angel on the other.Comments (31)Nathaniel FrankAuthor, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027Should we have to adopt a belief we don\u0027t really hold in order to feel part of the larger American family who were collectively targeted on Monday, and who are grieving and searching for answers as part of one people?Comments (500)Robert M. RandolphChaplain, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyAt 4 p.m. I have a wedding rehearsal. Maybe that is the way to derive meaning from days like today. Look evil in the eye, affirm your love for one another and step forward. That takes a courage that can banish fear.Comments (19)Arianna HuffingtonThis week\u0027s issue tells the story of the tragedy in Boston in pictures -- the marathon, the bombing, the aftermath, and the runners, onlookers, and first responders who came together to help one another in one of the city\u0027s darkest hours. And as part of our ongoing examination of stress in our lives, we look at how \"derushing\" our careers can yield many benefits in the long run.CommentsBen ThomasFounder, The ConnectomeIf the act of keeping a secret takes such a toll on our minds and bodies, and the act of revealing one is so freeing, is it truly healthy to keep secrets at all?CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comSome weeks, I sit down to write this weekly wrapup, and find that there isn\u0027t that much to talk about, because nothing much happened that particular week. This isn\u0027t one of those weeks.Comments (26)David RopeikAuthor, \u0027How Risky Is It, Really?\u0027Our responses may not make intellectual sense tomorrow, or whenever this calms down (hopefully with no or minimal additional violence), when we can look back at things in the cool calm of rational hindsight, but they make emotional sense now. Because we are afraid.Comments (63)Erica ZidelBoston native and founder of SittingAround.com\"Mommy,\" he said, \"I accidentally turned on the news. I saw the guy.\" He paused for a minute before continuing. \"Mommy, he looked like he was a teenager. That\u0027s a kid, isn\u0027t it? Why would a kid do this?\"Comments (30)John Pavley, 2013.20.04Olivia Bouler, 2013.20.04George Heymont, 2013.20.04Regina Weinreich, 2013.20.04Toshe Ayo-Ariyo, 2013.20.04Eric E.
