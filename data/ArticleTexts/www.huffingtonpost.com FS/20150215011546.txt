{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027I live on the outskirts of Chapel Hill (across the tracks, literally). It\u0027s been a heartbreaking time for everyone here, a frightening time for many Muslims (and those who might \"look Muslim\") in the region, and also a time of stirring, heartfelt solidarity and shared mourning. At a vigil at UNC Wednesday night, which was so full I couldn\u0027t hear the words from the stage but so hushed we could hear one another breathe, it was the perfect American ordinariness of the victims\u0027 family photos that brought me to tears. It\u0027s also the American ordinariness of the killer\u0027s images and attitudes that scares and saddens me. People have been quick to interpret these horrible slayings. Here are a few thoughts on how the world looks from here.NBC News\u0027 investigative unit has a unique opportunity to find out why its award-winning journalism fell so short of the mark on one of the biggest domestic stories of this young century. Whether they succeed or fail will be far more important than the ultimate fate of Brian Williams.Your dog\u0027s best friendIf the United States is truthfully aiming to curb its global military endeavors, neither Congress nor the president are making that clear. The faux dispute over the most recent proposal ignores the realities of this administration\u0027s legal logic and leaves its endless war mentality intact. The job description for 2016 hopefuls may as well read \"No Limits.\"Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveAs Valentine\u0027s Day approaches, our thoughts turn to romance. Unfortunately, many of our cultural myths about love, from fairy tales to rom coms, paint a very distorted picture.

Instead it\u0027s something we need with us every step of the way.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachThe tragic shooting of three young university students at UNC Chapel Hill yesterday could have been adopted by the media as yet another indictment of the rampant gun culture in the United States.Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University; Author, \u0027A Universe From Nothing\u0027I asked myself what I would want my friends to do when I go and I\u0027ll put those few of you on notice now: I want more than a tweet. So here is a moment for David Carr.Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Do all sons want to be \"better\" than their fathers? Do all fathers want the same for their sons -- that they grow to be \"better\" -- or do they secretly, perhaps unconsciously, always want to be someone their sons can look up to in every which way?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarPresident Obama is absolutely correct that our nation must confront these ruthless terrorists. But he was also correct to promise that America would not be sending U.S. combat troops back to the Middle East to fight another ground war.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteePresident Obama\u0027s remarks, last week, at the annual National Prayer Breakfast were theologically sound and politically smart. In spite of this, his comments set off a storm of criticism from conservative critics who took him to task for both his theology and his politics.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027For me, he represented the idea that writing could still be informed and provocative -- even about things like the media, especially about things like the media. He represented to me that quality still matters.Freelance writer and editorMarking, celebrating and memorializing the beautiful lives of Deah, Yuzor and Razan is, in addition to whatever comfort and solace it can bring the aggrieved, an opportunity for all of us who didn\u0027t know them to reflect on how we ourselves might be better people.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillTo be the guest of a great lord in his castle was an honor reserved for notable visitors known to the host, but others would arrive with a letter of introduction from the king or queen or a member of their family or friends of the host.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.The anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States isn\u0027t just rising, it\u0027s really high. An unwillingness and indifference on the part of individuals and institutions to put it in check is a large part of the problem.Executive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityIn the not-so-distant future (despite your protests), your attentions will turn toward finding your life partners. Since it\u0027s Valentine\u0027s Day -- and the focus is romantic love -- I want you to be very clear on what romantic love is not:Psychotherapist, AuthorIf you want to find out the best place to be on any day of the year--today, tomorrow, your birthday or wedding anniversary--check out our interactive calendar.Lonely Planet is the world\u0027s leading travel content provider, empowering people with the tools and knowledge they need to get to the heart of a place since 1973.While LeBron James and Kevin Durant might be some of the biggest success stories out of the league, perhaps it\u0027s time to pause and celebrate the league itself for its efforts to create a more inclusive environment for LBGT players and fans.Division I wrestling coach, Columbia University; founder and executive director, Athlete AllyIn the 17 days since the Greek national elections brought Alexis Tsipras and his SYRIZA party to power, the Eurocrisis has once again taken center stage, threatening not just the future of the unified currency and the European ideal, but also global economic and strategic stability.Chairman, Financial Crisis Inquiry CommissionBEIRUT -- ISIS\u0027 horrific immolation of a caged Lt. Muath Al-Kaseasbeh, the Jordanian pilot, will have been done in full understanding of the emotional impact of the manner of his death on Jordanians and in the West: This was very deliberate -- not some spur-of-the-moment act of barbarism.

MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027Why are so many girls, especially girls of color, confined in our nation\u0027s detention facilities, and what are we as a society going to do about it? We must all work tirelessly to give hope and a fair chance to these girls and all children by promoting policies, programs, and supports that help them and their families, especially those most at risk.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn terms of playing to the public\u0027s softer side, we might understand the logic behind a visual strategy of bringing the kids. But when you really look at it, the optic of family values just doesn\u0027t mix well with the optic of gun rights advocacy.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesThe summer deadline is approaching for finalizing the Environmental Protection Agency\u0027s first-ever limits on dangerous carbon pollution from the nation\u0027s power plants, and opponents are ratcheting up their complaints.Director, NRDC Climate and Clean Air ProgramEating healthy is certainly not about being perfect.

Until one day...Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostPresident Obama\u0027s proposal to repeal of the 2002 AUMF, which I have long fought for, is a positive sign, but we must address the root of the problem.
