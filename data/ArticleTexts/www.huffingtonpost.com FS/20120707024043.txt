{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesPayrolls grew by 80,000 last month and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 8.2% in a jobs report that confirms the slower trend in employment gains that showed up a few months ago. In order to get a better feel for the underlying trend, it\u0027s useful to average across a few months. With today\u0027s report, we now have job data for the second quarter of the year -- such quarterly numbers are less noisy and thus more reliable than the monthly ones. I\u0027m inclined to believe that we\u0027ve actually settled into a slower trend, and that is really not where we need to be right now. The slowdown is apparent across many industries, including manufacturing, which added 11,000 in June, but averaged 10,000 per month in the second quarter compared to 41,000 in the first. Even so, continued job gains of even small magnitudes in our factory sector are extremely welcome.Read Post | Comments (196)Gary Hart, 07/06/12President, Hart International, Ltd.There is a special place in hell, wrote the immortal Dante, for those who, in times of moral crisis, preserve their neutrality.
