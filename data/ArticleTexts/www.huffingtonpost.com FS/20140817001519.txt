{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"lincolnmitchell.comAs Obama\u0027s presidency winds down, one of the stranger stories to emerge has been the impeachment -- or, more accurately, the Republicans threatening impeachment but not really meaning it -- saga. Impeaching a president is difficult, as it requires a vote by the House of Representatives followed by a trial and vote by the Senate. Two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, have been impeached. Neither were convicted by the Senate. As long as the Democrats retain control of the Senate, or have close to 50 votes there, it is almost certain that efforts to impeach Obama would lead to the same result. While it may be reassuring to some to recognize that the likelihood of President Obama being impeached and convicted is extremely small, the possibility of his impeachment and the way it has been raised by some Republicans in Congress as more or less another legislative tool is concerning.The shooting death of Michael Brown and the death of countless and nameless others, remind me of my days growing up in the Arkansas delta in the 1950s and 1960s, and the warnings from my mother about not giving \"the law\" a reason to arrest or worse yet, shoot us.Higher Education Expert and ConsultantWith Nouri al-Maliki agreeing to step aside, Iraq may have passed its first hurdle on the way to forming the kind of government that will be needed to defeat the Islamic State (IS).

My dad never questioned that I would grow up to be his equal, to be the equal of my brothers.
