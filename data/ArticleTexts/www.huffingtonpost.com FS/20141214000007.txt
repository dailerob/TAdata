{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, historian, authorAbsent any criminal prosecutions, the only conclusion we will be left with is that these guys really are \"patriots\" and torturing people really is \"who we are.\" The morality and ethics of whether or not the CIA can torture people in our name are non-negotiable. There is no argument that can be made to justify this atrocity. The corporate media are treating torture as if it\u0027s just another \"issue\" like immigration reform or the federal budget. It isn\u0027t. You cannot justify the unjustifiable. People who attempt to apologize for torture done in their name are embarrassing themselves; raising their heads to be counted as barbarians at the gate. We don\u0027t fight against terrorists to become more like them, but to maintain our differences.The truth is that torture did work, but not the way its defenders claim. It worked to produce justifications for policies the establishment wanted, like the Iraq war.Communications director, Institute for Public AccuracyLet\u0027s cut the talk of fundamental American values that the rest of the world should admire. Obama may not want to dwell on the past, but history will, and his legacy on torture will be one of acceptance.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveElizabeth Warren represents a new politics in which, by challenging the power of the oligarchy, she has the potential of reclaiming the white working class for Democrats and uniting them with the coalition of professionals, single women, gays and minorities who elected Obama.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistThe life of a cancer patient can be summed up in one word: access. Everybody wants access to you. Whether it\u0027s the lab tech taking your blood or the chemo staff giving you an infusion, there are lots of \"ins and outs\" when you have cancer. You\u0027ll get used to it.Reimagine.me columnist and Professional Cancer SurvivorTrue, the CRomnibus, the nickname of the bill to fund the federal government through next September, runs to over 1,600 pages. But I suspect most readers will associate the \"m\" word with massive amounts of government spending, and that\u0027s just plain wrong.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAsk anyone who has been out of work for an extended period of time, and you will surely hear that being unemployed is far more difficult than what their last job actually demanded of them.Managing Partner Veteran RecruitingI first met Eric Holder during the Clinton years when he was serving as Deputy Attorney General. Back then, my community was deeply troubled by FBI harassment, the government\u0027s use of \"secret evidence\" to detain individuals and profiling of Muslim or Arab-looking individuals at airports around the country.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027We\u0027re nearing New Year\u0027s resolutions. Go ahead and resolve to lose weight but then ask yourself what that has to do with living a good life for you. Does it mean better health, looking better, feeling better about yourself? Dig deeper into your resolutions and you\u0027ll find your list of what makes for a good life now.Director of New York Public Programs for the Aspen InstituteWe acted identically, however, our narratives sharply diverged. Ironically so, as this treatment only underscored the unfortunate truth we had taken to the streets to protest: black and white bodies are not treated equally.First-year Master of Divinity student at Union Theological SeminaryThird-year Master of Divinity student at Union Theological SeminaryAs long as we are committed to this senseless War on Terror, the CIA will be asked by Presidents to do dark deeds. And to keep those deeds dark, so we can avoid facing up to \"what kind of people\" we are becoming.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyDesigning environments for seniors to age in place is an important part of the benefits communities can provide for individuals in the 21st century. And everyone -- across all generations -- will benefit from this emphasis on promoting better health across the life cycle.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralConsider these the early slush of the coming Republican winter, the first returns on investment for their donors. Tucked into the 1,603-page bill to fund the government -- that no legislator will read -- are cankerous riders, foreshadowing what is to come.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureEarlier this week I learned that a story that had run on HuffPost Parents had left one of our readers a bit upset. The post was entitled \"20 Kids\u0027 Names That Most Often Appear On The \u0027Naughty\u0027 List,\" and the reader was a 7-year-old girl named Ella -- which also happened to be the number-one name on the \"naughty\" list.If you truly want the best relationship possible, don\u0027t leave the fate of your \"happily in love\" connection to luck or chance.Our mission is to help people love their best.The Civil Rights Movement was itself the fruit of the shared spiritual yearnings of blacks and Indians. Therefore, South Asian immigrants are under historical, moral and spiritual obligations to refuse offers of white privilege and join in solidarity with African-Americans.Author, \u0027The Immanent Divine: God, Creation and the Human Predicament\u0027The United States cannot lead the world if it condones the use of torture. It is unclear why the patriots who led the U.S. government and the CIA through the trauma of 9/11 and its immediate aftermath fail to recognize this.Associate Professor of the Practice, Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, Director, Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland SecuritySome of the foods listed in here may be brand new to you and some may be foods you\u0027ve eaten for years. One thing is certain though: regardless of how new, old or trendy these foods may become in the next year, all of them will help to improve your health. After all, good health is a trend that never goes out of style.Manager of Wellness Nutrition Services at Cleveland Clinic Wellness InstituteOf course, we sincerely hope that you never need to use our list of helpful tips. But if you do find yourself needing to report a sexual assault some day, perhaps the list will come in handy -- at least as handy as all of the terrible how-to-not-get-raped advice that we\u0027ve all been given lately.Writer \u0026 AttorneyCo-Founder, End Rape On CampusHow long will you have to wait for book two? And once that comes out, what about book three? How will the series end? Will you have invested a ton of time (and serious feels) into a series, only to be given an ending that leaves you disappointed?Author, Social Media Manager at Quirk Books2014 was full of Hollywood stars behaving oddly (See Shia LaBeouf and Amanda Bynes) and loads of fake viral videos. But this year saw fabrication with dead-serious ripple effects as well. Here are the prevaricators who rose to the top of the LieSpotting list this year:Founder and CEO, CalibrateMany white Americans tend to see this problem as unfortunate incidents based on individual circumstances. Black Americans see a system in which their black lives matter less than white lives. The question is: Are we white people going to listen or not?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersSomeday Russians will be free. Not just from Communism, but also less forms of authoritarianism. Liberation will come only through the Russian people\u0027s own efforts, however, not from the West. Only they can make their own future. The day liberty arrives will be the real Russian Revolution.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteOn December 10th President Obama hosted a White House Summit on Early Education, bringing together a broad coalition of philanthropic, business, education, child advocacy and elected leaders and other key stakeholders.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundHowever, while it\u0027s easy to lament to the failings of our sports fandoms in 2014, there\u0027s no denying that there was also a lot of good to come from the past year.Editorial Fellow, Huffington PostWe now must shift our focus from reaction and responding to planning and preparing. Only then will our health investments lead to real gains in the health of all people regardless of their income or nationality.President of the Rockefeller FoundationPresident, World Bank GroupLet us suppose that somewhere there may be a valid reason, in spite of twenty-plus alleged victims, for which one refuses to believe Bill Cosby has ever harmed a woman -- conspiracy is simply not one of them.Chicago native. DC resident. Tulane University Alum. Passionate about social change and public policy.They are the hurtful whispers in my head when I\u0027m standing in front of the mirror naked. The thoughts and insecurities when I\u0027m in bed with my husband. These are some of my most painful and embarrassing memories.Writer/Blogger, piganddac.comThe threat of climate change is screaming at us. We must approach this global threat with the urgency that it warrants. We must work together, rich nations and developing nations as well, to avoid the instability and vulnerability that will surely befall us if we fail to heed the warning on climate change.U.S. Secretary of StateFor the next two years we will see Republicans do everything they can to deliver for corporate America at the expense of the American people. The only question is whether Democrats will enable them. Will President Obama continue to make compromise after compromise?Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027Twelve years ago, following my husband\u0027s surprise announcement that he was leaving our 22-year marriage to move across the country with a former stripper, I had to learn to navigate a strange new world.Writer, speaker and blogger at leegaitan.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"THOUSANDS MASS IN NYC",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
