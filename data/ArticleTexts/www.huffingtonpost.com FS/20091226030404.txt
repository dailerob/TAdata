{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOTime for my annual tradition of getting gifts for my favorite -- and not so favorite -- public figures. This year, I\u0027m getting Joe Lieberman a DVD of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington so he can see the proper use of a filibuster -- to fight corruption, not promote it.

We\u0027ll collect the best ones and unwrap them on Christmas Day.Read Post | Comments (348)BIOTrey Ellis, 12.23.2009Novelist, Screenwriter, and Assistant Professor at Columbia UniversityI wish all of you the best Christmas ever.
