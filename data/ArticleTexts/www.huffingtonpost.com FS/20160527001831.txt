{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressEvery four years, as Democrats and Republicans plan for their national conventions, party leaders come together to decide on how to best dust off and shine up their respective parties’ platform — that catch-all proclamation that signals their political priorities and policy goals. Typically, the publication of these platforms results in a couple days of news stories, in which noteworthy alterations are documented and the other side levies partisan objections.

But unlike some of his other falsehoods, the media has left this one unchallenged.Junior Scientist, Institute for Community Health; Instructor of Medicine, Harvard Medical SchoolCo-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramThe EU referendum will be one of the most significant decisions British citizens will ever have to make. The outcome will affect how the UK is governed, national security, the economy, human rights, the environment, culture... every aspect of our lives.

But they probably saved mine.Founding Chairman, Business Executives for National SecurityHillary offers effective ways to reduce the growing economic gaps that matter most to lower and middle income families - and she has also attracted the broadest support from working Americans of modest means.Victor S. Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology and formerly Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard UniversityDonald Trump claims he \"is not a big believer in global warming\" because the warnings are \"a total hoax\" and \"bullshit\" based on \"pseudoscience.\" Thus dismissing the knowledge, experience and data of 2,000 scientists from 154 countries.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in neurophysiologyThe Grand Canyon, brought to you by Budweiser.
