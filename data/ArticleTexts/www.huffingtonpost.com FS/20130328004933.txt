{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt is always risky to predict what the Supreme Court will do in a case based on the oral argument. Justices ask questions of the lawyers for a variety of reasons and the questions do not always reveal what the justices are actually thinking. Some questions, for example, are genuinely designed to help a justice think through the logic of the advocate\u0027s argument, whereas others are intended to demonstrate weaknesses in the advocate\u0027s position in an effort to \"educate\" other justices. Knowing exactly what is motivating any particular question is a tricky business and prognosticators often misjudge what\u0027s really going on. Having offered this caveat, let me now offer my own predictions about Perry and Windsor.Comments (24)David FontanaAssociate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.Where the country stands on gay marriage in the future might be a foregone conclusion. But what federal and state legislatures do about this is far from a foregone conclusion. As a result, a punt by the Court might mean that gay marriage supporters will have to wait a very long time to get the ball and the momentum back.Comments (91)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationMalala Yousafzai and her father Ziauddin are the first two signatories of the petition to the Pakistani President following the assassination of Shahnaz Nazli yesterday. Shahnaz was a courageous teacher who joins a list of pupils and teachers shot because they wanted girls to be able to go to school and learn.Comments (89)Rev. Emily C. HeathClergy, United Church of ChristHere is how a clergyperson stops a wedding from occurring in their church: they say \"no\".Comments (561)Arianna HuffingtonI found Disconnect incredibly compelling -- a perfect use of storytelling to vividly dramatize an issue that permeates our lives to such an extent that it\u0027s hard to even see.Comments (192)Emma Gray and Margaret Wheeler JohnsonThe volume of stories about Kardashian\u0027s body and what headlines say about it remind us how acceptable it has become to talk publicly about an individual woman\u0027s appearance in terrible ways.Comments (506)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThey share similar names. They all promise prosperity. Nobody, after all, is going to label their budget \"the route to yet more unemployment.\" In truth, however, these are not just different budgets. They are entirely different route-maps to our collective future.Comments (127)Judy MartinBroadcast journalist; Founder, WorkLifeNation.comWith employees working long hours -- their shoulders hunched over computers and checking email at lightening speed -- it\u0027s no wonder many don\u0027t take the time to breathe. But breathing is more important than ever before.Comments (11)Paul HogarthManaging Editor, Beyond ChronIt is never wise to predict U.S. Supreme Court decisions on oral arguments, or else Obamacare would have been repealed. Based on the Justices\u0027 line of questioning, however, it appears that they will overrule Proposition 8 -- but on narrow grounds that will only affect California.Comments (33)Valerie BaberAuthor \u0026 Sex JournalistSex was only something I did for a living. It didn\u0027t define me and I resented that people passed judgment about my character based solely off topless photos on the Internet.Comments (94)Jim WallisChristian leader for social changeWe need to establish a firm principle: the abuse of women by men will no longer be tolerated by other men. The voices of more men need to make that perfectly clear. For boys, for young athletes, and for fathers, Steubenville should become a wake-up call.Comments (861)Dr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistUnderstanding more about how sleep affects genetic function holds great promise in illuminating these pathways and could open important new avenues for both treatment and prevention of illness and disease.CommentsMeg BuckLife CoachI married my first love when I was 22. We\u0027d been together for four years and I was having his baby, so it seemed like the right thing to do. It turns out that I was wrong -- we ended up getting divorced after less than a year of marriage. Here\u0027s what I learned from the experience.Comments (141)Michael S. LofgrenFormer Congressional Staffer, author of The Party is Over: How Republicans Went Crazy, Democrats Became Useless, and the Middle Class Got ShaftedIn its refined form, crackpot realism wears the camouflage of idealism: military invasions are really aimed at humanitarian rescue, spreading democracy, or peacekeeping.CommentsSonkita Conteh and Vivek MaruWhen President Koroma of Sierra Leone visits Washington this Thursday, President Obama will rightly praise his counterpart for a decade of democracy, and for recovering from a devastating civil war. But Sierra Leone\u0027s progress is precarious.CommentsLeanna CossmanNurse and motherPeople accept an 8-year-old who still acts 6. They are just \"young for their age.\" They will tolerate a 10-year-old who still acts 6 if the parent looks exhausted enough. But a 13-year-old who is still acting like a 6-year-old is a serious social problem. I know, because this child is my son.Comments (26)Cameron FryeWriterI slept with a married guy. I wish I could say this was a one-time thing, but it\u0027s not the first time I\u0027ve been the other woman.Comments (38)Jennifer BlastorahHistorian and Kindergarten TeacherAfter returning to Canada in autumn of 2011, the competition was staggering. I quickly lowered my standards. I applied for non-paid internships. I applied for reception work at small offices. I even added my resume to the Starbucks roster. After seven months, I never had a single interview.Comments (77)Kristen HoughtonAuthor of \u0027No Woman Diets Alone\u0027 and \u0027And Then I\u0027ll Be Happy! Stop Sabotaging Your Happiness\u0027Men not only in Italy but in all of Europe and Latin American countries appreciate the woman who has a little \u0027mileage\u0027 on her. Like a well-preserved vintage car, a good piece of 18k gold jewelry, or a fine patina on a silver tea service, women who have lived are a premium in other countries.Comments (47)Jonathan RauchGuest scholar, Brookings InstitutionListening to the Supreme Court\u0027s arguments on the big gay marriage case -- which will decide if California, or for that matter any other state, can forbid same-sex marriage, as California\u0027s Proposition 8 did in 2008 -- I was struck by the baldly political nature of the conversation.Comments (77)Peter DiamandisChairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationWe know crowds can raise billions of dollars, create Wikipedia, and even design and build small autonomous drones. But how about something large and complex like designing a new car, and maybe someday even a spaceship?CommentsAnu KumarExecutive Vice President, IpasI wholeheartedly stand with gay Americans in this movement. I hope the Supreme Court rules in favor of gay marriage and that financial equality for gay families can be achieved. I support unequivocally the sexual and reproductive rights of all people. But when will it be our turn?Comments (16)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen I went on Phil Donahue\u0027s talk show in 1977, the handsome host knocked me for a loop. In the green room beforehand, he told me he wanted to talk to me about my mother (no one ever wanted to talk about my mother -- just my famous father), so I immediately knew there was something ... different about this guy.Comments (121)Courtney ScottSenior Editor at TravelocityThe beauty of Italy is that every town -- even the tiniest village -- has its own individual identity; its own specialty products, dialects and customs, which makes roaming off the Italian tourist map even more addicting.CommentsTasha Gordon-SolmonPlaywrightIt\u0027s a song about drowning at sea. It\u0027s a song about a hair accessory- and its quest for independence. It\u0027s a song about the new pope.Comments (19)Heather Layton and Brian BaileyWhat would drone strikes look like if we were the targets rather than unknown people in a place too distant to imagine?Comments (13)Jacob CombsEditor, EqualityOnTrial.comI just walked out of oral arguments at the U.S. Supreme Court. It was a whirlwind hearing, and all three lawyers faced tough questions from the justices. Here\u0027s my initial take on the justices\u0027 questions and what they might mean.Comments (367)Dr. Anne Fausto-SterlingBiology professor, Brown UniversityI don\u0027t want to slow down the engine that is promoting improved access for girls and women in science and technology. But Stoet and Geary\u0027s data actually beg for answers about educating the low achievers.Comments (15)Zack ExleyVenture AnachronistA bold, practical-and-radical politics is waiting to introduce itself to the American people. Once it does, millions of dollars in small donations, and an army of volunteers, then many respected establishment figures, think tanks, corporations and other organizations will join us.Comments (290)Anne TheriaultFeminist blogger\"4. Assume that there is no one out there keeping a tally of all of your failings, ready to throw it in your face when you\u0027re either feeling too good or too awful about yourself.\"Comments (35)Elizabeth B. WydraChief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterIt may have taken us 100 years to get it right with respect to race-restrictions on the freedom to marry, but it doesn\u0027t mean those laws weren\u0027t unconstitutional in 1868. The same is true, nearly 150 years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, for laws that deny gay and lesbian couples the freedom to marry.Comments (162)Ming-Te Wang, 2013.27.03Chris Weigant, 2013.27.03Jacob Combs, 2013.27.03Andy Schupak, 2013.27.03Molly Lindquist, 2013.27.03Christine Carter, PhD, 2013.27.03Ben Teller, 2013.27.03David Hazony, 2013.27.03Robert Slayton, 2013.27.03Dr. Brian C.
