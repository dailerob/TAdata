{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorThe Republican Presidential race is unhinged by international events, as well as by President Obama\u0027s staying power. None is a credible leader for the nation. The only candidate who has offered a robust, nuanced and thoughtful strategy for dealing with ISIS is Hillary Clinton, but whether she might actually become Commander-in-Chief we won\u0027t know until next November\u0027s election. Barack Obama is president for one more year. He has responded calmly to the rush of recent events, and not let calls for World War stampede him into hasty moves. For a man who receive the Nobel Peace Prize in his first year in office, Obama has had to spend a lot of his time deciding on military actions.We are all children of God (or nature or whatever you believe in), part of the human family, and nothing you say or do can change that fact one iota.

Our country\u0027s legislators reached across the aisle and passed a landmark bill that will increase the federal funding of Alzheimer\u0027s research by $350 million next year.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and leading Alzheimer’s advocateFor 40 years, Republicans and some Democrats have been demanding an end to the ban on crude oil exports.

Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.So far this year, Americans have been more likely to be killed for being Muslim -- than by a Muslim. For many Americans, however, statistics don\u0027t seem to matter. They are so fixated on one form of violence -- Islamic terrorism -- that they do not notice how rare it is.Professor of Sociology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Co-director, Carolina Center for the Study of the Middle East and Muslim CivilizationsWhen I heard President Hollande mention the critical goal of 1.5°C I knew this would be a different COP. He was the first world leader from a developed country to utter the ceiling of 1.5°C. And the world took notice.Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation\"[On] a normal day, we see massacres and a lot of airstrikes,\" one man said, speaking in Arabic. \"What has become not normal ... is if you don\u0027t hear any attacks, if you don\u0027t hear bullets being fired, if you don\u0027t see any signs of war -- this is something we\u0027re not used to. We\u0027ve become used to war.\"Blog Editor, The Huffington PostBernie, if you win without creating an organized movement, then your efforts as president will likely be stymied by the power of the Washington and Wall Street elites, and many of your supporters will sink back into disillusionment and alienation.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistImportantly, the study defined \"autism\" as a medical service claim or hospital code for autism or several related diagnoses. When the authors looked only at cases of autism that were confirmed by psychiatrists, link with antidepressants was no longer statistically significant.High risk obstetrician, aspiring midwife, breastfeeding researcher and advocate, mom of three.Starbucks has a bigger problem than the controversy over its new red holiday cup. It\u0027s still buying palm oil and other agricultural products that might be linked to tropical forest destruction, and a coalition of science, environmental and labor organizations isn\u0027t happy about it.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsIn all the talk about the Venezuelan government\u0027s alleged \"repressiveness,\" there has been little to no discussion of its neighbor, and close U.S. ally, Colombia, whose military admittedly killed over 5,000 of its own civilians and claimed they were guerillas in order to justify the continued massive military support from the U.S.Human \u0026 Labor Rights Lawyer, Adjunct Professor of International Human Rights LawFor those who voluntarily join from abroad, ISIS is a joyful revolutionary movement bonded in blood.Director of Research in Anthropology at France\u0027s National Center of Scientific ResearchTo ensure all families have access to care when and where they need it, we need more care providers. The first step to building a stable workforce is to make caregiving jobs good jobs, with higher wages and benefits.NurseSorry, well-meaning Actually Man, but I don\u0027t need your input. These dudes\u0027 self-assuredness is hilarious to me. They show up guns blazing to a battle I\u0027ve already been in for my entire life. It turns out that these men telling me to \"man up\" are just so incredibly fragile and sad.Comedian, writer, producerSoledad Barrio is a force of nature in Noche Flamenca\u0027s Antigona. Her arms are as liquid as any Russian Prima Swan Queen, her feet unimaginably swift and precise. But it is her soul that is on display here more than anything.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnThe most abused cliche in politics is the concept of \u0027change,\u0027 yet a young movement among academics and techno-scientists seeks to overhaul the current system with a computerized, politician-minimal alternative. Algorithmic governance is a radical, digital reimagining of government centred on computerized processes. Algorithms -- which already have many applications like sorting incoming emails and controlling traffic lights -- would be unified to create a governing network. Algorithmic government may sound far-fetched, but it is already happening in smaller, more localized ways.Toronto-based musician and producer.Drugs are a part of life, but the way we talk about drugs in our society is hugely problematic. We make distinctions based on a drug\u0027s legal status, and most people never question why only certain drugs are illegal.Manager of Social Media and Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceMany commentators have said since Saturday that this agreement is not enough. No climate negotiator would disagree with that. But this agreement contains everything it reasonably could to pull our emissions curve downward as fast as humanly possible.Climate advisor, Independent DiplomatWe must end the criminalization of all people who work in the sex trade in order to end this violence. Laws punishing people who engage in sex work serve only to worsen the violence and economic hardships of transgender people already struggling to survive.Director of the Trans/Gender Non-Conforming Justice Project of the National LGBTQ Task ForceAs a Black-American in the Muslim community, I have observed and been subjected to racism and micro-aggressions that exists among non-black Muslim populations perpetrated on one another and the Black community.Muslim, African-American, Interfaith Presenter, Blogger, Seeker of Truth, Promoting Consciousness, Driven by Intuition, Tar Heel Born and BredOne of my favorite posters at Facebook says, \"Nothing At Facebook Is Someone Else\u0027s Problem.\" The inequities that persist are everyone\u0027s problem -- gender inequality harms men and women, racism hurts whites and minorities, and equal opportunity benefits us all.The best answer to any questionIt\u0027s much easier to fear and hate the unknown, so we wanted to be sure that we were known as your Muslim neighbors -- not because we think it should matter, but because we think it shouldn\u0027t.Author, Attorney, Activist, UN Global ExpertWith this year\u0027s candidates professing primarily Judeo-Christian traditions, we at the Opportunity Agenda believe it\u0027s important to ascertain how consistent the candidates\u0027 stated positions are with the faiths they espouse.Senior Fellow, The Opportunity AgendaFor more than a year, U.S. drones flying out of Djibouti waged a secret war against the Islamic State. For more than a year, it went unreported on the nightly news, in the country\u0027s flagship newspapers, or evidently anywhere else.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comThe fact that the newest Star Wars film, directed by JJ Abrams, has casted an even more diverse and inclusive set of leaders for the film only serves to elevate the timelessness of the message of \"The Force\" as an agent for social change.President and CEO, The California EndowmentAs the primary season quickly approaches, it is clear that the women of America could decide this election. Most probably, the choice will be between electing the first woman president, who happens to be the most experienced and competent of all candidates, or Donald Trump.Lawyer/international trade consultant specializing in the Middle East, former senior government official and law professorThe time has come for Congress -- Republican and Democratic members alike -- to investigate why one multi-billion dollar company is having such a devastating impact on jobs and our trade deficits.Communications Director for Making Change at WalmartSo for you, I bring you a few words of encouragement in hopes to convince you to step out of your comfort zone, and take a few risks in life - to get you closer to living the life of your dreams.Travel + lifestyle photojournalist and founder of projectinspo.comIf you are looking for unique, last-minute gifts, try adding a handmade touch and DIY-ing something special.
