{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027A happy Labor Day to all -- a day for a last summer outing to the beach, a three-day weekend to shop the sales, or maybe just a day to stay home and get ready for the school year. And, oh yeah, a day to honor working people. As Labor Day weekend approached, fast food workers in at least 50 cities went on one-day strikes to demand a living wage. One double-edged analogy that comes to mind is the Occupy movement. It created a venue to confront the chasms of inequality in American society and the power of Wall Street. But what Occupy did not do was to translate into a durable politics that led to real reform. That\u0027s what the fast food movement needs to do.Comments (181)Jan SchakowskyMember of Congress, 9th District of IllinoisThe real Welfare Kings are the Fast Food Giants and all those poverty wage employers who refuse to pay a livable wage. They depend on the taxpayer-funded government programs to subsidize their employees. It\u0027s the Wal-Marts and McDonald\u0027s that need those welfare programs. They are the Takers, not the Makers.Comments (629)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorThe best way to remember Martin Luther King is not to think of him as a statue or an icon, but to take to heart his example. He said no. He resisted. He said, we will not acquiesce to what we know is wrong. How does that apply to the situation of public education today?Comments (325)Norman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027Hell hath no fury like war-makers scorned. Simmering rage will be palpable from political elites who do not want to see Congress set an unprecedented precedent: thwarting the will of a president who wants Pentagon firepower unleashed on another country.Comments (688)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerFor the HuffPost community to grow and develop we must emphasize fairness in access, promote civil discourse, reduce vitriol on our pages and provide a defense against trolling. A key strategy in doing all of this is our plan to require all new members to identify themselves when they create an account.Comments (1,778)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostOnce he had Jesse in his clutches, Hank became Walter White.Comments (308)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersHistory will judge us harshly, if we stand by idly, and legitimate the use of chemical weapons -- and weapons of mass destruction in general -- by allowing their use in the view of the full world to go unpunished.Comments (503)Christine OwensExecutive Director of the National Employment Law ProjectAh... Labor Day -- one last chance to throw a burger on the grill and take our minds off work. Not usually a day people spend contemplating workers in America. If most of us really stopped to think about the state of workers on Labor Day, we would be in no mood to celebrate.Comments (296)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027Perhaps it is solidarity with the victims of Damascus that has caused Hollande and France to voice their determination, and now to assume a leading role. As if to declare, \u0027We know, we have been there, it can not be permitted to happen again.\"Comments (49)Michael BruneExecutive Director, The Sierra ClubThis Labor Day, the Sierra Club joins in celebrating working people everywhere. If we want to help working families, protect our air and water, and achieve justice for all Americans, we must first defend our democracy.CommentsMelissa SherWriter and blogger, Mammalingo.comLittle kids. They\u0027re sticky. They drip a lot. And they mess up our stuff. But we wouldn\u0027t trade them for anything in the world. We can\u0027t. We\u0027re actually not allowed. Most countries have very strict laws against it. So, since they\u0027re still ours for the next 18 or so years, let\u0027s learn from them.Comments (26)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsSteven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolPresident Obama\u0027s proposed limited air attack on the Assad regime, with no boots on the ground, is the least bad choice. But whatever the result, the U.S. should avoid getting drawn into a land war in Syria.Comments (76)Jim SleeperLecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityopenDemocracy.net, one of Britain\u0027s most thoughtful, respected websites, has just posted more of the truth about university-regime collaborations and their implications for U.S. foreign policy.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comRather than discussing the pros and cons of striking Syria today, we have to point out something which should be glaringly obvious -- that Congress will be continuing their fifth week of vacation rather than returning to Washington to vote on whether America should go to war.CommentsMike AdamickStay-at-home dadCourage is 7. She wears tan jodhpurs and a blue coat, and she rides a bowy, knock-knee pony with a wild forelock and a white blaze.CommentsJonathan D. LovitzPublic speakerYou know you know gay people. You realize by now that they\u0027re all around. You\u0027ve been on baseball teams and in locker rooms and rushed frats together. We, as the impossible to define bunch known as Gen-Y, have become increasingly cool with our gay brothers and friends.Comments (430)Christopher ElliottAuthor, How to Be the World\u0027s Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle)For years, travelers suspected online agencies of serving up higher fares and prices when they recognized your browser \"cookies\" -- those invisible electronic breadcrumbs that identify you.Comments (19)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersConnected by the vital need to improve the lot of America\u0027s middle class, workers in solidarity shall overcome threats to their right to collectively bargain for better wages, safer working conditions and decent benefits.Comments (34)Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityAt a time when ambitious business-school professors and salivating entrepreneurs predict the end of the university as we know it, and at a time when we have never been more in need of an educated workforce and citizenry, the task of understanding the evolving mission and performance of American higher education has never been more urgent.Comments (22)Christian PiattAuthor, editor, speakerHere\u0027s a list of handy phrases to help bring followers of Jesus into a post-Christendom, 21st-century world.Comments (587)Diane GottsmanNational etiquette and modern manners expert; Owner, The Protocol School of TexasEvery relationship has a season, some lasting a lifetime while others are meant to be only short term. It doesn\u0027t mean that they were not valuable relationships, only that you learned what you were supposed to learn, helped who you were supposed to help, and gained a lesson along the way.CommentsJerry LansonJournalism professor, Emerson CollegeEmployees walked out of about 1,000 restaurant. Many earn the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage. They\u0027re demanding $15 an hour instead, contending, as one Los Angeles striker told The Times\u0027 Steven Greenhouse, that \"people can\u0027t survive on the minimum wage.\"Comments (348)Frida BerriganBoard member, War Resisters League; Columnist, Waging NonviolenceThis back-to-school season, the average U.S. household will spend $634.78 on apparel, shoes, supplies and electronics. My husband Patrick and I, however, did not keep up with the Joneses on this one and our credit rating thanks us for our miserliness.Comments (19)Joseph A. McCartinAssociate professor of history at Georgetown UniversityMany of those marching today might not realize that the very term \"living wage\" was first popularized by an American Roman Catholic priest, Monsignor John A. Ryan.Comments (252)Ken ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansIt\u0027s mind-boggling that at a time when overweight and obesity levels are sky high among our young people, and physical activity levels are down, our schools are cutting physical education classes, recess and intramural sports programs.Comments (126)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027It will not be easy to reconstitute the Syrian nation, to reconcile its people, and to heal the many wounds inflicted by this devastating war. But this, not revenge, must be the goal we seek -- for the sake of the region, for Syria and most especially for the Syrian people.Comments (186)Mike DunnProud Nutmegger, Univ. of Nebraska graduateIt\u0027s been described as a meltdown, but it really wasn\u0027t. At no point during Dave Chappelle\u0027s show at the Oddball Festival in Hartford was he ever anything other than in measured control of his actions. I was part of the audience at the show.Comments (202)Donna Rockwell, PsyDLicensed clinical psychologist, specialist in celebrity mental health, leading mindfulness meditation teacher, and activist in contemporary humanistic psychologyThirty-three years ago, Dan hired me as a 23-year-old straight out of journalism school -- surely the latest in a long-line of short-lived assistants. These were the first few days of the fledgling Cable News Network (CNN), June of 1980. Unlike his first attempts, Dan and I clicked.CommentsPaul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistComments (13)Shaila CallaghanChiropractorWhen worn up to 60 minutes per day, it can be understood why the relationship between heavy backpacks and back pain in children is a growing concern. Choosing the right backpack and taking the time to load it properly can make a difference in preventing injury to our children.Comments (12)Jeff Danziger, 2013. 2.09John W.
