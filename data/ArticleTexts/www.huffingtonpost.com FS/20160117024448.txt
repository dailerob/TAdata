{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorDear President Obama, I am writing this to you from the place where I was born -- Flint, Michigan. Please consider this personal appeal from me and the 102,000 citizens of the city of Flint who have been poisoned -- not by a mistake, not by a natural disaster, but by a governor and his administration who, to \"cut costs,\" took over the city of Flint from its duly elected leaders, unhooked the city from its fresh water supply of Lake Huron, and then made the people drink the toxic water from the Flint River.Wal-Mart headquarters announced January 15th that the company will close a total of 269 stores world-wide. This store implosion represents the end of the line for Wal-Mart\u0027s smallest format, the so-called Wal-Mart Express. It also reveals the giant retailer\u0027s over-saturation of American markets.Founder, Sprawl-BustersAfter a promising start, Clinton\u0027s campaign has taken an abrupt, confused, strategic turn. Recent polling suggests her rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, is not only ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, but is neck-and-neck, perhaps even ahead, in Iowa. That these early states are shaping up as competitive shouldn’t be a shock to anyone. Voters break late -- many aren\u0027t paying close attention until a few weeks before their state\u0027s contest. And yet, Clinton has responded to the adversity by doing, frankly, what Clintons always tend to do -- going on the attack. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as those attacks make sense in the context of a Democratic primary. What Clinton has come up with, however, is strategic madness.Editor, Eat the PressSenior Political Economy ReporterA woman in the White House won\u0027t solve all these problems, you say, and you\u0027re right. But I guarantee you women\u0027s concerns will move up on the national agenda from day one of a Hillary Clinton Administration.Member of Congress, 9th District of IllinoisFor one Bill Cosby, there are hundreds like him who will never be indicted. I think this way because I know it from experience. I have my own Bill Cosby tale to tell.Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics, The University of ChicagoThis prisoner release personifies the persistence and wisdom of the Obama administration\u0027s diplomatic efforts. This exchange is a direct result of the nuclear deal. It simply could not have happened without dialogue between the U.S. and Iran.Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilAs the president noted in his State of the Union, the fact that the tone of politics hasn\u0027t changed is one of his lasting regrets. But \"it takes two to tango\" and from the performance of Trump and company, the other side doesn\u0027t appear ready to end the state of our dis-union.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027What\u0027s been less noted is how the religious relight, another force behind Cruz, would have responded if it knew at the time that Cruz was taking a loan from a company that had helped make marriage equality a reality.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostWhen Obama took part in the recent CNN town hall on gun violence, he noted, \"There\u0027s nothing else in our lives that we purchase where we don\u0027t try to make it a little safer if we can.\" It\u0027s a fact that in the US, the federal government regulates every consumer product for health and safety, except for one: guns.Executive Director, Violence Policy CenterUnfortunately, Chelsea Clinton misrepresented Senator Sanders\u0027 position, and her premiere performance on the stump backfired, producing a flood of political donations to Sanders.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Most of us have experienced that sickening moment when you realize you\u0027ve made a serious mistake.

Mistakes and pressure are inevitable; the secret to getting past them is to stay calm.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.The battle over Yosemite Park\u0027s names isn\u0027t just about the famous Ahwahnee Hotel. Yes, it and the names of four other historic properties are part of the park\u0027s history. The Ahwahanee was named in 1927 and the Wawona Hotel was named in 1879. But it\u0027s really about corporate control of public goods.Executive Director, In the Public InterestLittle is more comforting on a cold winter day than a big bowl of hot soup or stew. From Pasta e Fagioli to Beef Bourgignon, these recipes will warm you and make you happy.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomThe story of my daughter Harper is that everybody\u0027s life, even if they have special needs, has a purpose.Mom, medical cannabis advocateThe idea of what religious freedom means is not a settled matter. But Clarkson offers a definition that allows progressives to reclaim religious liberty from conservative Christians who have perverted its meaning in service of theocratic agendas.Strategic communications consultant based in Washington, D.C.Black boys have an especially difficult time as they approach adulthood, and I sometimes feel helpless when I think about all of the tools you\u0027ll need to navigate the world. Remember that no matter where your life leads, I will always be your mother, your friend and your number one fan!CEO \u0026 FounderAfter years of tickling the dragon\u0027s tail, flirting with the demagoguery of America\u0027s right wing and egging on a growing rage within a core constituency of disaffected, working class white Americans, the dragon has started to breathe fire, and the flames have spread in all directions.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.We, like many of our constituents, have seen firsthand how this tragic epidemic has affected our own friends and loved ones, and by sharing their stories we hope to put a face to the addiction crisis.U.S. Representative, New Hampshire\u0027s second congressional districtBefore even being asked to comment again this year, the Blacademy spokesman whipped out a copy of last year\u0027s press release and highlighted: \"It\u0027s not that white actors weren\u0027t good, it\u0027s just that there were a lot of great performances by black actors this year.\"Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityWriter and filmmakerTo be clear: God is not finished with the Episcopal Church yet. We have miles to go and much work to do to overcome the many systemic issues that continue to challenge us as we strive to live into our call to be the Body of Christ in the world.Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.We can keep dirty coal in the ground and protect our public lands from mining and generate electricity with clean energy and give people better jobs. Thanks to today\u0027s announcement, we\u0027re that much closer to making it happen.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubWe are medical workers, teachers, rescue workers and civil society activists who, along with hundreds of thousands of others, are living under siege in Syria. What makes our suffering more painful is knowing that UN warehouses full of lifesaving aid are often just minutes away.A global advocacy group standing in solidarity with non-violent Syrians and their struggle for a peaceful and dignified future.Monday was an important day for America\u0027s shrinking middle class.

I suppose that, as the daughter of both a former U.S. president and a potential U.S. president, she is somewhat credible by association, but what does that truly net?Serial digital entrepreneur and short fiction writerLouisiana is extraordinary in that the primary source for public defense funding comes from fees defendants must pay if found guilty of a crime. That means public defenders can only guarantee their salary if enough of their clients are convicted of crimes. Acquittals are bad for business.Staff Attorney, ACLU\u0027s Criminal Law Reform ProjectNot all \"paid\" lawyers are good attorneys, and not all \"court-appointed\" lawyers and public defenders are bad. However, it is a sad but true fact, as Making A Murderer ably illustrates, that the quality of justice in this country directly correlates to the amount of resources a defendant has.Writer \u0026 LawyerNo one who has served our country should have to sleep on the streets - especially in our nation\u0027s capital. Soon, I know we will make that goal a reality.Laura Zeilinger is the director for the D.C.
