{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Nora Ephron is gone -- and I can\u0027t believe it. Whenever I was around her through the years the air crackled with energy and ideas and one-liners -- and a sense of celebration. That\u0027s what makes today\u0027s news so hard to take in. Nora was an integral part of the HuffPost family -- an investor, a supporter, and a constant sounding board months before we launched. Since then, she\u0027s been a contributing editor who more than lived up to her name -- regularly offering up notes, suggestions, and terrific ideas (our very popular Divorce section was one of them). Professionally, her legacy will be that of an exceptionally gifted and versatile artist who could do it all, and do it all incredibly well. Personally, she\u0027ll be cherished as a wife and mother, and a devoted, giving, treasured -- and irreplaceable -- friend. Indeed, she was as talented at friendship as she was at everything else she tried.Read Post | Comments (21)Lisa Belkin, 06/26/12Senior columnist for Life/Work/ Family, The Huffington PostWe felt Nora Ephron knew us, not because she was one of us, but because she was so much more, a distillation of what women felt but didn\u0027t yet know, or would have said if they\u0027d been clever enough. The quips the rest of us wished we\u0027d made, but didn\u0027t think of until the moment had passed? Ephron gave us voice.Read Post | CommentsLynda Resnick, 06/26/12Author, Rubies in the OrchardHer writing was flip and deep. She thought about things, everyday things, and then wrote about them in the most approachable way. Like \"Come on girls, we see this thing alike, don\u0027t we?\"Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 06/26/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupThe Newsroom is a paint-by-numbers Sorkin effort, given a frisson of media interest and buzz only because the workplace this time is the media itself. Nothing gets us going like someone we don\u0027t like preaching to us about our shortcomings.Read Post | Comments (49)Robert Reich, 06/26/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027When regressives talk about \"preserving and protecting\" the nation, be warned: They mean securing our borders, not securing our society. Within those borders, each of us is on our own. They don\u0027t want a government that actively works for all our citizens.Read Post | Comments (972)Sara Wilson, 06/26/12Senior Editor, HuffPost Weddings \u0026 HuffPost DivorceThat line about divorce encapsulated everything about Nora Ephron: how smart and funny and incisive was; how she possessed the world\u0027s most finely tuned bullshit detector; how she couldn\u0027t help but go straight to the heart of the matter.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 06/26/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistThere\u0027s a new hot TV mogul on the scene. She\u0027s brilliant, she\u0027s powerful, she\u0027s funny, and she\u0027s just 26-years-old. Talk about your wunderkinds.Read Post | Comments (68)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 06/26/12Author, Research Psychologist, Gender ScholarWith Obama enjoying as much as a 20 point lead with women, who many pundits say could be the key to the election, you\u0027d think the Romney would be a little more accommodating. But Romney\u0027s positions could not be clearer.Read Post | Comments (304)Mohamed A.

The second is that plus something far more dangerous.Read Post | Comments (15)Michelangelo Signorile, 06/26/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; SiriusXM radio hostTo actually endorse a candidate who calls for stripping you of rights seems totally crazy and pathological -- unless perhaps you don\u0027t believe the candidate will ever do such a thing. And that is actually what gay Republicans who are voting for Romney will tell you privately.Read Post | Comments (165)Brian Frederick, 06/26/12Executive Director, SportsFans.orgWhile most fans are celebrating the official announcement of a four-team playoff, keep in mind that college football remains firmly in the control of a cartel that cares more about protecting its own profits than fairly and equitably maximizing revenues for the benefit of all.Read Post | CommentsDevon Corneal, 06/25/12Lawyer, MotherBefore I became a parent, I would have sworn none of this ever would have happened. I\u0027m from the Northeast. We wear clothes. We do not wander about the house in our underwear... The idea of walking around half clothed in front of my kid? No thank you.Read Post | Comments (208)Joseph A. Palermo, 06/26/12Associate professor, historian, authorWe could learn a lot from the election of 1912 where a third and fourth party shook up the foundations of corporate control. It\u0027s a disgrace that 100 years ago the United States could run an election with far greater choices than it is capable of running today.Read Post | Comments (67)Lloyd I. Sederer, MD, 06/26/12Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthThe National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University released a report on addictions today that is remarkably comprehensive and even more remarkably honest in portraying the virtually utter failure to identify and effectively treat addiction in the U.S.Read Post | Comments (22)Robert Raben, 06/26/12Fmr. Assistant Attorney GeneralCongress is on track to find Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt. Given how contemptuous most Americans are of Congress, this week\u0027s mostly party line vote will be the political equivalent of the congressional pot calling the attorney general kettle, well, black.Read Post | Comments (144)Kirsten West Savali, 06/26/12Cultural critic, Screenwriter and Contributing Editor, Newsone.comContrary to popular belief, there are \"real\" black people in Atlanta who are not prestigious.

Because a great deal of the people with whom I\u0027d like to figure out how to be in ministry don\u0027t. They\u0027re not heathen.

These processes are long, conflictual, fraught with sudden leaps forward and discouraging retreats. But nothing says that things will not happen in Egypt at this dawn of the 21st century as they have in other great countries.Read Post | Comments (13)Chris Weigant, 06/25/12Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThis column series will examine the race between Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama in the only way that is useful for actually predicting its outcome: a state-by-state look at how each candidate is doing.
