{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDon’t let anyone tell you current gun safety regulations are working just fine. They aren’t. The massacre at Sandy Hook woke up many Americans to the epidemic of gun violence, which has snuffed out the lives of 148,000 children since 1968 -- this is the equivalent of 7,400 classrooms of 20 children and teens. Every 30 minutes a child or teen is shot in the United States. Every 3 hours and 15 minutes a child dies from gun violence. It’s time to say “no more.” We can free our nation of this scourge of gun violence. No external enemy ever took the lives of so many children and adults. We can and must change this. I am confident that most Americans value children’s safety and right to live more than they value the right of anyone to have assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines. If America can’t stand up for its children, it doesn’t stand for anything.Read Post | Comments (998)Max Little, 01/25/13MathematicianCurrent symptom tests are done in a clinic.

And because many women therefore know quite well what it\u0027s like to feel judged, they then turn that judgment back on one another.Read Post | Comments (232)Ian Bremmer, 01/26/13Author, \u0027Every Nation for Itself\u0027There have been a lot of publicity stunts to bring attention to climate change.

Your future depends on your ability to assemble an educational plan that gets you on your path of knowledge and discovery without putting you at risk of attending a school that is doomed to fail.Read Post | Comments (37)John Pavley, 01/26/13CTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI personally do not believe the U.S. Government is controlled by shadowy figures lurking behind a smoke smoke screen of faux democracy. If anything, the political and social events of the last few years are evidence that no one is ultimately \"in control\" and that every player is each equally frustrated.Read Post | Comments (21)Michael Moore, 01/25/13Oscar and Emmy-winning directorThat really should be the main takeaway from Zero Dark Thirty: That good detective work can bring fruitful results -- and that torture is wrong.
