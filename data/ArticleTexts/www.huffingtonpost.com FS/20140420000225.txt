Nearly 30 percent of American mothers with children under 18, Pew found, do not hold a job outside the home, up from 23 percent in 1999. On the surface, these findings would seem to represent a defeat for Sheryl Sandberg and her \"Lean In\" cohorts: More stay-at-home moms means that more women are opting out, eschewing \"having it all\" in favor of a more \"traditional\" arrangement in which the husband earns the money and the wife raises the kids.
