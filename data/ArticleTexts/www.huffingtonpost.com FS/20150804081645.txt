{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationIt\u0027s obvious that these attacks are the latest right-wing tactic aimed not only at destroying Planned Parenthood but also at a woman\u0027s right to control her own body. It\u0027s a campaign borrowing a page from a very old, very repetitive playbook. But let\u0027s be clear about what it means when Republican politicians crusade, over and over, to defund Planned Parenthood. Calling to defund Planned Parenthood is calling to prevent low-income women from getting lifesaving cancer screenings. It\u0027s calling to prevent HIV testing, well-woman exams, and other basic medical services. No matter how you cut it, it\u0027s an attack on the health and well-being of women, especially on those least able to afford cuts in services.Yes, losing my pregnancy was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. But it was also a universal experience, and one that now connected me to a cloud of mothers like Priscilla who gave me hope for myself and the future of my family.Healthy Living EditorOne senses -- and fears -- that anti-science ideology is so severe and permeating the Republic base that the authenticity of science itself is under attack.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesThe one constant I\u0027ve noticed is how incredibly difficult it is for transgender folks to transition and become their authentic selves and still be healthy and secure -- emotionally, physically, financially...the list goes on and on.Public speaker, activist, OlympianThere is at least one candidate who may support policies that will make it easier for people in developing countries to benefit from the knowledge the world has accumulated over many thousands of years. This can make a huge difference in their lives.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The first test of a foreign policy\u0027s coherence is whether its actions and declarations meet the standard of elementary logic. There is abundant evidence that American policies in the Middle East fail that test.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIt seems likely that the nominees in 2016 will be Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. After all, the ruling class still controls America. But the revolt against the ruling class won\u0027t end with the 2016 election, regardless. Which means the ruling class will have to change the way it rules America. Or it won\u0027t rule too much longer.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027When it comes to predicting the future, we are all looking through the glass darkly, but it is only prudent to expect that if Congress rejects a deal agreed to by the administration and much of the world, the sanctions regime will -- if not collapse -- almost certainly erode.Congressman from CaliforniaAware of the legacy of the Bush years, the Obama White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI have spent much time and effort rethinking previous policies and have designed what they are calling a \"new\" approach to security.Director, Center on National Security at Fordham Law SchoolIf the death of Cecil the lion leaves you angry and frustrated, it might be time for you to be just as furious over the deaths of unarmed civilians killed and beaten by those hired to protect and serve us. Just a thought.President, National Action NetworkLow-wage workers around the country have sparked a movement for large minimum wage increases for a reason. And their proposed increases are phased in gradually over several years. It might behoove some of those commenting from the sidelines to stop calling them crazy.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor34Justice co-founder and bloggerI\u0027ve received emails from readers informing me that my writing contradicts itself. I\u0027ve written openly and honestly about my journey through domestic violence and rape. I\u0027ve also written openly and honestly about my love of sex.Award-winning actress \u0026 authorYou have destruction; we have reconstruction. You have separated us; we are uniting. You have stones and weapons; we have books, words, pride and the will to change. You have bitterness; we have pride. You have hatred; we have love.FilmmakerGilead has the cure for Hepatitis C (HCV) known as Sofosbuvir, which is taken alone or in combination with other drugs. Now we need a cure for Gilead. The lives of 5 million HCV-infected Americans and an estimated 160 million HCV-infected people worldwide are at stake.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityThe EU was created to expand democracy, boost economic growth, and contain Germany within a democratic whole. Instead, it is destroying democracy, crushing growth, and leaving Germany\u0027s most churlish impulses to rule Europe.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027To be sure, any austerity plan imposed on the country will not be successful if it does not also embrace a complementary option that is manifestly available to provide hope to ordinary people in Greece whose mounting distress is real and must be taken into account.Emeritus Professor of Economics, University of AthensOil honchos and their legion of lobbyists petitioned Congress last week to pad corporate profits at the expense of American energy independence and national security. And Republicans on a Senate committee voted to comply.International President, United SteelworkersMake no mistake: a vote against Planned Parenthood is a vote against women\u0027s access to basic health care. But apparently some politicians prefer to get in bed with the violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement rather than have the support of women or millennial voters.President, National Organization for WomenA few days before Christmas, I got a call at work from my fertility specialist\u0027s office. The nurse told me that yes, I was pregnant. But the levels did not look great, and they wanted me to come in after the holiday to recheck the numbers again. Four losses in 13 months. I was beyond devastated.Writer, Blogger, Creator of, My dishwasher\u0027s possessed\"Niki of Xanthi\" is my first \"sun\" sculpture. It\u0027s an amorphous bas-relief on the wall of \"the House of Shadow\" in Xanthi, Greece.ArtistI\u0027m tired of people trying to inspire me to have a better, bigger, happier life. Let me exist. Let me fumble. Let me find the patch of light in the long tunnel of darkness. Let me figure out some sh*t on my own.Freelance writer and fierce truth tellerToday\u0027s announcement by President Obama gives our movement a shot in the arm. The EPA has at last issued its Clean Power Plan in final form. The real beauty of this plan is that it enables us to achieve all of these things simply by committing to do what we already know is achievable.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubFor those hoping that Big Pharma could still be blocked from the medical cannabis scene there is bad news: the deal is done. Look for the first naturally-derived, Big Pharma-produced cannabis product to be on the market by the first half of 2016, perhaps even sooner.Medical Cannabis PioneerPresident Sisi should know that the world will be watching the court\u0027s verdict on Aug. 29, and his government\u0027s response to it. Media freedom in the region is at stake. And, as the Council of Europe has put it, \"it will be the commitment shown to free speech which determines whether or not Egypt grows -- or shrinks [--] in the eyes of the world.\"LawyerI\u0027m getting ready to teach religion and sexuality in the fall. Is it \"relevant\"? Does it have \"practical\" value? Is it a \"stepping stone\" to adult professional life? To help answer these urgent questions, I present my top five reasons to study religion.Chair of the Department of Religion, Emory University and Editor of Sacred Matters MagazineLet\u0027s go back to Hwange National Park, the scene of Cecil\u0027s demise. The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, responsible for managing this park, derived most of its income for wildlife conservation across the country from trophy hunting. Let us mourn Cecil, but be careful what we wish for.Chair, IUCN Sustainable Use and Livelihoods Specialist GroupI am a southern, white, gun-owning male who worries that one day my family will have to pay the price for America\u0027s unwillingness to stand up to the gun lobby. Let me be very clear: I am not opposed to personal gun ownership. What I am opposed to is the gun lobby\u0027s stranglehold on our elected leaders.Writer, political observer, and native Floridian. Proud Gator working to create progressive change in the South and across the US.A little over 70 years ago, Paul Olum stood with his colleagues in the desert near Alamogordo, NM. They had spent the last few years designing the first atomic bomb. Six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, World War II was over -- and Paul Olum became a lifelong advocate of nuclear arms control and disarmament.Rabbi Emeritus, peace advocate and daughter of the late Paul Olum, Manhattan Project scientist and lifelong critic of the nuclear arms race.When it comes to marriage, we all have our own preconceived notions about what life will look like as a twosome that, well, quite frankly aren\u0027t true.Hardly was the ink dry after the agreement July 17 between Greece and its creditors before columnists, commentators, economists and politicians jumped to far reaching conclusions: Greece would never make it. But often overlooked is the plain fact that the destiny of nations rests with the people -- Greece is no exception.Author, \u0027The Global Economy in Transition\u0027Here\u0027s the thing, Franklin Graham isn\u0027t the voice of Christianity, let alone a stand in for the voice of God. In fact, much of the rest of Christianity has to work overtime because Franklin Graham invests so much energy saying things that make the rest of us who take God seriously shake our heads; which is why Franklin Graham is once again the worst thing to happen to God in a whileAuthor; Editor; Speaker; ActivistGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
