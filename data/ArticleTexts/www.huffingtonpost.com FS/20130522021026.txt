{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressBig news this week from WorldNetDaily, America\u0027s pre-eminent source of far-right fringe theories and weird scams: about half of America would like to see Obama impeached, including a lot of Democrats. Yeah, sure, you may have heard that Obama\u0027s overall approval ratings have held steady after this past week of scandal reporting, but look between the lines, dude. Unskew the numbers, maaaaan! Of course, the wording of the poll questions could be described as \"leading,\" if we\u0027re being really, really charitable. Back in February, HuffPost Pollster\u0027s Emily Swanson dove deeply into the way poll respondents frequently use the idea of \"impeachment\" as a catch-all way of expressing disapproval and found that \"simply asking whether people support or oppose it may produce results that overstate their support.\" Using three different methodologies, Swanson demonstrated that depending on how the question is asked, support for impeachment varies considerably.Comments (730)Mattea Kramer and Jo ComerfordIt\u0027s 2023 -- and this is America 10 years after the first across-the-board federal budget cuts known as sequestration went into effect.Comments (301)Hollye Harrington JacobsNurse, Social Worker, Educator, Author www.TheSilverPen.comThe important thing to know is that children take their coping cues from us, the trusted adults in their lives. This isn\u0027t to say that we should cover our emotions. Not at all. Rather, we need to model healthy coping mechanisms for our children.CommentsJeanne BishopMurder victims\u0027 family memberTwo elementary schools had been hit by the level EF4 storm. Children were dead. Parents who flocked to the school were reportedly kept away from the perimeter so that rescuers could hear any voices that might be crying for help. My first thought as I surveyed the rubble was, Why?Comments (84)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI am an unrepentant news junkie. If I\u0027m not getting the latest stories online, I \u0027m hearing them blaring from the TV in the next room. And have I introduced you to my husband, Phil? He makes me look uninformed. So, between the two of us, we\u0027re practically a 24-hour cable news station.Comments (19)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsDespite the fact that more journalists are now aware of the Koch brothers, many still miss the fact that Americans for Prosperity is just one of approximately 40 think tanks and advocacy groups the Kochs underwrite to promote their climate and energy agenda.Comments (104)Bill RosendahlLos Angeles City Council member for the 11th DistrictI walking more freely and faster without assistance.

Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoStriking the right balance between the government\u0027s legitimate need for confidentiality, the press\u0027s legitimate need to obtain information about government action, and the public\u0027s \"right to know\" what its representatives are up to, is a difficult and delicate task.Comments (13)Arianna HuffingtonSunday, I gave the commencement address to Smith College\u0027s class of 2013, urging them to lead the third women\u0027s revolution by redefining success, so that all of us -- women and men -- can live our lives with more grace, more joy, more empathy, more gratitude, and yes, more love.CommentsEdit SchlafferFounder, Women Without Borders/SAVESecurity is one of the last bastions of male dominance with the main focus being intelligence, military operations and law enforcement. Yet mothers are strategically located at the core of their families and are therefore typically the first to deal with their children\u0027s fear, resignation, frustration and anger.Comments (14)Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and Dr. Mark DybulAs a global community, our fates are often more intertwined than we like to imagine. Controlling malaria isn\u0027t only a prospect of preventing needless deaths, it is an economic imperative.CommentsFr. Gary M. MeierAuthor, \u0027Hidden Voices, Reflections of a Gay, Catholic Priest\u0027At the heart of every authentic call to ministry is the desire to live a life of integrity. It was my desire to live a life of integrity that led me to the priesthood and it is that same desire that has led me to where I am today.Comments (293)John R. TalbottAuthor, \u0027Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\u0027Let us all pray for our fellow Americans suffering in Oklahoma. And let us pray that we are able to differentiate between unavoidable disastrous acts of God and those invented much closer to home that we should have some control over. And let us pray for the children.Comments (167)Shirin SadeghiIndependent TV \u0026 Radio Host, ex-BBC \u0026 Al JazeeraWhat the huge disqualifications do tells us is that the Supreme Leader and his hardline establishment are flexing their muscles for anyone who\u0027s looking for trouble at this year\u0027s presidential election.CommentsMarcus WilliamsonAdjunct professor of political science, Oklahoma City UniversityTornadoes do not leave an identity to define our sorrow and struggle around, and closure cannot be as complete. They only leave destruction before pulling back and vanishing into the sky. This ability to turn the lack of closure into a passion to improve is what sets Oklahomans apart.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Shredding privacy is the essence of Tumblr\u0027s appeal to Yahoo, and even though it has said it will retain the social networking site\u0027s founders in key positions, one way or another that very personal data will be mined and inevitably fall into what users will discover to be the wrong hands.Comments (39)Julie UptonRegistered dietitian; Co-author, \u0027The Real Skinny: Appetite for Health’s 101 Fat Habits \u0026 Slim Solutions\u0027I travel a lot for work and often find myself in airports and in unfamiliar cities wondering where and what I can eat that will fill me up, not out.

Yet as I write this, I am trying to sign a group with a song called \"Bath Salts\" and an album titled \"D.R.U.G.S.\"Comments (13)Paul AbramsLast person on Earth not on FacebookEnding oil industry subsidies to pay for clean-up and restitution from a climate catastrophe feels fitting. It will raise the money to satisfy Coburn, and make a point that cannot be overemphasized.Comments (45)Barbara Hannah GruffermanAuthor, \u0027The Best of Everything After 50\u0027; Columnist, AARP; Host, AARP YouTube ChannelA few years ago -- around the time I was turning 50 and trying to come to grips with the changes my body, mind and life were going through -- I decided to start running, against my better judgment.Comments (47)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupPetty\u0027s voice has never been conventionally pretty, but it\u0027s well preserved, and he sounds great sneering over all those chiming Telecaster chords and squealing Les Paul riffs. He also looks better than ever, thanks to some bold but effective fashion choices and a beard that nicely softens his beaky features.Comments (13)Timothy KurekAuthor, \u0027The Cross in the Closet\u0027In a country that is increasingly polarized politically and religiously, it\u0027s always a breath of fresh air to encounter a group or a movement that strays from the social norm.

The key is to use our brainpower to make sure that our contributions to others don\u0027t come at the expense of our own interests.Comments (49)Richard C. LevinPresident of Yale UniversityWe leave together. You leave Yale College after four years; I leave the Yale Presidency after twenty. I find myself thinking about a Grateful Dead song written in 1970, the year I came to Yale as a graduate student. You know the words: \"Lately it occurs to me, what a long, strange trip it\u0027s been.\" It\u0027s been a long trip, but, for us, more wonderful than strange.Comments (69)Desmond Tutu, Sohaila Abdulali and Jacob LiefYes, governments must step up. But so should we all. Why shouldn\u0027t rape be dinner table conversation? We talk about war, we talk about death, we discuss values with our children.
