{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranPolitically, the faux fight over Hagel\u0027s nomination has dramatically shown a Republican Party in complete disarray, in the midst of their own civil war. On one hand, there are some Republican senators who, today, put the nation above politics and refused to engage in sliming a great American veteran. On the other hand, there is an increasingly shrill fringe right who, in conjunction with the same neoconservatives who led us into Iraq, continue to show that they will put anything -- even American security -- below their own self-aggrandizement and continued campaign to oppose anything the Obama administration says or does.Read Post | Comments (75)George Lakoff, 02/26/13Author, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027In short, the sequester is not just about money and political power for the Republicans in the House.
