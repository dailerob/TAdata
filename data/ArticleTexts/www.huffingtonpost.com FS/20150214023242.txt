{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027I live on the outskirts of Chapel Hill (across the tracks, literally). It\u0027s been a heartbreaking time for everyone here, a frightening time for many Muslims (and those who might \"look Muslim\") in the region, and also a time of stirring, heartfelt solidarity and shared mourning. At a vigil at UNC Wednesday night, which was so full I couldn\u0027t hear the words from the stage but so hushed we could hear one another breathe, it was the perfect American ordinariness of the victims\u0027 family photos that brought me to tears. It\u0027s also the American ordinariness of the killer\u0027s images and attitudes that scares and saddens me. People have been quick to interpret these horrible slayings. Here are a few thoughts on how the world looks from here.If the United States is truthfully aiming to curb its global military endeavors, neither Congress nor the president are making that clear. The faux dispute over the most recent proposal ignores the realities of this administration\u0027s legal logic and leaves its endless war mentality intact. The job description for 2016 hopefuls may as well read \"No Limits.\"Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveAs Valentine\u0027s Day approaches, our thoughts turn to romance. Unfortunately, many of our cultural myths about love, from fairy tales to rom coms, paint a very distorted picture. Love is not the pot of gold waiting at the end of a quest, incarnated in a single perfect partner. Instead it\u0027s something we need with us every step of the way.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachThe tragic shooting of three young university students at UNC Chapel Hill yesterday could have been adopted by the media as yet another indictment of the rampant gun culture in the United States.Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University; Author, \u0027A Universe From Nothing\u0027Do all sons want to be \"better\" than their fathers? Do all fathers want the same for their sons -- that they grow to be \"better\" -- or do they secretly, perhaps unconsciously, always want to be someone their sons can look up to in every which way?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarPresident Obama is absolutely correct that our nation must confront these ruthless terrorists. But he was also correct to promise that America would not be sending U.S. combat troops back to the Middle East to fight another ground war.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeFor me, he represented the idea that writing could still be informed and provocative -- even about things like the media, especially about things like the media. He represented to me that quality still matters.Freelance writer and editorIn the 17 days since the Greek national elections brought Alexis Tsipras and his SYRIZA party to power, the Eurocrisis has once again taken center stage, threatening not just the future of the unified currency and the European ideal, but also global economic and strategic stability.Chairman, Financial Crisis Inquiry CommissionMarking, celebrating and memorializing the beautiful lives of Deah, Yuzor and Razan is, in addition to whatever comfort and solace it can bring the aggrieved, an opportunity for all of us who didn\u0027t know them to reflect on how we ourselves might be better people.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillThe anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States isn\u0027t just rising, it\u0027s really high. An unwillingness and indifference on the part of individuals and institutions to put it in check is a large part of the problem.Executive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityBEIRUT -- ISIS\u0027 horrific immolation of a caged Lt. Muath Al-Kaseasbeh, the Jordanian pilot, will have been done in full understanding of the emotional impact of the manner of his death on Jordanians and in the West: This was very deliberate -- not some spur-of-the-moment act of barbarism. It is important to understand what lies behind and beyond the event itself.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027Why are so many girls, especially girls of color, confined in our nation\u0027s detention facilities, and what are we as a society going to do about it? We must all work tirelessly to give hope and a fair chance to these girls and all children by promoting policies, programs, and supports that help them and their families, especially those most at risk.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn terms of playing to the public\u0027s softer side, we might understand the logic behind a visual strategy of bringing the kids. But when you really look at it, the optic of family values just doesn\u0027t mix well with the optic of gun rights advocacy.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesAs a military mom, I believe it\u0027s our sacred duty to honor the service of those who have sacrificed for our country. We owe thanks today and every day to those who wear the uniform. That is one of the reasons why First Lady Michelle Obama and I started Joining Forces in the first place.Second Lady of the United StatesWhen I first moved in with my husband after college, I thought we\u0027d be on the same page about everything -- why wouldn\u0027t we? We loved each other, so therefore we’d have the same thought process about living together. Until one day...Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostPresident Obama\u0027s proposal to repeal of the 2002 AUMF, which I have long fought for, is a positive sign, but we must address the root of the problem. Congress must repeal the 2001 AUMF, which allows any president to wage perpetual war, in any place and at any time.U.S. Representative, California\u0027s 13th congressional districtI would like to take this occasion to share an experience in which President Reagan (for whom I had not voted) taught me something powerful and lasting regarding the value -- and importance -- of loving (yes I mean loving) our country.Gerontologist, psychologist, author, entrepreneur and public speakerJulia announced that she was transgender and would heretofore prefer to be referred to as \"he\" and by a new name \"Jules.\" I instantly understood why \"he\" did not want his hair done. He did not want to look like a girl.MotherWhen it comes to the defining issues of our future, India will have a seat at the table.Fmr. three-term mayor of New York City; Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LPWhy the reluctance of many democratic societies, in Europe and beyond, to recognize that anti-Semitism is the canary in the coal mine alerting them to the existential threat they face? Why does Prime Minister Valls seem more like an exception than like the rule?National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueThe limits under Obama\u0027s proposed authorization are an important distinction, which we hope will carry on through future administrations. However, on maybe the most important limit -- the limit on types of operations our ground troops can be committed to -- the language is too broad, and leaves too much room for drawn-out combat missions.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranManaging Director, Vet Voice FoundationOn 7 May Britain will vote in the most important General Election for a generation. But there is real doubt about whether the new generation of voters will have their say... This general election will have huge consequences for the young.Leader of the OppositionHis \"solution\" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a recipe for obliterating Israel as both Jewish and democratic, and converting it into an apartheid state, reviled by the international community and condemned to live in isolation and disgrace.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUMore Americans are dying of drug overdoses than traffic accidents, primarily from heroin and prescription pills like oxycodone and Vicodin. Every single day, 120 people die in the U.S. of a drug overdose.Founder \u0026 CEO, ShatterproofThe horrendous killings of three young Muslim-American university students near the University of North Carolina by an atheist man Tuesday evening has prompted authorities there to look at the incident as a possible hate crime.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWith Valentine\u0027s Day approaching, you might be thinking about what gift of jewelry you can give that special someone that perfectly expresses your love. Consider, too, how that gift can support peace -- what it represents from mine to maker -- and make Congo\u0027s future a part of that decision.Emmanuelle Chriqui, well-known for her role in the HBO series “Entourage”, is a long-time Congo human rights activist who works closely with the Enough Project and its Raise Hope for Congo campaign. Follow her on Twitter: @echriquiDean Smith clearly touched many individual lives, but he also affected the world in which he lived. He was especially committed to fighting racial discrimination and wasn\u0027t afraid to speak out against the nuclear arms race, and he publicly opposed the death penalty -- all issues that didn\u0027t have great support in his environment.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersTo prevent our children from being sickened and threatened with death by preventable disease, we need to ensure that they get vaccinated. But, to make our vaccination program successful, we also need to find better ways to inoculate ourselves against misinformation. A good place to start is to arm ourselves with the facts.Editorial Director, Union of Concerned ScientistsThe resilience of the survivors upon emerging from the Nazi death camps and other sites of persecution and oppression and their ability to not just rebuild their lives but teach their children and grandchildren by example to continue to have faith in humankind is evidence, to me at least, that a dawn follows even the darkest of nights.Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsTonight I\u0027m joined by actor and comedian Garrett Morris, one of the original cast members of Saturday Night Live. In the clip I ask Garrett which of his many memorable SNL characters is his all-time favorite.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorIf Americans utilized the outrage over American Sniper, the Brian Williams saga, and Kanye West rushing the stage at the Grammys, and aimed this vitriol at President Obama\u0027s request for a new war, we could possibly avert yet another colossal mistake.Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"DEMS IN WAR POWERS REVOLT",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
