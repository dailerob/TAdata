{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027It is not up to journalists to decide that gun permits are public information. It\u0027s up to us as citizens to decide that, as a matter of law. If there is something wrong with that, then change the law. If society is not comfortable with making that information public, then don\u0027t try to make it somewhat public, public-with-effort. There\u0027s no half-pregnant. In the net age, there\u0027s no slightly public. I hate to see a news organization being condemned for trafficking in public information. I would also hate to see journalists end up campaigning to make less information public. Journalists, of all people, should be fighting to make more information public.Read Post | CommentsJohn Cusack, 01/14/13Makes filmsRecently, I sat down with George Washington Law School professor and constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley and my close friend Kevin McCabe to discuss WikiLeaks\u0027 impact on transparency, the government\u0027s response, and the comparison to the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg.Read Post | Comments (109)Peter Farrelly, 01/14/13Writer/directorWhat happened to driving in a car and just looking out the window? Your kids are giving up the entire physical world for this narcissistic/sychophantic/addictive need to follow someone or see who\u0027s following them.Read Post | Comments (490)Matthew Modine, 01/14/13Actor, Activist, Filmmaker, HumanistAs a nation we cannot be shackled to an archaic Second Amendment which is being shielded by a minority of Americans that demand the right to use weapons that are continually killing citizens across our country.Read Post | Comments (289)John Stamos, 01/14/13Actor and producerAfter my dad died, Jack and I didn\u0027t talk any more than we had before. We didn\u0027t see each other more often -- nothing really changed. But Jack became that important male figure in my life that I wanted to make proud.Read Post | Comments (15)Howard Fineman, 01/14/13Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupA new Huffington Post/YouGov poll shows voters modestly hopeful about Barack Obama\u0027s chances of being more successful in his second term. And, given the haplessness of his Republican foes, Obama is in an unusually strong position to deliver on the potential of his second term -- but only if he has the will and wherewithal to turn ballot-box victory into real-life results.Read Post | Comments (464)Laurie David, 01/14/13Producer, author, NRDC TrusteeEnough is enough. Beyoncé\u0027s Pepsi deal was a serious lapse of judgment. And the White House tarnishes its own \"brand\" by selecting her to sing the national anthem at the inauguration, unwittingly boosting the beverage industry that is helping to drive the obesity epidemic.Read Post | Comments (358)Michael B. Keegan, 01/14/13President, People for the American WayBachmann and the Tea Party have proven time and again that they don\u0027t take the business of governing seriously. Boehner and his fellow Republican leaders should stop pretending like they do.Read Post | Comments (49)Graham Nash, 01/14/13Singer-Songwriter, Photographer and ActivistIn my humble opinion, the judges\u0027 ruling, granting Manning a 112-day reduction in any sentence he might receive, is welcome but far short of true justice. If the military broke its own laws and President Obama even declared publicly that Manning had broken the law, then how can anyone say that this could be a \"fair\" trial?Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 01/14/13Author and political correspondent, TheRoot.comA google search of \"I hate Lena Dunham\" now produces more than a million results, which is quite a lot for someone who entered the public conscious less than a year ago. The question is why?Read Post | Comments (149)Daniel Ellsberg, 01/13/13Former American military analyst who sparked a national uproar in 1971.The mystique of secrecy in the universe of national security, even beyond the formal apparatus of classification and clearances, is a compelling deterrent to whistleblowing and thus to effective resistance to gravely wrongful or dangerous policies.Read Post | Comments (53)Douglas Anthony Cooper, 01/14/13Novelist, Amnesia (See: Blogger Mortis)The NRA feeds its members on a steady diet of fear. \"If we give an inch, then we\u0027re on that infernal toboggan to the hell where all guns are banned.\" Hence? Give nothing.Read Post | Comments (11)Michael Hogan, 01/14/13Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupBy the time Oscar night rolls around, we hope that our model will feature the most reliable picks anywhere -- supplementing the educated guesswork that constitutes most efforts at awards prognostication. (I say supplementing, not supplanting, because we are, after all, avid fans and practitioners of such guesswork.)Read Post | Comments (29)Eric Boehlert, 01/14/13Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaAll the right-wing chatter today about how Obama\u0027s following Hitler\u0027s lead by allegedly voiding the Second Amendment only adds fuel to an unwanted fire.Read Post | Comments (19)Dean Baker, 01/14/13Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027While the politics of cutting Social Security are bad, it also doesn\u0027t make much sense as policy. From a policy standpoint it would make far more sense to tax Wall Street speculation.Read Post | CommentsRobert P. Stoker, 01/14/13Associate professor of political science, public policy and public administration, George Washington UniversityAlthough Obama has considered the chained CPI, he has also advocated raising the FICA tax cap. His proposal does not go far enough to preserve Social Security. A better alternative is to expand the tax base, not merely by increasing the FICA tax cap but by taxing other income sources.Read Post | Comments (407)Maureen Ryan, 01/14/13TV critic, The Huffington PostJodie Foster wittily surveyed her career and broached the topic of her sexual orientation in front of millions of people (even if she never said the words \"gay\" or \"lesbian,\" her meaning was clear).Read Post | Comments (121)Tom Engelhardt, 01/14/13Editor, TomDispatch.comWhile the administration is pledging to try to curb the wholesale spread of ever more powerful weaponry at home, what is it doing about the same issue abroad where it has so much more power to pursue the agenda it prefers?Read Post | Comments (28)D.L. Hughley, 01/14/13Actor and stand-up comedianThis is why it is so difficult to have a national conversation on guns in this country. One side is interested in reasonable solutions. The other side is interested in living in a delusional fantasyland where President Obama is a Marxist, a Nazi, a Kenyan and now, apparently, King George.Read Post | Comments (267)Robert Kuttner, 01/13/13Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027On budget issues, Obama has been just dismal. One can only conclude that he is in bed with the wrong people -- those who believe that the road to prosperity is through austerity.Read Post | Comments (144)Michelangelo Signorile, 01/14/13Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhatever you thought of last night, you\u0027d have to agree that it was another indication of how it\u0027s becoming harder and harder for anyone in public life to have any real credibility and still be living in the closet.Read Post | Comments (293)Doug Kendall, 01/14/13Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterThe Takings Clause made national news last week with the spectacle of AIG playing Hamlet in debating whether \"to sue, or not to sue\" the federal government over the terms of the company\u0027s bailout -- a rather backhanded way of thanking American taxpayers for keeping the company from bankruptcy in 2008.Read Post | Comments (19)Robert Creamer, 01/14/13Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIt is of course true that in politics the perception of power translates into the reality of power. The problem is that once it becomes clear that you\u0027re all hat and no cattle, the myth of power rapidly collapses into a pile of dust. That is exactly what is happening to the NRA.Read Post | Comments (387)Yoni Freedhoff M.D. , 01/14/13Assistant Professor, Faculty of Medicine, University of OttawaWhile I personally find The Biggest Loser to be an emotionally and physically abusive, misinformative, horror show, it\u0027s clearly beloved and trusted by many. And while my personal opinions shouldn\u0027t concern you, the peer-reviewed medical literature should.Read Post | CommentsMichael Smerconish, 01/14/13Radio hostWhy was it so difficult to avoid the fiscal cliff? Especially when, in the end, Congress couldn\u0027t salvage a grand bargain à la Simpson-Bowles, but instead settled for a quick fix?Read Post | Comments (36)Bill Moyers and Michael Winship, 01/14/13Big Money, as Krugman writes in his book, buys Big Influence. And that\u0027s why the financiers of Wall Street never truly experience regime change -- their cash brings both political parties to heel.Read Post | CommentsDeb Baer, 01/14/13Entertainment writer and editorA lot of people will say that it was up to her when and where to come out, and they\u0027re absolutely right, but that still doesn\u0027t mean she wasn\u0027t a coward, and it doesn\u0027t change the fact that she could have helped millions of people by coming out years ago.Read Post | Comments (755)Michael Brenner, 01/14/13Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe intellectual doldrums stultifying American foreign policy create incentive to take the initiative; they at the same time resist any deviation from the inertial course.Read Post | Comments (32)Leo W. Gerard, 01/14/13International President, United SteelworkersIf America can\u0027t manufacture No. 2 pencils, how long will it be before it can\u0027t manufacture ballistic missiles? Maybe that\u0027s the pitchfork manufacturing workers need to prod politicians to deal with middle class job uncertainty.Read Post | Comments (50)Jordan Schultz, 01/13/13The Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportSeattle Seahawks rookie quarterback Russell Wilson pulled off the greatest playoff comeback since 1957 ... and lost.Read Post | Comments (57)Bill Frezza, 01/14/13Fellow, Competitive Enterprise Institute; Venture Partner, Adams Capital ManagementThere it was in the recent Fiscal Cliff deal -- more tax breaks for windmills, electric cars, biodiesel, algae (algae?!), and of course 14 different flavors of ethanol.
