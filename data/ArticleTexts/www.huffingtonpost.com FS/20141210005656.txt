If there is any positive to come out of the release of this report, and turmoil that may come as a result of facts being released, let it be, finally, a wake-up call. Let it lead to the American people immediately disqualifying any candidate for president, in 2016, who won\u0027t clearly and definitively rule out the use of torture by intelligence or military under their administration.

I am only ignored. In 13 years of imprisonment without charge, I\u0027ve never been able to tell anyone who I really am. I am not ISN 026. That is the government\u0027s number. My name is Fahd Abdullah Ahmed Ghazy. I am a human being -- a man -- who is loved and who loves.Detainee, Guantánamo BayDo not be silent. Do not be complacent.
