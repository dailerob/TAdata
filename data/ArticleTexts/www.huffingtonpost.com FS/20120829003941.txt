{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"HuffPost Live is bringing you Shadow Conventions 2012 with the goal of sparking a national conversation on three issues that neither party is seriously addressing: the corrupting influence of money on our politics, the persistence of poverty in America, and the disastrous war on drugs. Our new streaming network will devote a day during each of the national conventions to focusing on one of those three issues. Today, HuffPost Live\u0027s team of host/producers will be joined by a broad range of politicians, thought leaders, activists, and celebrities for in-depth interviews and panel discussions on various aspects of the drug war. And we want you to be a central part of these discussions. That\u0027s what HuffPost Live is all about -- sparking real conversations about issues that impact our lives. The Shadow Conventions are your conventions. Join us and be part of a convention that\u0027s unscripted, surprising, and a lot more interesting than the over-produced political commercials in Tampa and Charlotte.Read Post | Comments (1,675)Steph Sherer, 08/28/12Executive Director, Americans for Safe AccessWe want Obama\u0027s campaign to know that they aren\u0027t meeting their volunteer goals in deep-blue counties because people are finding this president\u0027s policies on cannabis too hard to swallow.Read Post | Comments (290)Terri Gaffney, MPA, RN, 08.28.2012Terri Gaffney, MPA, RNWhen it comes to leadership at the highest levels, nurses are thin on the ground. In 2011, an American Hospital Association survey found that nurses hold only 6 percent of seats on hospital boards. So when decisions are being made about budgets, strategy, and policy, there usually isn\u0027t input from those who understand patient needs best.Read Post | Comments (18)Leonard Frieling, 08/28/12Speaker for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition; Defense AttorneyOpposing the war on drugs is often portrayed as a liberal issue. But it is also a conservative issue for anyone who champions states\u0027 rights, smaller government, more efficient spending, personal responsibility and other classic \"republican\" values.Read Post | Comments (79)Kevin A. Sabet, Ph.D., 08/28/12Asst. Professor, University of FloridaIt makes sense to devote our time and resources now to stopping drug use before it starts, intervening on early use, treating addiction, and enforcing our laws justly and smartly.Read Post | Comments (314)Robert Reich, 08/28/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Presumably the Romney campaign continues its false claims because they\u0027re effective. But this raises a more basic question: How can they remain effective when they\u0027ve been so overwhelmingly discredited by the media?Read Post | CommentsHarry Shearer, 08/28/12Your dog\u0027s best friendAs we wait to see what effect Isaac will have on the Army Corps of Engineers $10 billion-plus \"hurricane risk reduction system\" in New Orleans, I can\u0027t help thinking about last week\u0027s news from levees.org. When government adopts efficiency as its top priority, decisions like the Corps\u0027 get made. And people die.Read Post | Comments (129)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 08/27/12Author, research psychologist, and gender expertThe idea that your parents might have liked or like a sibling more than you is tough to take, sure. But know that parents can love all their children, even if they favor one over the other.Read Post | Comments (70)John Hillcoat, 08/28/12Director, \u0027Lawless\u0027I have always wanted to make a gangster movie. However like all genres, they need to be somehow reinvented, made fresh again.Read Post | CommentsAllen Frances, 08/28/12Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThat other drug war, which we couldn\u0027t possibly lose, is against the excessive use of legal drugs that is promoted by our own pharmaceutical companies.Read Post | Comments (13)Dean Baker, 08/27/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Last week Mitt Romney committed himself to picking a Federal Reserve Board chairman who will try to keep workers\u0027 wages down, likely costing them tens of thousands of dollars over the next decade. You remember reading the front-page news stories on this pronouncement?Read Post | Comments (210)Lloyd I. Sederer, MD, 08/27/12Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthCan we wage war with something that is not an actual enemy, not a sovereign power or an uprising within a nation?Read Post | Comments (19)John Hodgman, 08/27/12Author, actor, comedian, and minor television personalityI will reveal here that I am going to vote for Obama, and I hope he wins, and here is the reason: I LIKE WINNING.Read Post | Comments (662)Marlo Thomas, 08/28/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistWhat is it about icons like Diana that make them so unforgettable? And why do some stars fade away, while others continue to burn brightly long after they leave us?Read Post | Comments (26)Sen. Ben Cardin, 08/28/12Democratic U.S. Senator from MarylandThe act of voting is a right -- not a privilege -- in our country. American men and women have fought and died to defend and to exercise their right to vote. What Republicans are doing across the country is a blatant violation of the civil rights of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans.Read Post | Comments (49)LearnVest, 08/28/12The pre-eminent website for women and their moneyYou should never rely on someone else to manage everything for you. Does this mean, now that I\u0027m grown and married myself, that I regard my husband with perpetual skepticism, always under the assumption that he\u0027s about to take the money and run? Not at all.Read Post | CommentsRep. Susan A. Davis, 08/28/12U.S. Representative from California\u0027s 53rd Congressional DistrictWhile a ban currently exists on abortion coverage in federal insurance programs, within these plans there is an exception for rape survivors. Women in the military, who put their lives on the line every day for our freedom, are not covered under their military health coverage if their pregnancy is the result of rape.Read Post | Comments (15)Dan Froomkin, 08/28/12Senior Washington Correspondent, Huffington PostWith so much at stake, journalists have good reason to go beyond the empty sound bites and, at the very least, ask people who talk about creating jobs: What sorts of jobs?Read Post | Comments (156)Kevin Bell, 08/28/12Researcher, Army VeteranOur society\u0027s often puerile reaction to discussions about drugs and depression must change if we are going to see any permanent improvements in mental health treatment take root in the at-risk veteran population.Read Post | Comments (13)Dan Petegorsky, 08/28/12National outreach manager, Campaign for a Fair SettlementAs Republicans gather in Tampa this week, they\u0027ve got a bit of a problem: figuring out how to wine, dine, and celebrate their sugar daddies in style without ripping back the veil of secrecy they\u0027ve drawn over their super-wealthy backers.Read Post | CommentsGov. Jennifer M. Granholm, 08/27/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyIt seems the Republican obsession with being pro-life lasts about nine months. After that, it\u0027s each baby for herself. So Democrats, let\u0027s be clear and strong: Being pro-birth is not automatically the same thing as being pro-life.Read Post | Comments (419)Amanda Feilding, 08/28/12Director, The Beckley FoundationThe current, illegal and totally unregulated market is the worst possible solution to the problems with which drugs and drug-use confront society.Read Post | Comments (16)Megan McLemore, 08/28/12Senior health researcher, Human Rights WatchLast year, President Obama recognized the progress against the HIV epidemic, but it was dealt a serious blow in January, when Congress reinstated a ban on federal funding of syringe exchange programs.Read Post | CommentsJeffrey Sachs, 08/28/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027Poverty reduction has entered a new era. Mobile phones and wireless broadband enable new models of business development and service delivery. New methods of prevention, diagnosis and treatment are controlling ancient scourges such as malaria.Read Post | CommentsJonathan Marshall, 08/28/12Author, \u0027The Lebanese Connection: Corruption, Civil War, and The International Drug Trade\u0027It\u0027s time to turn conventional wisdom upside down. Fighting drugs is not a precondition for security. On the contrary, security is a necessary condition for curbing drugs.Read Post | Comments (11)Kerry Kennedy, 08/27/12President, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsDespite his civilian dress, there was no mistaking his role in the secret police when he reached into our Toyota to block the Nikon lens of my 17-year-old daughter Mariah. She was recording the beating of a woman by his colleagues.Read Post | Comments (20)Will Bunch, 08/28/12Author, \u0027The Backlash\u0027The notion of debating policy in the public forum of a convention became a quaint relic of the era before television and before the Vince Lombardiazation of American politics, before winning wasn\u0027t everything but the only thing.Read Post | CommentsWomen \u0026 Co, 2012.28.08Dan Solin, 2012.28.08Zach Stafford, 2012.28.08Sheri and Allan Rivlin, 2012.28.08Robert Reich, 2012.28.08John Hillcoat, 2012.28.08Mark Olmsted, 2012.28.08G.
