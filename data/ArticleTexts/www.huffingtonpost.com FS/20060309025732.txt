{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From thinkprogress.orgFrom uoregon.eduFrom .hofesh.org.ilListening to the Bush administration\u0027s increasingly ridiculous attempts to spin the disastrous reality on the ground in Iraq, I\u0027m wondering if they\u0027ve hired the venerable messaging team of Ionesco, Beckett, and Genet.
