{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureMost striking in the presidential campaign right now is the extent to which all of the major Democratic candidates have endorsed populist economic and political reforms. All three leading candidates have plans to raise taxes on the rich, crack down on corporate tax havens and loopholes, and limit capital gains tax breaks for investors. All support raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing paid family leave and paid vacation days, and empowering workers to organize and bargain collectively. All call for curbing the role of big money in politics. All favor action on climate change and a larger public investment in infrastructure and R\u0026D. The contrast with the Republican field is stark and clear. The growing populist movement in this country is driving this debate.The crude nature of the Pentagon\u0027s blatant anti-Russian propaganda campaign following the Russian cruise missile attack inside Syria only underscores the difficult position the Russian missile attacks have placed the United States, both regionally and globally.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Suppose we arm everyone -- do we really want to live in that kind of country and raise our children there? Or send our children to college on those campuses, as I will do for the first time next fall?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersTwo weeks ago, America\u0027s first \"honest politician\" Gil Fulbright announced his bid for the White House. Fulbright is a satirical candidate cashing in on the flood of money in politics by doing whatever his donors want.Director, Represent.UsOur political system is built on the promise of democracy for all, not democracy for those who can afford to drive cross-state to get an ID. How can GOP leaders and presidential candidates continue to insist with a straight face that there\u0027s no need to restore protections for voters?Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationChaos is king. Chaos reigns in the House Republican Caucus, reflecting the chaos from the Republican presidential campaign trail. The question is what will emerge from this maelstrom?Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAll empires fail and eventually devour themselves. The U.S. empire is no different. Not repeatedly doing what has failed is the first step toward correction. How much better and cheaper it would be if years ago we became a humanitarian power -- well-received by the deprived billions in these anguished lands.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorParents must control technology or risk technology controlling their kids. Even starting a dialogue with your kid about the effects of over-dependence on technology is a step in the right direction.Psychotherapist, Author of \u0027When Kids Call the Shots\u0027It doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re in your 20s or your 40s. If there\u0027s negativity and worry infiltrating your self concept, it\u0027s up to you to do the mental working of cleaning up your act. Here are eight toxic thoughts you need to let go of:Lifestyle writer, blogger, and cancer survivor sharing style, beauty, and wellness advice for women on HerAfter.comWestern diplomats are fond of legally and neatly putting things in boxes. Kremlin tactics are quite the opposite. Russian military thinking doesn\u0027t see a clean breakdown between what are weapons of war and what are civilian tools, or what are propaganda forums and what are channels for frank talks. The diplomats and talks are part of the offensive.Author, \u0027Fragile Empire: How Russia Fell In and Out of Love with Vladimir Putin\u0027Public brouhaha aside, from a climate change policy perspective, what is most troubling about this scandal is not what the company did, but the vulnerabilities it exposed in environmental policy.Research fellow at Stockholm Environment Institute, working on energy and climate change policiesSenior Research Fellow, Stockholm Environment InstituteThere is so much about basic preventative care that\u0027s broken in our health care system, mental health is hardly even on the radar. Therapy, while no longer exactly stigmatized, as long as it\u0027s in the pop-culture context of self-help or increased productivity, is still very much an add-on.Humanist, Progressive, BAMFHow dare you, Raven hyphen alternate spelling of \"Simone?\" Sitting there with a head full of colorful weave, the same sort of hair that was \"ghetto,\" \"tacky,\" \"low-class\" and \"unacceptable\" until it made it\u0027s way until the pages of mainstream fashion magazines?The premiere online magazine destination for African-American cultural insight, news and perspective.As Democrats get ready for a presidential debate in Las Vegas, it\u0027s clear that the Elizabeth Warren wing of American politics has fundamentally shifted the ground on which candidates will stand Tuesday night.Co-founder, Progressive Change Campaign Committee (BoldProgressives.org)Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the well-being of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully. Most Republicans say don\u0027t worry.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The escalation of tension among the American-Muslim community is an opportunity for us to once more examine the role of religion in society from a multi-disciplinary lens. It is an opportunity to reject the simplistic and sensational narrative that is leading to a cycle of violence.Manal Omar is the Associate Vice-President for the Middle East and Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C. Manal has over fifteen years working in the field of women\u0027s rights, peacebuilding, humanitarian aid, and development.

Can you still really call a place your home if you don\u0027t feel safe there anymore?As Congress considers the federal budget in the coming months, we urge our colleagues in the House and Senate to join us in supporting robust funding for Guatemala. Specifically, we believe it is crucial that funding be directed to institutions that keep the government accountable.Representative from the 16th Congressional District of New YorkU.S. Representative from Massachusetts\u0027 2nd DistrictPro-Black means you fight for your people. All of your people. Not just Black men, not just straight Black men, not just Black men you think are upstanding and productive members of society, but all of your people.Writer and poetAs a presidential candidate with a public platform it\u0027s puzzling that, in addition to calling out a marginalized religious community, you would be singling these issues out in another faith group and failing to call out discrimination within your own.Director of interfaith Community Organizing Residency at Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for JusticeA friendly reminder to organizations in regular communication with the public: You never know who John Q. Public is.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Although it is rarely hyped, CHIP continues to have strong bipartisan support at the federal and state levels, including strong support from our nation\u0027s governors, as it quietly goes about the business of efficiently providing health coverage to over 8 million children in low-income working families across the country.President, First Focus \u0026 First Focus Campaign for ChildrenFollowing yet another mass shooting in Oregon leaving nine people dead and several injured, the GOP has, yet again, turned on the platitude generator, prepared their excuses, and spewed out another plethora of idiotic comments. That shooting was number 264 of the mass shootings in 274 days this year.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comElijah is an inspiring example to other young people--and all of us--of resilience, grace, and the ability to beat the odds.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundCan Bernie be elected? To be sure. If elected, could he be effective? Absolutely. Does his candidacy threaten the Democratic Party? Absolutely not; quite the contrary.

And with the right kind of leadership and advocacy, it might even become probable.Director of Strategic Planning for the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice, Harvard Law SchoolRegardless of how much more we pour into Afghanistan, without forcing major political changes we are not going to see the results we have been seeking.
