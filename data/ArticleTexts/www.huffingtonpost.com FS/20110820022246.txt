He is angry, arrogant, manipulative, selfish, and above all, fame hungry.Read Post | CommentsReza Aslan, 8/19/11Founder, AslanMedia.com; Author, \u0027Beyond Fundamentalism\u0027The stage is set for a showdown this weekend between two prevailing forces in Israeli society: one which advocates national security above all else, and one which believes a country that prides itself on being a prosperous democracy must meet its obligations to its weakest citizens.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins and Zach Carter, 8/18/11It\u0027s been a while since we\u0027ve heard that trumpet voluntary from the Treasury Department, signaling the sending of another press release celebrating the fact that \"TARP worked!\" But this week, the horns sounded.Read Post | CommentsJeff Wald, 8/19/11CEO, ARIA Multimedia EntertainmentConservative and Liberal are labels we are given to divide us.
