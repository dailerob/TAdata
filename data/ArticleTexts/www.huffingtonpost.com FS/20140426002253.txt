{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarOne of the best things about Twitter -- indeed, perhaps its greatest appeal -- is in its accessibility. It\u0027s easy to use both for sharing information and for collecting it. Twitter provides unprecedented access to our lawmakers and to our celebrities, as well as to news as it\u0027s happening. A recent study out of MIT even suggests that analyzing crowd statements on Twitter may allow researchers to predict the future, citing as one example early tweets associated with the 2013 coup d\u0027état in Egypt. But Twitter -- and all that accessible information -- has some undeniable downsides, too.In this life-affirming video, Sue Austin goes where few have been... in her wheelchair. Refusing to be defined by pity or limitations, she proves that we can\u0027t let ourselves be defined by how other people see us -- and that telling our own story sets us free.TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"I realize I am in the privileged position of having, by some trick of the genetic lottery, the type of body our society has deemed attractive. But that isn\u0027t why I love my body. I love it because body-positivity is a radical act of love.Priya DieterichStudent, Bard High School Early CollegeDo the usual cities and beaches leave you a bit... underwhelmed? Well, we\u0027re here to bring you to a magical realm of bubbling volcanoes, cliff-top castles, and roaring waterfalls.minubeTravel planning website and communityWe have come too far, and battled far too long with the tobacco industry, to make the mistake of trusting the e-cigarette manufacturers to do what is right for America\u0027s children. How long was it before the tobacco industry would admit that smoking causes cancer?Margaret I. Cuomo, M.D.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027The case for providing the basics for all children in America is hard to refute. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2.2 million children were lifted out of poverty by SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, in 2012. Yet right now we are fast approaching a critical time for hungry children: summer vacation.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWe have a national problem with not expecting or teaching boys to control themselves when they are quite clearly biologically capable of doing so. That\u0027s a gap no one is talking about on Sunday morning news programs.Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderStorytelling is one of our oldest art forms, and oldest urges, dating back to the Stone Age, when the ancients told their stories by carving them on the walls of their dwellings. Millions of years later, native Indians would carry on the tradition, gathering in a circle around a fire, while their tribal leader told them a tale to end their weary day.Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activist\"Maybe I sinned, and maybe I need to ask forgiveness,\" said Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who has been lauded by conservatives for his resistance to paying fees for illegally grazing his cattle on government land since 1993, in an interview on CNN on Friday.Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminarySouthern Whites didn\u0027t vote for Obama (and by association, won\u0027t vote for Democrats). So argues the New York Times\u0027 Nate Cohn in a provocative piece entitled \"Southern Whites\u0027 Loyalty to G.O.P. Nearing That of Blacks to Democrats.\"Michael P. McDonaldAssociate Professor, George Mason UniversityRather than attacking the institution of masculinity itself, several recent campaigns have attempted a sort of masculinity triage, trying to eliminate violence against women, while still flattering men with the label of protector.J.A. McCarrollWriter, anthropologist, and amateur bakerNot too long ago, environmental reform was a bipartisan, no-brainer issue. President Richard Nixon, a social conservative on many issues, established the Environmental Protection Agency. What happened?Robyn Camparo PurchiaFounder, EdenKeeper.orgThe longtime pattern of the U.S.-Iran relationship: spoilers never go away, they just regroup and try to despoil again and again.John TirmanExecutive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesThe Spanish government\u0027s willingness to consider offshore oil drilling, despite the ongoing climate crisis, is an ill-advised investment in fossil-fuel energy. It\u0027s out of line with European Union goals to reduce emissions and with the wishes of many Spaniards.Ted DansonAndrew SharplessThink about that -- if Don was not a donor, 50 people, including my little boy, would likely be living a very different life or would not have been able to sustain one.Heather ThomsonFounder and CCO, Yummie by Heather Thomson; Cast member, Real Housewives of New York City; Organ donation advocateWhat does it look like for campuses to have comprehensive, survivor-oriented sexual assault policies? There are key steps to creating safer campuses.Selena ShenTracey E. VitchersFor Christians, caring for God\u0027s creation should be a priority. It is not just a matter of science or politics, but an indication of our worship and praise of the Creator.Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIn her own words, girls \"Run The World,\" but at the same time, they can embrace their bodies, be proud to be \"Bootylicious,\" and sport a \"Freakum Dress\" if they\u0027re so inclined.Jessica SamakowNews Editor, HuffPost FamilyOver the last few years, there are even more examples of illustrated novels, some specifically for adult readers. So, novels with pictures are not just for kids anymore. And, actually, they never were.Josh FrankAuthorThese charts break down the proportion of time they spend on different activities more clearly.Lisa WadeProfessor of sociology based in Los AngelesAmericans represent less than 5 percent of the world\u0027s population, but we\u0027re responsible for 19 percent of the world\u0027s carbon emissions. Despite the fact that China surpassed us as the world\u0027s top carbon emitter in 2006, we\u0027re still the worst offenders per capita.Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned Scientists\"I am the product of my mother\u0027s rape.\" He spoke and moved at the same time. Like he wouldn\u0027t have said it unless he was moving.Katie KoestnerDirector, Take Back The Night FoundationSince 2010, a landfill fire has been moving toward 8,700 tons of unlined illegally dumped radioactive waste in Bridgeton, Missouri. The site is in the middle of working-class neighborhoods, right next to the Saint Louis airport, and near a hospital, schools and a great number of businesses.James P. HoffaGeneral President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersI\u0027ve been in a wheelchair since birth, so I\u0027ve never felt the kind of freedom that Sue once felt. If I had, I think I\u0027d be spending the rest of my life trying to regain something that was never in my grasp to begin with.Erin M. Kellywriter with Cerebral Palsy who wants to be recognized for her work rather than her disabilityIf you choose to forgo \"Happy Birthday\" for crooning about your \"Magic Stick,\" you\u0027d better be the guy in the Gandalf getup passing goodies out to the party-goers. You will NOT be \"making it rain\" around my girls unless you are a sprinkler technician.Mike HeenanDad, husband, author and Chief Content Creator at AtHomeDadMatters.comOne line of criticism holds that the DSM focuses too much on superficial symptoms of mental disorders, ignoring underlying dynamics. Instead of focusing on and naming clinical syndromes, critics say, the manual (and the field) ought to target the specific, disordered cognitive processes that underlie labels.Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027I\u0027m a gun responsibility advocate and I\u0027ll be attending the NRA Convention in Indianapolis this weekend. Sound like an oxymoron? Well, it shouldn\u0027t be.Rebecca BondCo-founder, EvolveBeing prepared for the job interview demonstrates to the employer that the job seeker is genuinely interested in the job. And, that preparation is often viewed by the employer as an example of the job seeker\u0027s work.Susan P. JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgThe senator doesn\u0027t pretend that being a woman has never been an issue for her (with its rich implication that there are no issues unless you\u0027re a troublemaker). Spooning out such happy hogwash isn\u0027t her style. Instead, Warren shares war stories, which is something that women do far too infrequently.Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027This time, the future isn\u0027t above us -- it\u0027s inside us.Jay S.
