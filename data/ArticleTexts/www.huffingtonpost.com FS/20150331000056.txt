{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027I\u0027ve argued that Hillary Clinton is at risk of being a weak presidential nominee -- on several counts. She seems like yesterday\u0027s news rather than tomorrow\u0027s. The excitement of a having a breakthrough woman president is blunted by the fact that her husband got there first. She will raise a ton of money from Wall Street, just like the Republican nominee, blurring differences and depressing turnout. Despite the absence of a formidable primary challenger (assuming Elizabeth Warren doesn\u0027t run), Clinton is likely to under-perform in the primaries. Still, she is likely to be the Democratic nominee. While it\u0027s good that Clinton is positioning herself as more of a progressive, I think she needs to be even more radical, both to generate real enthusiasm and to address America\u0027s real problems.In the wake of the financial crisis, President Obama took the helm of a sinking economic ship and help to right it. The unemployment rate is now once again at pre-recession levels -- the lowest in seven years (5.5%).Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistWorld leaders are close to an historic agreement that would roll back and contain Iran\u0027s nuclear program. In order for the deal to succeed, however, it must deliver on three core issues.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027It\u0027s a huge misgiving to solely place blame on \"suicidal tendencies\" during horrendous events like the Germanwings crash, because it conflates suicide with the intention to hurt other people.Healthy Living Editor, The Huffington PostSB 101 is based on hate; no matter how Governor Pence tries to sell it, he is teaching discrimination, he is enshrining inequality into Indiana law, and he is justifying segregation under a false flag in which liberty would have no part.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusCo-founder and Board President, Harvey Milk Foundation; nephew of Harvey MilkEvery day, men and women are released from prisons and jails across the U.S. after taking this same journey. Most incarcerated settings do not provide programs that teach relevant job skills for reentry to society. As a result, recidivism -- the rate at which people return to incarceration -- is enormous. Society blames these individuals for their failure. Had I not been fortunate enough to be a founding member of a program called The Last Mile, I too could have ended up back in prison.Manager of Campus Services at RocketSpaceLate Thursday night, after hearing of Harry Reid\u0027s plans to retire from elected office, Dick Durbin went to Chuck Schumer and told him that in order to prevent a divisive, distracting battle, he would not challenge Schumer for the leader position and would instead run again for his post of Democratic whip. That was classic Durbin.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe advantage of the notorious cover of Der Spiegel that showed Angela Merkel in front of the Acropolis surrounded by Nazi officers is that it finally poses, in a way that cannot be dodged, the question of Germanophobia in Europe.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The threats emanating from Yemen are distorted and exaggerated, the stakes are actually relatively low (except for Yemenis), any imposed settlement is highly elusive and the costs to those engaged may be high. For the U.S., it can be once again something of a lose-lose situation where the enemy of my enemy is often also my enemy.Former vice chairman, CIA’s National Intelligence CouncilThe Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by Governor Mike Pence last week, is one of the most biased pieces of state legislation we\u0027ve seen in our modern era. The fact that it is cloaked in the name of religious freedom is particularly offensive to me as a member of the clergy who has been engaged in ministry and social justice work my entire life.President, National Action NetworkLibya\u0027s collapse has been almost total. Alas, the consequences will linger for years if not decades. When war-happy politicians, including Hillary Clinton and her gaggle of Republican rivals, next stand before America, voters should hold these pitiful policymakers accountable for the disaster they created in Libya.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteRegardless of how you define it, we can agree that these familial connections exist in today\u0027s politics -- a 2016 presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush is very possible. How do you start building your political dynasty? Unfortunately, someone has to do the hard work and pave the road to a political office.Freshman, Yale UniversityMuch of the opposition to Mars exploration is based on disinformation and distraction tactics that imply or even claim outright that Mars would bust the budget or endanger Social Security, which, given actual budgetary facts and context, is preposterous.CEO, Explore MarsDirector of Political Outreach for Explore Mars.Maybe Governor Pence missed it in Sunday School, but Jesus -- who said absolutely nothing about LGBT people anywhere ever -- actually had an opinion on answering yes or no questions. It\u0027s in Matthew 5:37 and it\u0027s really very simple. Jesus said, \"Let your yes be yes and your no be no.\"Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has announced that he will not run for re-election. Reid has endorsed Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) to succeed him as Democratic leader.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicySucker punched by massive, illegally subsidized imports, American steel producers laid off thousands of workers in bedrock communities from Ohio and Illinois to Texas and Alabama. That\u0027s in just the past three months.International President, United SteelworkersMy mother’s favorite movie of the aughts is “The Descendants,” Shailene Woodley’s breakout transition from non-feminist fairy-nymph to full-fledged actor-person -- my mom was mistakenly referring to “Insurgent,” the “Divergent” sequel, as “Inception 2.”Books Editor, The Huffington PostThey\u0027ve cheated customers and defrauded investors. Now they want to use our legalized system of campaign-cash corruption to protect themselves from the very government that rescued them.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourI prayed as I walked in the door to a cold wife who barely even acknowledged me. That night, as we lay in our bed, inches from each other yet miles apart, the inspiration came. I knew what I had to do.AuthorRather than blame Latino voters -- Why was your turnout so low? Don\u0027t you care who wins?-- we should think about how well the candidates for office in 2014, did or did not make their case to Latino voters.Leader in Latino political opinion researchMillionaire bundlers for presidential candidates are feeling hurt that candidates, now more focused on billionaires, aren\u0027t courting them in the manner to which they are accustomed. And the angst of these millionaires is bipartisan. The ultimate pal for Wall Street and big money in the Democratic Party may fall to a crashing defeat: Rahm Emanuel is in real trouble.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersAs gobs and gobs of money in the form of campaign contributions keep congesting our elections, \"We the People of the United States\" are forced out of this crucial political process. If we want to reclaim our seats at the decision-making table we\u0027re going to have to stamp out Big Money.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgThere is little sign that America\u0027s key allies in this fight are paying attention to all of the elements of President Obama\u0027s multifaceted approach to countering violent extremism. The forthcoming Arab Summit will further expose these differences. That can only undermine the effectiveness of multilateral cooperation against ISIL.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstRemember that post-2012 RNC \"autopsy\" that was supposed to expand the party? Now comes contender Cruz who wants the base to vote, not grow. Ron Christie \u0026 Gara LaMarche debate whether he\u0027s the party\u0027s RX or poison. And has Baker\u0027s break with Bibi created a problem for \"Bush45\"?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Americans now understand what the Indiana \"Religious Freedom\" law was intended to do: legalize discrimination. Anti-gay bias and intent to discriminate are itself reasons to oppose the new law. But there\u0027s much more at stake. The organized Right is re-writing the Constitution and the impact will not be limited to gay Americans.Senior Fellow, DemosAs Hillary Clinton\u0027s email kerfuffle unfolded, several commentators wondered out loud who else might run for the Democratic nomination should Hillary\u0027s train derail -- a possibility greater than nil, given the Clinton\u0027s track-record. The party has no bench, these folks observed.Author/Professor, Ohio StateThe idea that there\u0027s plenty of money to pay the athletes a salary largely comes from the existing system of surrogate pay and superfluous expenditure that currently exists. If the athletes get salaries, then the coaches no longer get the proxy pay -- and one cost offsets the other.Author of \u0027Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and World Cup\u0027Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) is now apparently undecided how he\u0027ll buy insurance, backing away from his Obamacare announcement earlier in the week.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Some editors at the New York Times seem to have either developed a severe case of institutional amnesia, or decided to confer the presumption of innocence upon cellphone radiation, as the newspaper did upon asbestos for an entire decade after the mineral had been shown to be the most important industrial carcinogen in the world.Fmr. staff writer at The New YorkerJesus arrives as a gay man of today in a modern city with \"The Passion of Christ: A Gay Vision,\" a controversial series of paintings. The paintings and the new book that I wrote about them have been attacked as blasphemy by conservative Christians. But we refuse to concede Jesus to those who act like they own the copyright on Christ, then use him as a weapon to dominate others.Lesbian Christian author and art historianIt is your standards of happiness, love, values, personal development and responsibility that set your course in life.
