{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, historian, authorThe Republicans know the \"woman card\" well since they\u0027re the ones who invented it. They\u0027ve been playing it since 1984 when the Democrats nominated Geraldine Ferraro for vice president, the first woman to make it onto the ticket of a major American political party. The Republicans had to deal with the unprecedented event of the sitting vice president, George Herbert Walker Bush, debating the first-ever woman vice presidential candidate. Since 1984, the GOP has seen women as little more than adornments to be used as political slings and arrows. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are only the latest manifestation. If Hillary Clinton is the nominee the cunning Republican strategists are guaranteed to turn up the volume to eleven on their sexist attacks.

That\u0027s because you have to have enough savings from income to begin to accumulate wealth -- buying a house or investing in stocks and bonds, or saving up to send a child to college. But many Americans have almost no savings, so they have barely any wealth. Two-thirds live paycheck to paycheck.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Last night, 27 staff and patients were killed in an airstrike on Al Quds Hospital nearby.
