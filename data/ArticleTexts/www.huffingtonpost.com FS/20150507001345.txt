{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I just got back to New York after a deeply moving day mourning the passing and celebrating the life of Dave Goldberg. The whole day was a powerful reminder that our resumes have very little to do with our eulogies. As it happens, Dave had a very impressive resume. But there was barely a mention of any of this during the tributes, which were all about the other things: how he made people feel, his integrity, his essence, his humility, his honesty, how he always showed up for his friends, how much he meant to them and to his family, the small kindnesses, lifelong passions, and the things that made him laugh. The tributes were a powerful reminder of how easily we forget that often what we prioritize during our days is not what our eulogies will cover. And this is one more thing I\u0027m grateful to Dave for.It\u0027s hard for me to celebrate on Mother\u0027s Day. I feel the absence of my 23-year-old son, Sean Elijah Bell, who was killed on November 25, 2006. He was out celebrating at his own bachelor party with his friends in New York City. It was only a matter of a hours before his wedding, and I was so thrilled.Founder, Mothers of Never AgainTomorrow the polls will open and election day will finally be upon us. It has been a long campaign, but it all comes down to a simple choice: between a Labour government that puts working people first, or a Tory government that works only for the privileged few.Leader of the Labour Party and the Labour candidate for Doncaster NorthBritain\u0027s future is on a knife-edge. It would be a tragedy if we threw away all the hard work of the past five years and went back to square one. Together we can keep strengthening our economy, creating more jobs, investing in our health service, giving more young people a chance to get on in life.Prime Minister of Great Britain and Conservative candidate for WitneyLast year, Colorado voters defeated by a 2-1 margin a \"personhood\" amendment that aimed to outlaw all abortions and many forms of birth control. A similar bill in deep-red North Dakota also went down in flames at the ballot box. So that means that abortion rights are safe in America, right? Sadly, no.ActressPEPFAR continues to be crucial in the fight against HIV/AIDS because it addresses the global need for access to life-saving HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention medications. It\u0027s my hope that Congress holds steady in its commitment to PEPFAR, and ending this disease once and for all. Our work is not done.Founder of the Elton John AIDS FoundationWe should demand balance. Trade partners should agree to actually \"trade\" with us, not just sell to us. We should also balance the interests of working people, the environment and other stakeholders with the interests of businesses in our trade negotiations.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureA combination of field liners, floppy sprinklers and big data could reduce California agricultural water use by at least 75% -- while actually boosting yields and saving farmers a fortune on their water bill.New York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowWhat most people don\u0027t know is that the exclusion of home health care workers from fair pay is a deliberate and racist wrong that stretches back to Depression-era America, where it was written into our nation\u0027s labor law to accommodate Southern segregationists.Staff Attorney, American Civil Liberties Union Women\u0027s Rights ProjectMy recommendation that people vote Labour is an optimistic punt that the degeneration of Britain will be slowed down and the lives of the most vulnerable will be a little more bearable than they\u0027d\u0027ve been under the Tories. Nothing more ambitious than that.Actor and comedianThe bottom line is that the Republican budget fails to support families trying to create a better life for themselves and their children. It will exacerbate the economic hopelessness that is fueling unrest throughout the country rather than alleviate it.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaFor all the people who go through the process that I have, just remember, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Often times we have to create it ourselves but it\u0027s there.Cast member of Discovery Life Channel\u0027s \"New Girls on the Block.\"When news broke of the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal, I had just returned from my 20th trip to Haiti and was tragically reminded of what we faced in the early hours following the Haiti earthquake.General Counsel and Chief International Officer, American Red CrossRubio has been successful at selling his story. The same isn\u0027t true when it comes to advocating for those who want to follow his path. Since he ran for the U.S. Senate, Rubio has sought to portray himself as somehow both a Republican committed to real reform on immigration, and a darling of Tea Party extremists.U.S. Representative, Arizona\u0027s 7th Congressional District; Iraq War veteranWhile the OCO shenanigans were the most egregious example of irresponsible budgeting in the HASC bill, they were far from the only one. As usual, members added funding for items that the Pentagon didn\u0027t even ask for, in order to pay for a wide array of pet projects.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyYou feel emotions you haven\u0027t dare been in touch with, since gravity hit your breasts and grey hair started creeping in at your crown.

But we can create the ideal conditions for a long, restful night\u0027s sleep, and a comfortable morning wake up.Founder, Precision Nutrition, www.precisionnutrition.comOne would think that those who suffered persecution as much as the Jews would treat others with care and sensitivity. That the victim can become a victimizer is painful to face, but it is a reality nonetheless.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIt\u0027s legitimate to pose the question in just this way because it is clear that Huckabee wishes to make the case that his own candidacy best represents the way fundamentalist Christians read the Bible and see the world.Professor of Law, University of St. ThomasThe New York Times reported yesterday that Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner\u0027s chief political backer, Ken Griffin, made $1.3 billion last year as manager of the hedge fund Citadel Capital. Griffin made as much personally as 26,000 average Americans making the median wage.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIn our fast-paced, competitive culture, we tend to notice and worry about what\u0027s lacking in our lives. Feelings of insufficiency, imperfection and envy are known barriers to happiness. When we harbor these feelings, we limit our capacity for feeling fulfilled. But gratitude has powerful effects on health and well-being.Urban planner, healthy cities enthusiast, positive living bloggerDudes are allowed to have \"dadbods\" and be seen as cute for it precisely because their worth isn\u0027t as intrinsically tied to their appearance the way a woman\u0027s worth is.Writer and blogger, The Adventures of Ernie BuffloBritain is f*cked.
