{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundRight before the U.S. House of Representatives left for the summer to go home to campaign for your vote, they voted to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the richest Americans millionaires and billionaires. For more than ten years the richest 1 percent have received $750 billion from these tax cuts. Income and wealth inequality have grown astronomically, threatening the very fabric of our democracy. The top 1 percent in our nation now possesses more net worth than the bottom 90 percent combined. It\u0027s way past time to reset our moral and economic compass, demand a more just tax system where those with the most pay their fair share, and stop the reverse Robin Hood policies that take from the poor and young to give to the rich and powerful.Read Post | Comments (31)Jim Sleeper, 08/10/12Lecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityZakaria is a trustee of Yale, which takes a very dim view of plagiarism and suspends or expels students who commit anything like what he did.

And HuffPost\u0027s New York editor-at-large Dan Collins reports on a very different kind of mystery: the glamorous, lucrative and shamelessly corrupt world of wine counterfeiting.Read Post | Comments (13)Howard Fineman, 08/09/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupVeep vetting is going public -- even viral -- which means a decision Mitt Romney thought he was making in private could be influenced, or undermined, by a parallel search going on beyond his headquarters in Boston.Read Post | Comments (835)Erica Berman, 08/10/12PhDIt seems no woman in her 20s, 30s or even 40s -- not even celebrities -- can have a belly bulge the size of a grape without someone speculating she is pregnant.Read Post | Comments (36)Jonathan Weiler, 08/10/12Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillThe Romney campaign\u0027s particularly scurrilous and misplaced attack against Obama on the issue of welfare is more likely to serve as another reminder of Romney\u0027s inability to speak relevantly to the concerns of typical Americans than anything else.Read Post | CommentsLaura Carroll, 08/10/12Author and Communications ConsultantWhen it comes to the \"biological urge,\" it\u0027s time to shift our thinking to reflect what is real.Read Post | Comments (215)Tom Zeller Jr., 08/10/12What ordinary Americans really want is for honest brokers on both sides to detoxify and depoliticize the global warming conversation, and then get on with the business of addressing it.Read Post | Comments (33)Michael B.
