{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027There was a bit of good news from Europe last week. Two of the nations that desperately need some respite from austerity essentially told German Chancellor Merkel to stuff it. France, under pressure from Germany and the European Union to meet the E.U.\u0027s straightjacket requirement of deficits of no more than three percent of GDP (whether or not depression looms) informed the E.U. that they will not hit this target until 2017. The government of President Francois Hollande, under fire for failing to ignite a recovery, now plans economic stimulus measures -- and the target be damned. Under E.U. rules, France can be fined up to 0.2 percent of its GDP. The French seem to be saying, \u0027So sue us!\u0027As a gay man who has been with my partner for almost 13 years and married for almost two, it felt nice to hear these two Christian groups making an effort towards gay people. But the feeling didn\u0027t last long.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostOne of the most insidious, and perhaps ultimately one of the most dangerous, manifestations of neo-Nazi resurgence may well be its steady subversive infiltration of contemporary popular and consumer culture.Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsWriter, Communications ConsultantThe conversation about privilege threatens to cut off the legs of the feminist movement before it can even crawl (yes -- crawl, we\u0027re in 2014 and birth control is seen by many as a dirty word.) Privilege is weighing us down. By us I mean all of us -- all feminists.Host and producer, HuffPost LiveMedical Correspondent, CBS Evening News with Scott PelleyI had the good fortune to become the first African-born General Manager in American sports, a blessed example of someone given an opportunity. But as fortunate as I have been, I\u0027d be a failure if I couldn\u0027t provide opportunities to the next generation.President \u0026 General Manager of the Toronto RaptorsThe real reason that the gunnies want to push physicians out of the discussion about gun violence is because the NRA and its allies want to disconnect gun ownership from violence to make their products more acceptable, more enjoyable, more normal for every dad and mom.Mike the Gun GuyStatistically, black women are more likely to die of breast cancer than white women, even though more white women are diagnosed with it. Heartbreakingly, one of the reasons for this is fear.Founder and Spokesperson, PinkChoseMe FoundationNow before the liberal left and cynical political observers fall off their chairs laughing, consider this isn\u0027t just wishful thinking from Rand Paul. If there\u0027s anybody in the 2016 Republican field with even a puncher\u0027s chance of pulling this off, it\u0027s Paul.Professor of Political Science at Hiram College and author of the book \u0027Political Consultants and Campaigns: One Day to Sell\u0027The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, should call into being a new party, born of the Nation\u0027s awakened sense of justice, dedicated to maintain government of the people, by the people and for the people.Political theorist - Founding Director \"Civic Inquirer\" - author of \"Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\" \u0026 \"Abandoned To Ourselves\"The claims coming from the mouths of our elected representatives showcase an incredibly wide array of pseudo-scientific criticism directed at the contemporary understanding of climate change.Former Director, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyA Republican Senate is pretty much an iron-clad guarantee of the return of \"fiscal cliffs\" and \"government shutdowns\" and \"hostage-taking\" and all the rest of the budgetary games Republicans are known for playing.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWith so little known about the Ebola virus, as a public health decision, it may be prudent to extend the quarantine or observation period.Physician and WriterIndictment for criminal acts should not be directed at one particular religion. The ultimate culprit is our human natures -- individual and social. Or, if you prefer, the Heavenly Father who created such conflicted and flawed creatures.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAs the leaders of the umbrella movement sit down to negotiate with Hong Kong authorities after weeks of street protests, the big question is whether the two sides can find a compromise that meets both Beijing\u0027s concerns about stable and efficient governance on the one hand, and citizens\u0027 concerns about genuine, instead of sham, democracy on the other.Editor-in-chief, THEWORLDPOSTIt is now possible for insurgent, anti-establishment candidates to raise a ton of money from small donors online, and to use that money, plus the Internet, plus old-fashioned organizing, to build nationwide, strong volunteer organizations -- all without any help from either of the idiot parties.Electoral College DropoutWhile it is true that, by far, the overwhelming percentage of black people in the South were doomed to spend their entire lives in slavery prior to the Civil War, it is also true that a small percentage lived as free citizens. And some were even able to prosper.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityGenealogist and senior product manager at Ancestry.comThis gay man wants us to co-sign these anti-gay bakers\u0027 hate because of some misguided mumbo-jumbo about love and acceptance. I\u0027d like to humbly suggest that we not do that.Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesIs it possible that aggregate Twitter patterns might also be revealing in some useful way? Could Twitter offer snapshots of communities as well as individuals? A team of scientists has been exploring this possibility.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Director Laura Poitras, like reporter Glenn Greenwald, is now known almost as widely as Edward Snowden himself, for helping facilitate his entry into the world. Her new film takes you back to June 2013 and locks you in that Hong Kong hotel room. It\u0027s a riveting, surprisingly unclaustrophic, and unforgettable experience.Editor, TomDispatch.comThe CDC isn\u0027t infallible, but they don\u0027t pull numbers out of the air, either; they\u0027re scientists, and their guidelines come from evidence.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorForeign languages help free us from ethnocentrism, the delusion that we alone are the measure of all things human, and they connect us to a larger, saner, more humane world.Retired high-school teacherLast Monday I was arrested in Ferguson, Missouri, along with dozens of other clergy, seminarians, and people of many faith traditions. As a white, middle-aged, married, mother of three and a rule-abiding Presbyterian, this was a new experience for me.Professor of Theology, Louisville SeminaryCharter schools, the modern version as represented by K12 and Success Academies, are not public schools at all. If they really want to earn the \"public\" label, they need to meet these four requirements.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comForcing voters to use photo ID and perpetuating the myth of rampant voter fraud is nothing more than a strategy to keep growing minority communities on the sidelines. And unfortunately, it works.Latino Victory ProjectWith continued officer-involved shootings, attempts at voter suppression, and ongoing racial and economic disparities, it is easy to push voting to the side. But it is precisely because of tragedies like the deaths of young Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in Staten Island, and because of an unequal educational and employment system, that we need to show up at the polls.President, National Action NetworkThe teasing from his teammates started slowly, but then one day some boys on his team pants\u0027d him by pulling down Ben\u0027s pants on the playing field, in front of the whole team.Advocate for people with intellectual disabilities, Special Olympics volunteerOur nation boasts the most advanced healthcare system in the world. We have the capacity and know-how to address this public health issue. If we listen to the voices of our nurses and health professionals, we can keep our communities safe and healthy.President, American Federation of TeachersTonight, I\u0027m joined by Kristen Stewart who is continuing her commitment to independent films with her latest movie, Camp X-Ray, in which she delivers a strong, nuanced performance as a young, inexperienced MP assigned to Gitmo.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorIntroducing for-profit companies into America\u0027s criminal justice system has been a bad deal for governments across the country.Chair, In the Public InterestGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"DE BLASIO AND GIULIANI IN OPERA SHOWDOWN",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
