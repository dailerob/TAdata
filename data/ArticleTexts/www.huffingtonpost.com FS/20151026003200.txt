{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Joe Biden said no, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee said no more, while Hillary Clinton endured 11 hours of Benghazi hearings aimed more at finding attack ad soundbites than facts. Meanwhile, Paul Ryan threw his hat into the ring for Speaker, but only after telling his House-mates, \"I cannot and will not give up my family time.\" Bravo! It\u0027s a big moment when a political leader says that when he\u0027s about to take a big job rather than as a euphemism for being fired. Now Ryan should work to make it possible for all Americans to experience more family time. In the past, Ryan has opposed paid family leave, allowing America to remain the world\u0027s only developed country without it. So, as he seeks to unify the GOP caucus, he should also fight for family-friendly policies at a time when the country really needs them.I believe it is wrong, and, yes, un-American, to say that a person\u0027s faith is a disqualifying factor, the same way it was wrong when some Americans declared that John F. Kennedy could not be trusted to be president because he was Catholic.Founder, People for the American WayI want Hillary Clinton for president. The only thing that will satisfy me after the great run of our historic first African American is a smart, tough, unflappable woman. She will make one hell of a president. In fact, she might be one of our best.Actress and authorLast Tuesday, five Democrats took the stage in the party\u0027s first national debate. There were differences no doubt. But what was striking was how much they agreed upon? -- ?if not in what they said, at least in what they ignored.Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentJoin us for a conversation, sparked by Jeremy Rifkin\u0027s series on the \"Third Industrial Revolution,\" on climate change, technology and the growing global movement toward solutions.Among previous generations of retirees, mailing a check to a worthy cause was standard operating procedure. Not anymore. The new generation of retirees wants to be more focused in their giving choices, make a strong impact, and apply their talent and skills to improve the world.Gerontologist, psychologist, author, entrepreneur and public speakerGirls reading books are a greater threat to men wielding guns than other men with guns: in the 1980s, only half of girls in developing countries completed elementary school; now, 80 percent do.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersMigrants are innovative and entrepreneurial. In the 19th century a third of the population of Sweden, Ireland and Italy emigrated to America and other countries. The U.S. is the very best example of how dynamic a country of immigrants can be.Activist, Pussy Riot band memberThis propaganda and the money that propelled it has polluted our entire political system. Look into almost any organization (or political party) promoting \"limited government\" and complaining about \"burdensome government regulation\" and you will find oil money.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIn the fall of 1995, I met the man of my dreams. The only problem was, he had a cat. To protect this cat\u0027s identity, let\u0027s call him Stanley. Now, I want to be clear: I love cats, but my allergies do not, and I was confident that bouts of hives and phlegm were no way to start a relationship.Creator, Moomah the MagazineThe events of 9/11 changed everything. Because the United States had designated the PKK a terrorist organization in 1997 -- six years after Ibrahim had come to the United States -- the Bush administration denied his naturalization petition and initiated deportation proceedings against him.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of Chicago\"Tell the people in America that you don\u0027t have to send us any more shoes,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t have to send us any more money. What you need to do is talk to someone who is a refugee. You need to understand this problem for yourself.\"Actor and ProducerVotes over the CFPB present the same choice today that they always have -- a choice between big banks and predatory lenders on one side and families on the other. It\u0027s time to say no to the big banks and no to their lobbyists, their lawyers and their Republican friends in Congress.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsNational flags are a mark of pride and patriotism in every country around the world. But there is only one flag that belongs to all of us. That blue flag of the United Nations was a banner of hope for me growing up in wartime Korea.Secretary-General, United NationsMy oldest son is 16 and his life does not need to be threatened when he takes his date out for dinner. My son is 16 and yet he has enough sense to be respectful to his grandmother, his mother, his sisters, and, amazingly, his girlfriend.Writer, mother, eater-of-Oreos. Not necessarily in that order.Voters woke up on Tuesday morning to find that the most powerful people in their government were all under 45. The boomers no longer control Canada.Columnist for Esquire Magazine and the author of The Hunger of the Wolf.Here\u0027s how the rise of the \"Internet of Things,\" the \"Sharing Economy\" and the \"Zero Marginal Cost Society\" can save the planet and create new jobs.Author, \u0027The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism\u0027A plethora of child care legislation has been passed over the past four decades but programs are still available to only a fraction of the children who need them. The quality of care provided to our children in their early years remains very inadequate, especially for the poorest children.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundObama has \"DirectTV,\" Carson has \"cable,\" and apparently, the American people have no class. Just because these women have husbands that have chosen a life in the public eye, serving the public, does not make them fair game for sexist jokes and offensive comparison.| iowan | cyclone | grammar nerd | listener of audio books | feminist | political junkie | cat mom || farmer’s daughter | Gemini \u0026 real-life twinRubio\u0027s panders abound. But what marks this callow candidate -- and the shame of Citizens United -- is his willingness to delegate his views on vital foreign policy issues to an ignorant and imperious donor.Novelist and contributing opinion writerNoise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an epidemic in the U.S. The American Academy of Audiology (AAA) reports that by second grade almost three times as many children have hearing loss today as compared to just a decade ago, increasing to four times as many by eighth grade.Founder, Ear Peace: Save Your Hearing FoundationThe problem is that, to a large degree, it seems that American intellectuals -- particularly those in academia -- have fallen out of love with freedom of speech.President, Foundation for Individual Rights in EducationDonald Trump has opened the floodgates to lies about immigration. Here are the myths, and the facts.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027You will feel completely lost that first night you bring your baby home -- and scared, too.

You are bringing magic into the world of a child, one teal pumpkin at a time.Founder of The No Nut TravelerIn the United States, one in five households are underbanked, meaning that while they may have a checking account, they also rely on a network of predatory financial service providers (such as check cashers, payday lenders, auto title lenders, etc) to make ends meet.Communications Director, United for a Fair EconomyOur democracy\u0027s decisions should reflect voter views. But we are using a bad system: essentially \"name one candidate, then shut up.\" Political scientists call that the \"plurality system.\" That\u0027s a flawed system for evaluating true popular sentiment.Fmr. president of The Center for Election ScienceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
