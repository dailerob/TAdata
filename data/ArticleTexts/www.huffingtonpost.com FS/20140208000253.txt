{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe nation\u0027s payrolls grew by 113,000 last month, once again dashing analysts\u0027 expectations for a stronger month of job growth and reinforcing the possibility of yet another slowdown in job creation. A closely watched piece of this puzzle was the revision to December\u0027s surprisingly low payroll number -- originally 74,000. But today\u0027s revision left that paltry number essentially unchanged, at 75,000. November\u0027s payroll gain, on the other hand, was raised by 33,000 to 274,000, bringing the average gain over the past three months to about 150,000 compared to about 200,000 per month over the prior three months. Last month, I stressed that one month does not a trend make. Today, I\u0027ll stress that two months does not quite a trend make either, but the possibility that the U.S. job creation engine has once again downshifted cannot be rejected out of hand.Comments (82)Kathleen AnnFreelance writer from New EnglandI\u0027m not a \"Never Had.\" I know what it\u0027s like to pay bills on time and have a little left over. I remember vacations and pedicures and going out to dinner. As a \"Used-to-Have,\" I know exactly what Corporate America, lobbyists and politicians have taken away from me.Comments (1,004)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageMost Americans are on a downward escalator. Median household pay is dropping, adjusted for inflation. A smaller share of working-age Americans are in jobs than at any time in the last three decades.Comments (41)David WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Everybody\u0027s Brother\u0027I never met John Lennon. \"You would have loved him,\" Ringo told me once casually, and I had to laugh. The truth is I have loved John Lennon all of my life.Comments (32)Adlai E. Stevenson IIIFmr. member, U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee; Chairman, Adlai Stevenson Center on DemocracyThe debate over the NSA\u0027s data collection should lead to a better balance between rights of privacy and requirements of foreign intelligence. But whatever the outcome of that debate, it has failed to acknowledge inherent deficiencies and risks in \"foreign intelligence\" and the transcendent role of foreign policy in the defense of our national interests.Comments (24)Ada PollaCo-creator, Alchimie ForeverMaybe it is because we are 1/12th done with 2014 already. Maybe it is because in 8 months I will be unarguably closer to 40 than to 30. Who knows... in any case, I have been thinking about what I long for.CommentsJeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"The discretionary civilian budget -- the part that looks after your and your children\u0027s future other than social security, health, and emergency support -- is disappearing. What about America\u0027s future scientific and technological leadership? What about America\u0027s role in fighting climate change and promoting clean energy through new R\u0026D? Forget about it.Comments (151)Daniel GrossPresident, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun ViolenceThis isn\u0027t a gun issue. It\u0027s a responsibility issue. Thousands of tragedies, in homes across our country, could be prevented if parents and others had more responsible attitudes and behaviors about the real risks of guns in the home.CommentsOliver EmbertonEntrepreneur, writer, programmer and artistYou might not realize, but real life is a game of strategy. There are some fun mini-games -- like dancing, driving, running, and sex -- but the key to winning is simply managing your resources.CommentsMensenBrooklyn-based muralist, public artist and community facilitatorFind something that makes you feel like the world makes sense. Personally, if I don\u0027t get up, get laid, get down on a dance floor, read a good book, write a poem, listen to a mind-blowing record or have a soul-shaking, satisfying conversation at least once a week, the world doesn\u0027t make sense to me and I am unmoored.CommentsHarold BronsonCo-founder, Rhino Records labelAlthough the Beatles\u0027 records demonstrated a high degree of musical proficiency and exuberance, they weren\u0027t explicitly comedic. So where did the humor come from?CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Lynne Peeples travels to the Celilo Indian Village in Oregon, where the push for a coal-export superhighway is a growing concern for the local Native American community.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsReagan\u0027s economic legacy is one of failure, but in another way it could be argued that he was genuinely transformative: as the first celebrity politician for the modern corporate state.Comments (31)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIf the law is to be understood and obeyed, it must be public information. How can we follow the law if we don\u0027t know what it is? This is the astonishingly unfortunate reality for a large number of our nation\u0027s laws.CommentsPeter H. GleickPresident, Pacific InstituteThe costs of drought vary widely from sector to sector, and often include things that are hard to measure or to quantify. It is difficult to report on drought costs in a comprehensive or consistent way. And until a drought ends, it is impossible to know the ultimate costs.CommentsMelody Lynn HoffmannProfessor of Communication Studies at Gustavus Adolphus College; Transportation equity advocateFraming the story as \"safe bicyclist still dies\" rather than \"drunk driver kills bicyclist\" continues to highlight the necessity for bicyclists to prove that they do not deserve their injuries or death.CommentsRob ReinaldaWriter, 28 years in print journalismDo you enter your PIN number at the ATM machine? Well, stop it. PIN stands for personal identification number. ATM stands for automated teller machine.CommentsShitika AnandLondon-based freelance journalistPulling an all-nighter for a hot date with MS Word and an avalanche of scribbled paperwork is much more lucrative than a sweaty session on your black satin sheets. Sorry, but not sorry.CommentsTerry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenLaws that restrict or deny access to reproductive health care procedures are openly discriminatory against women. How many lawmakers do you know who have dreamed up restriction after restriction after restriction to block men\u0027s access to vasectomy?Comments (15)Michael KeeganPresident, People For the American WayThe bashers of big government aren\u0027t really against government in any form. They\u0027re fine with the government that they want; they just don\u0027t want one that serves all of us.CommentsScott ShigeokaDigital storytellerI scraped by living in Washington, D.C., one of the most expensive cities in America, for nearly eight months with no steady income. I kept telling myself, \"This is the city of opportunity. You can make this work.\"Comments (11)Kathreen KhavariActor, writer\"Brain of Terror\" is about a woman who binges on episodes of Showtime\u0027s popular series Homeland, then dreams that she\u0027s terrorist, prompting her subconscious to panic.CommentsLincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comThe leap between being surprised on Election Night in 2012 and believing climate change is a hoax is not that big. In both cases, eschewing scientific approaches leads to fundamental misunderstandings of reality.Comments (132)James MooreBest selling author, TV political analystI know politics is all about compromise. I know we sometimes have to settle for not getting everything we want in a candidate. But there are some things I refuse to accept in a potential leader. Pandering to the right to support Open Carry Laws fits in that category. I\u0027m sitting out this Texas gubernatorial election.Comments (64)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveWhat we learned in 1971 is essentially the same thing we learned from the Snowden documents. The federal government is conducting illegal surveillance on Americans. Edward Snowden is a whistleblower. He is a patriot.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsRichard BrodskySenior Fellow, DemosFor anyone with an interest in politics or government, the unfolding saga of Bridgegate is mesmerizing. What has escaped any real analysis is the question of what the New York-New Jersey Port Authority actually does and how it affects real people every day.CommentsMarshall FineAuthor and film critic, hollywoodandfine.comI don\u0027t want to make too big a deal about Bob Dylan appearing in a Chrysler commercial during the Super Bowl and yet, I\u0027m afraid, it is a big deal.Comments (15)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostDrug addiction isn\u0027t just about the pleasure of getting high. It is also the story of untreated depression and mental illness. Through his career, Hoffman battled doubts and depression.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerIn this time of provocative and suggestive \"quenelles\" and bananas hurled at government officials, of rancid hatred and incendiary clamor, of generalized resentment and vindictive rivalries, we have forgotten a word that badly needs reinventing. That word is fraternity.CommentsSeporah RaizerCancer is not a competition. Oh, well, it is if you ask Official Pancreatic Action -- their latest ad campaign features a picture of a woman, with a bald head (presumably from chemo), and next to her is a quote, \"I wish I had breast cancer.\"CommentsRita Anya Nara, 2014. 7.02Vicki Cobb, 2014. 7.02Leila Lewis, 2014. 7.02Erika Trautman, 2014. 7.02Leslie Rasmussen, 2014. 7.02Michael Gene Sullivan, 2014. 7.02Luc Bergevin, 2014. 7.02Corinne Futch, 2014. 7.02Kari Ansari, 2014. 7.02Spencer Critchley, 2014. 7.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"RUSSIAN TV DOCTORS OPENING CEREMONY!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
