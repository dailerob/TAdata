Her remark is an apt credo for a party leadership that has spent the last quarter-century serving corporate power as persistently as it spews out empty rhetoric about \"the needs of working families.\" Back then, it was a minor controversy that Hillary Clinton had represented a shifty S\u0026L.

Then think what you would want our government to do.President, National Action NetworkThe federal government is one of the world\u0027s biggest consumers. These hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases and investments are a driving force of the American economy -- procurement creates jobs, promotes innovation and even has socially beneficial effects. It also is often associated with outsourcing waste and fraud and crony capitalism.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIt is striking to see how the establishment types are willing to throw out all their rules and principles in order to secure re-authorization.

My work did not cost the taxpayers a dime.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027The corporate system -- which seems increasingly unmoored from any values other than power and profit -- is working systematically to shift power and wealth from average Americans to itself, i.e. to the mightiest and richest powers in our society.Award-winning author, political commentator, and talk radio philosopher; Democratic nominee for Congress in VA-06If you\u0027re online, if you use a smartphone, you\u0027re an experimental subject in proprietary research studies of how best to target, engage and monetize you.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorThe European Union is suffering from a malaise.

Its symptoms are flagging confidence and anxiety about its future viability.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe majority of publicly traded Indian companies -- 922 of 1,462 -- have no women on their boards. But there is good news at the lower ranks -- and it will give India a major advantage in the future.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurOne thing that\u0027s great about short stories is how quickly they can ruin your life. This happens whether you like it or not. Great stories practice this violent beauty on you in a variety of ways.Author, \u0027Elegy on Kinderklavier\u0027Providing a safe place for girls and women to pursue their education is the best vehicle we know for combating poverty, disease and economic injustice. The demand that girls and women have a right to a full and equal education is not a parochial Western value -- it is a fundamental human right.President, Wesleyan UniversityLeBron James is not rejecting the glitz and glamour that we shower on the world\u0027s greatest basketball player, but he is allowing another value to enter into the mix, something bigger than cash, championships, and fame: the value of community.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteOh good, you \"live life to the fullest.\" Now I know everything I need to know in order to swipe right...Journalist, blogger, rugby player and college student, while maintaining sobriety.Today, the U.S. looks less like a functioning and effective empire than an imperial basket case, unable to bring its massive power to bear effectively from Germany to Syria, Iraq to Afghanistan, Libya to the South China Sea, the Crimea to Africa.Editor, TomDispatch.comFortunately, after spending the last four weeks in Brazil doing impact work in the local communities, I\u0027ve learned one very important thing: Brazil is more than football.Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Executive Officer of Uncharted Play, Inc.The automatic instinct to blame Israel, while still there, is diminishing in favor of a more nuanced approach -- one which is based on the true interests of some countries in the Middle East, which places the Palestinians and their problems much lower in the list of priorities than ever before.The havoc wreaked by drug gangs in Central America could be mitigated to a great degree by legalizing marijuana as well, which would alleviate the current border crisis of desperate children seeking refuge in the U.S.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications.Wil is not typical because he has 47 chromosomes, while all the other children in his classroom have 46.
