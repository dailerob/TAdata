{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressIs there a chance that you might be among those who could find yourself in need of guidance come tax time this year? Because the news, it is not good. That\u0027s the takeaway from a report from National Taxpayer Advocate Nina E. Olson, presented to Congress. In that report Olson describes the IRS as an agency that\u0027s been slowly \"crippled by five years of budget cuts,\" leading to this looming, Comcastian customer service nightmare. Especially harmful was the infamous sequestration, wrought by the misguided Budget Control Act of 2011, which dinged the IRS\u0027 budget to the tune of $597 million and led to this gradual degradation in services.According to a Blacademy spokesperson, \"It\u0027s not that white actors weren\u0027t good enough ... It\u0027s just that there were a lot of great performances by black actors this year. In fact, some very good black actors weren\u0027t even nominated. That\u0027s how you know it\u0027s not a race issue.\"Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityWriter and filmmakerEven if the country would eventually get to national recognition of marriage equality through the democratic process -- and that is a big \"if\" -- the Court is doing its duty by stepping in now.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterWhile the intent of \u0027Yes Means Yes\u0027 is admirable -- and certainly more communication about and around sex is not a bad thing -- government seeking to regulate sex, or any other act, on such a micro level is a symptom of a culture marked by extreme over-parenting -- and it is dangerously enabling.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarI grew up with a stutter. Does this mean I shouldn\u0027t have pursued journalism because I stutter? Does this mean I shouldn\u0027t conduct interviews, speak up in meetings or ask questions when I want more clarification?Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityThe recent attacks in Paris were gruesome and tragic, but what\u0027s been said and done in the aftermath is enough to make one want to bury their head in the sand and hope to never resurface. Where to begin?Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveMy son turns 14 today. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s wishing for all sorts of stuff: an Xbox, Beats headphones, maybe even good grades. However, my wish for my son on his 14th birthday is much more fundamental. I wish for him to be able to walk to the grocery store without being harassed or gunned down. I wish for him to live.Founder and managing director, Keating AdvisorsAfter he signed the Voting Rights Act, I asked LBJ if he thought this meant we\u0027d have a black president in our time. He said no, we would have a woman first. Well, one down, another to go.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThis is what they choose to prioritize in the first week. No matter what kind of plans or \"autopsies\" or happy talk comes out of this winter retreat, one thing\u0027s clear: the GOP\u0027s priorities are more outrageous than ever.Communications Director, EMILY\u0027s ListIn his recent words on the issue, Obama is dead right. But having spent the past decade focusing on these issues, I\u0027m not ready to take a \"Birdman\" victory lap through the canyons of midtown Manhattan just yet.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911We were young, in love and ready for marriage when we said yes in our early twenties. But that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean we were prepared.Reclaiming meaning in the things that matter most in business, wellness and home. Blogger at JustinRicklefs.com. Husband to Brooke.

But the Credit Suisse story does not end there.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorWith today\u0027s SCOTUS announcement we are entering what we hope will be the last phase of a journey toward greater dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, and bisexual people that started decades ago and has accelerated at a truly astounding rate over the last year and a half. A win before the high court would be a watershed moment for the LGBT-rights movement.Director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender \u0026 AIDS ProjectIs it too much to ask Jenny McCarthy to read a simple, well-researched article and properly educate herself about how no legitimate scientific studies have linked vaccines to autism? And then, to announce to the world she was wrong? It would help undo at least some of the damage she\u0027s done to public health and our country\u0027s children.Activist and political blogger at LatestOutrage.orgI\u0027m 22, I\u0027ve never consumed a legal drink and I never plan to, for better and worse. Being in recovery at any age elicits both challenges and rewards, but being young and at a pivotal, sometimes confusing point in life even without worrying about sobriety makes said challenges and rewards even more prominent.Journalist, blogger, rugby player and college student, while maintaining sobriety.Unlike those of the other possible candidates of the GOP establishment, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, Romney\u0027s positions on gays have been more defined and extreme -- and more consistent and reiterated much more recently, especially since he veered far right in the primaries in 2012. Any change will be seen as a yet another major flip-flop.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn last week\u0027s New York Times, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel suggested that this year\u0027s resolution might be to abandon the ritual of your annual physical. The title of his column, perhaps chosen by an editor to maximize glibness and thus provocation was: \"Skip your annual physical.\" But permit me to suggest you don\u0027t commit to that just yet.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThere\u0027s a weird and disconcerting trend that I\u0027ve noticed in the past few weeks. Women are being erased. From boardrooms to politics -- and this month, history.Host and producer, HuffPost LiveLike most people, I too have been blindsided by life\u0027s curve balls that at times have left me feeling battered, despondent, and alone. And through all that, no matter how far I\u0027ve fallen or how high I\u0027ve rebounded, running -- my constant companion -- has never left my side.Writer ~ Speaker ~ AthleteThe challenge is knowing when to tell your child that the world looks at you differently, that it isn\u0027t fair, and that your very life may be in danger because of what you look like.

There is little doubt that high recidivism rates across the country continue to impact public safety negatively with new offenses and new social harms.Associate Professor, Texas Southern University - Thurgood Marshall School of LawThe Australian government has granted an oil company the rights to search for oil and gas in the middle of a breathtaking marine ecosystem. That means millions of sea creatures will be killed by incessant sonic booms as Big Oil scavenges for more heat-trapping gases.Broadcaster, Conservation BiologistFew pixels and little ink went to the witness just before Rice -- former CIA spokesman William Harlow -- whose testimony stumbled into indicating why he thought of Sterling early on in connection with the leak, which ultimately resulted in a ten-count indictment.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027I am that mom, and these are strangely some of the most sacred moments of parenting. When it isn\u0027t easy -- but it\u0027s still so good. When God reveals himself to me through my boys.
