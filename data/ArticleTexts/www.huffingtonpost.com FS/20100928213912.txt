{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Reports indicate that President Obama is looking to replace Larry Summers as director of the National Economic Council with a corporate CEO to mollify Wall Street. Really? At this late date in the recession and with the midterms shaping up as they are, the president can take in the economic landscape and conclude that what most needs repairing is his administration\u0027s relationship with Wall Street?
