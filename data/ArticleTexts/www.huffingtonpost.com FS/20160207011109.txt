{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorThe next pivotal point in American politics is custom-built for protest candidates. That, as much as anything, explains why Sen. Bernie Sanders and scaremongering billionaire Donald Trump are leading in New Hampshire primary polls by wide margins. At the same time, the biggest risk for Sanders and Trump is that the conventional wisdom says they will win. New Hampshire hates to ratify the conventional wisdom. Nowhere else in America is as suspicious of any and all establishments, as dedicated to its own vast array of local officeholders, and as resistant to being told what to do or think by Washington, Wall Street or national media bloviators.The stunning ascent of Bernie Sanders portends far more than a hard-fought Democratic primary. Its greater implication, whether Sanders wins or loses, is that America\u0027s crony capitalism will no longer go unchallenged.Of course candidates have to deny that they listen to Wall Street, and flatter voters into thinking ordinary people\u0027s opinions about high finance and economic fairness really matter. But of course most candidates also suppose that ordinary people don\u0027t understand banking and that bankers do.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Black wellness is the physiological resource that made the historical examples of liberation above possible. Be it by food, ceremony, or institutionalizing our healing practices, Black wellness asks us not only to believe in self-determination politically, but to imbue that belief with the raw material that makes the self feel vibrantly worth determining.Director of Health and Wellness at Dignity and Power NowIt is not a double standard to criticize Israel, and it is most certainly not anti-Semitic. In fact, the overreaction to criticism harms our political discourse, damages the effort to combat real anti-Semitism, and because it serves to enable destructive Israeli policies, it makes a just peace a near unattainable goal.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027It was saddening to learn of the latest NFL great to have suffered from the illness, but not shocking. Hall of Famers Frank Gifford and Junior Seau are just two of a growing list of former players who developed the disease, as confirmed the only way now possible -- through an autopsy.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.As Black girls in a high school in Newark, NJ made clear to me, the anxieties around power, citizenship, and protection they arouse within and outside of an imagined monolithic Black community reveals more about our oppressively flawed and dehumanizing social order than it does about the category \"black girl.\"Cultural anthropologist, movement artist, and associate chair of African and African American Studies at Fordham University.When it comes to mental illness, the problem isn\u0027t how we describe those who suffer but how we as individuals ultimately choose to view them, which is just that: a choice. Instead of renaming the conversation, how about reframing the entire body of thought around the topic?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarSome go to Super Bowl parties for the game, others for the commercials -- but everyone looks forward to the food. From Tailgate Sliders to White Chicken Chili and Guacamole, these crowd-pleasing recipes will make you the MVP of the party.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomBryan Stevenson is unwavering in that vision and in lifting his voice of great moral clarity at the forefront of the struggle. Every new hard-earned and overdue victory should remind us all that we must keep moving towards greater justice for all.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundInquiring voters and Bernie Sanders now have an opportunity to make transparency an important matter of candidate accountability and believability. Otherwise, manipulative and deceptive rhetoric holds sway.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorBernie Sanders\u0027 campaign has already accomplished what most observers thought was impossible. This campaign is a rare, perhaps unprecedented event in this country\u0027s modern electoral history. It deserves the support of everyone who favors social and economic justice.Actor, producer and humanitarianHillary Clinton finds it \"amazing\" that Iowa young female voters preferred Bernie Sanders. It\u0027s a bitter pill to for Secretary Clinton. But beyond the matter of personal choice, there are some reasons that are both natural and inevitable in our society.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Hillary Clinton is not the first progressive Democratic woman to be challenged by Bernie Sanders. It\u0027s difficult to find that sweet spot where a woman is \"just right\" tough enough to be commander in chief and feminine enough to be mother of the nation.First Female Governor of Vermont; Marsh Scholar, University of VermontI\u0027m a big fan of hope. I\u0027ve stood on the edge of some grim and horrific precipices, and managed to avoid falling into them because of hope. I\u0027ve experienced injustices and cruelty, and survived, even thrived, because of hope.Journalist/ProducerVeterans realize the VA has its issues - but they also realize that these issues are fixable, and understand that privatizing the VA only makes things worse.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranTwitter has proven to be Trump\u0027s most powerful weapon in this election. By eliminating the filters of traditional political fact-checkers, social media is allowing Trump and other candidates to make patently false claims to uninformed voters -- and get away with them.Assistant Professor of Public Relations, Hofstra UniversityFor the first half hour of the opening two-way debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, both candidates appeared tired. But then Clinton sprang into action, forcefully striking back at Sanders for criticizing her acceptance of corporate campaign donations.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonThe growing public health crisis posed by the spread of the Zika virus demands the urgent attention of leaders at all levels of government, including those who seek our nation\u0027s highest office.President, NARAL Pro-Choice AmericaThere\u0027s no doubt that Hillary is the candidate of Wall Street. Even more dangerous, though, is that she is the candidate of the military-industrial complex. The idea that she is bad on the corporate issues but good on national security has it wrong.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityAs president, Bernie Sanders might tweak the Pentagon budget by eliminating a few billion dollars of waste. He might scale back on U.S. interventions. But he would more likely continue in the direction in which he has started moving as candidate: demonstrating that he can wield power just like the big boys.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogRefusing to show interest in a different perspective should not serve as a badge of pride in your own ideas. It actually serves the exact opposite function. It proves that you don\u0027t even understand your own opinion.Director and screenwriter living in LAWe found ourselves this week talking about two very different guys, both born in Canada, who skated to triumph thanks to their fans. Ted Cruz is no team player. He\u0027s out for no one but himself. And he has a history of switching teams until they fulfill his ambitions.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyProducer, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe link between female genital cutting and cases of keloid, dysmenorrhea and urinary incontinence became clear. Five years ago, I decided not to practice excision any more. Soon after, my village decided to ban FGM.Former FGM excisor turned activistOnly when we openly and truthfully speak to the roots of racism and inequality in our country -- white supremacy, white privilege, and the dehumanization and devaluation of black lives and bodies -- will we able to deal with the modern-day realities of that legacy.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe banksters made millions of deliberately fraudulent, not \"reckless\" loans and they most assuredly \"created the foreclosure crisis.\" Hillary went on to throw the victims of these frauds under the bus.Prof; Econ \u0026 Law, UMKC. Financial regulator. White-collar criminologist. Founding member, Bank Whistleblowers United. Author: The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One.I am running to be the 50th Mayor of Baltimore in order to usher our city into an era where the government is accountable to its people and is aggressively innovative in how it identifies and solves its problems. We can build a Baltimore where more and more people want to live and work, and where everyone can thrive.Writer, Educator,Sure, hypocrisy is the coin of the realm in politics, and both sides play that game. But Republicans have taken the false indignation of double standards to a level rarely before seen in our political discourse.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyMore Americans than ever before say they would not let their sons play football. Yet football remains our favorite spectator sport (it\u0027s not even close) and there is nothing to indicate that\u0027s about to change.Author, \u0027The Evangelicals You Don\u0027t Know\u0027Tributes to Marlow Cook in his hometown and state never came his way during his lifetime. It\u0027s long overdue for something of note to be named for this remarkable man, who bucked politics and party to do what he thought was right.JournalistAs a recently suffering Oakland Raiders fan, I greeted the death of Kenny \"The Snake\" Stabler with a cocktail of fond memories. But it\u0027s a cocktail laced with the bitter news that Stabler, like so many of his peers, had suffered for years from the effects of concussions.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
