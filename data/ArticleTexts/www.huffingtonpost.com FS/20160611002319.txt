{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawDonald Trump shamed himself and his party -- and flunked judicial ethics 101 -- with his flagrantly racist suggestion that an Indiana-born federal judge hearing a lawsuit against his sham Trump University had an \"inherent conflict of interest\" because he was \"of Mexican heritage.\" Putting aside Mr. Trump\u0027s noxious pronouncement, there are situations, unrelated to a judge\u0027s race, ethnicity, gender, or religion, when a genuine conflict of interest exists, and a judge\u0027s recusal is essential for preserving the appearance and reality of judicial fairness central to the nation\u0027s justice system. Ruling in such a case on Thursday the Supreme Court, in Williams v. Pennsylvania, correctly overturned the death sentence of a Pennsylvania death row inmate named Terrance Williams because of a glaring, due process-denying conflict.I met Sebenele, a bright 14 year-old boy with a big smile, this week during a visit to Swaziland to see how my fund is helping UNICEF to support and protect children living with HIV. Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. Twenty-four per cent of children here have lost one or both parents to AIDS and many are themselves now living with HIV. I thought about my own children and how in many ways the things Sebenele enjoys are the same things they do. Yet he told me how he is struggling to continue to take his antiretroviral medicine, which is vital to ensure he stays healthy, because he can\u0027t keep the pills down without any food.UNICEF Goodwill AmbassadorStudents of color constitute a majority in our schools but teachers of color constitute only 18 percent of their faculties.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundContrary to those in the media and elsewhere who claimed he was \"far more accepting\" on LGBT issues than other GOP candidates, Donald Trump is proving that he very much will be a force against LGBT equality if elected president.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostPart B drug payment policy. Boring. Obscure. But an ongoing battle over these policies will affect you -- especially what you pay for drugs.Chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of PennsylvaniaWhile Trump\u0027s flaunting of divorces, affairs, and other indiscretions may indicate a certain hubris and lack of regard for public opinion, none of it counts as abuse for everyday American women. The real abuse will come from his policy ideas if he\u0027s elected.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; national gender pay equity consultant, Director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsRacism is still deeply rooted in American society and in white culture. Donald Trump has repeatedly taken the racism that is often covert and made it overt, what is usually implicit and made it explicit. Trump has regularly turned racial \"dog whistles\" into bullhorns.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWhere is your anger at a culture that has more concern for the impact of jailing a rapist than the impact of a rape? Weeks ago, we were told that women needed to be protected. But apparently not from rapists.Writer, speaker, musician, and defender of Oxford comma. Author of \u0027Embracing Grief\u0027If things remain as they are, even senators from the ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) agree that the government will not survive the end of its term.Political reporter, HuffPost BrazilMy parents adopted me when I was a baby. My mother is white; my father is South Asian. They had never understood or even seen the hair texture of a mixed child prior to me entering their lives. It was a huge learning curve that took decades for us.Writer, political enthusiast and animal rights advocateBernie and Hillary are to be tested in the upcoming weeks. Can Bernie take the moral strength of his movement and employ it in the upcoming election? Can Hillary accept his vision and turn it into votes?Senior Fellow, DemosLike millions of others, I really care about the ocean and can\u0027t just sit back and watch it being destroyed. Having had the huge privilege of swimming with magnificent creatures, I am in total awe of our underwater world.Founder, Virgin GroupAt this moment, there is a White House petition to officially recognize Loving Day. That recognition would be deeply meaningful to tens of millions of multiracial Americans and families. It would be a historic celebration of an underrepresented community.Founder and President of the Loving Day ProjectFor thousands of years humans have defended themselves from harm by others. But many have proceeded to regularly harm themselves.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorMichelle, a dance teacher at the Mesa Arts Center, gently patted one of our students\u0027 arms, which was hurt because a boy had pulled it. I looked pointedly in his direction, scrunching my eyebrows sternly at him for deliberately hurting his classmate.Leading Muslim women\u0027s blog in the U.S.Now that Hillary Clinton has won a clear majority of pledged delegates as well as 55 percent of the popular vote and been declared the presumptive nominee, calls for Bernie Sanders to drop out of the race have an undeniable logic. Under normal circumstances, this would -- and should -- be the end of the matter. But this is anything but a normal election, and it would be a mistake at this point for Senator Sanders to withdraw.Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyI want you to know that we hear you. Millions of women have echoed your voice out to the world. Your voice that was stifled and dismissed by the people who needed to hear it most. But WE hear it. And in the past few days, we have echoed it loud and clear.Wife, mother, youth leader, writer, and faithful friend.The contrast in the presidential race could not be sharper: a climate rejectionist vs a candidate who confronts the daunting challenge. Trump, like many Republicans, has moved from denial of man-made climate change to rejection -- to a partial awareness of actuality but unwillingness to acknowledge and act upon overwhelming evidence.Author, \u0027Witness to an Extreme Century: A Memoir\u0027 and \u0027The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide\u0027For me, wearing what I want is non-negotiable. Clothing is my most flamboyant way to show off the real me? -- to announce who I am and where I stand.Vine Star with over a quarter billion views across social, author and LGBTQ youth advocateHillary Clinton just made history but for millions of children she won\u0027t be the first woman president. She\u0027ll just be the president.Director of Client Services, Trilogy InteractiveWhile it\u0027s important to unite in joy throughout this month, it\u0027s equally important to turn our collective attention towards the work left to be done. For trans and gender non-conforming members of the LGBTQI community, every day in this country is a struggle -- a battle not only for equality, but for survival.Blog Editor, Huffington PostBlog Editor, Huffington PostClinton\u0027s biggest problem in this case is her foreign policy record. Most Americans don\u0027t want to intervene more overseas, but Clinton is not most Americans. She is the Democratic neoconservative, a veritable war queen, who backed every major conflict fought by the U.S. over the last quarter century.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIt\u0027s an honor and pleasure to know Mr. Warren Buffett, a great philanthropist as well as the world\u0027s most sought-after oracle of financial wisdom. I hope I don\u0027t sound boastful when I say that I am also proud that when it comes to unconditional love, which is what we devote ourselves to here at GLIDE, Mr. Buffett has demonstrated his investment in unconditional love.Co-Founder, GLIDE FoundationLiving in Hawaii, we are blessed to be surrounded by ocean. Most of the world considers the Hawaiian islands to be paradise, but over the last several decades a spectrum of human activities have taken their toll on the waters surrounding the island.Cuomo is hardly the first public official to take issue with BDS. The governor\u0027s order comes as at least eight other states across the country have enacted anti-BDS legislation over the last year. But Cuomo\u0027s action marks the first time a governor has acted unilaterally against the movement.Communications Officer at the New York Civil Liberties Union\"Art belongs to everybody and nobody. Art belongs to all time and no time. Art belongs to those who create it and those who savor it. Art no more belongs to the People and Party than it once belonged to the aristocracy and the patron. Art is the whisper of history, heard above the noise of time,\" writes Barnes.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnI am twenty, queer, non-gender conforming, trans, black, mentally ill, and despite being college educated and situated in america, i do not expect to live long.Nonbinary aspiring novelist, artist, poet, activist, and scholarWe have the very important responsibility of talking much more about consent and doing so early on in our children\u0027s lives. Talking about acceptable behavior. Talking about rape. Given the age of Brock Turner, and these terrible statistics, clearly, we are not doing enough early enough. Sexual assault happens across demographics, across socioeconomics, even at the pinnacle of educational institutions.Executive Coach, Author of Find Your Sweet SpotTexas and France have a number of things in common. They\u0027re roughly the same size. They were both republics. They have delectable, widely loved cuisines. And, just last week, both were battered by torrential rains and flooding turbocharged by human-made global warming.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsRamadan in the United States is not as dreary as some people may think. The Muslim diaspora here is large, and the ties between them grow stronger during Ramadan.WriterWe now know how Donald Trump feels about and evaluates Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel. We should take a look at the caliber of some of the judges Trump says he would consider appointing to the United States Supreme Court.Trial lawyer, authorGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
