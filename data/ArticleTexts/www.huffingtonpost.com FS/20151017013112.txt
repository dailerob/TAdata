But how plausible is it to believe that her experience and tenacity can enable her to work with Republicans to effect the change we need? No doubt, she\u0027ll be able to keep the government open. And we know there are bad deals that can be cut. But real reform? \"Revolution soon come\" may seem a fantasy. But Sanders\u0027 view that nothing will change unless people rise up, demand change, go to the polls in large numbers and hold their representatives accountable is compelling.

Now that he is a lame duck, with no electoral challenges facing him, he should do the right thing for the country and his successor by pulling the plug on our failed military interventionsAuthor, \u0027The Lebanese Connection: Corruption, Civil War, and The International Drug Trade\u0027The big questions now that Bernie Sanders is contending for the Democratic presidential nomination are what has changed, and why is socialism still the old red herring for so many Americans who don\u0027t wear the GOP party label?Author and political analystAll of those little mis-gendered pronouns and mis-gendered references to those of us who are already struggling to become or stay positive about our lives can be really destructive.

For the first time, I see the greatness of the American dream clearly: deflated by moral contradiction.WondererAlthough the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been around for generations, it still has the capacity to surprise. Even the experts are confused by the current violence that has been roiling Jerusalem for weeks nowResearch Associate Professor of Israel Studies and Executive Director of the Gildenhorn Institute for Israel Studies at the University of MarylandDays ago, US Treasury Secretary Lew asked whether our nation would \"muster the political will to avoid the self-inflicted wounds that come from a political stalemate.\" There\u0027s only one economically sound answer: Congress must raise the debt ceiling, end the sequester, put more people to work, and increase our investment in education and infrastructure.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027The world chess champion Magnus Carlsen came to Berlin this month to defend his other two world titles: in the rapid and blitz play.
