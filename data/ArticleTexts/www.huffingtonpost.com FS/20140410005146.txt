{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureHouse Republicans will line up to pass the Ryan budget. At the same time, they will not even allow a vote on raising the minimum wage or extending unemployment benefits to the long-term unemployed. There are many things wrong with the Republican budget. Its austerity will cost jobs and cripple the economy. Its tax cuts will add to Gilded Age inequality. Its Big Oil agenda continues to ignore catastrophic climate change. Its numbers don\u0027t add up. Its claim to balance the budget in a decade depends on funny money -- assuming faster growth, keeping Obamacare\u0027s tax revenue while repealing its benefits, etc. But put the disagreements aside. Simply accept Republicans at their word: This is who they are.Momentum is building to raise the minimum wage. Senate Democrats will soon introduce legislation raising it nationally to $10.10, from the current $7.25 an hour. All this is fine as far as it goes. But we need to be more ambitious. We should be raising the federal minimum to $15 an hour. Here are seven reasons why.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Your profession has been vilified, scapegoated, mined for profit, and deprofessionalized. On behalf of graduates of public schools, parents of children in public schools, those who value public education and teachers unions, we apologize.Elizabeth Weill-GreenbergBloggerIt turns out that the real estate market in my New York City backyard has been a private equity playground for the last decade, and the result, unsurprisingly, has been a disaster for tenants and the market alike.Laura GottesdienerAuthor, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027We spend many more resources policing and prosecuting crime in the streets than crime in the suites, even though corporate crime is much more costly in terms of death, injury and disease.Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeDehydration can also cause kidney stones, because it allows for stone-causing minerals to concentrate and settle in the kidneys and urinary tract. One of the best measures you can take to avoid kidney stones is to drink plenty of water, resulting in passing lots of clear urine.Leslie Spry, M.D., FACPNational Kidney Foundation spokesperson; Medical director, Dialysis Center of Lincoln, Neb.As the House votes on a budget plan this week, the choice is not between serving the rich or the poor. It\u0027s a choice between investing in broad-based prosperity and continuing a failed experiment of austerity.Rep. John ConyersDean, Congressional Black CaucusWe stopped outside the fraternity house. One girl ran over to the front walk and crouched down about 20 feet from the front door.Katie KoestnerDirector, Take Back The Night FoundationIn medicine, physicians are trained to review evidence and base their practices on the latest scientific discoveries. In business schools, we have a chasm between two types of degrees.Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027The world is OK if we take a few hours to ourselves to relax and revive a little. I start the weekend relaxed, organized and in a splendid mood. Do you need any more reasons?Susie MooreLife Coach, New York CityWait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comIf you ordinarily receive large tax refunds, consider withholding less and instead putting the money to work for you, by either saving or investing a comparable amount throughout the year, or using it to pay down debt. Your goal should be to receive little or no refund.Jason AldermanVice President, Visa Inc.The question is, why? Social Security may be the single most efficient benefit program -- public or private -- in the country. Its annual operating expenses are less than 1 percent of overall costs, a figure which private sector programs should envy.Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourI know that for Shelia\u0027s sake I must go on. I know that she would want me to do something to somehow bring a positive change out of this unspeakable horror.Philip RussoFormer employee, Modoc Country Sheriff\u0027s OfficeThe worst thing about being poor is the fear. It\u0027s the fear of not being able to afford a place to live. It\u0027s the fear of not being able to go to the doctor, buy medicine, or put gas in the car. It\u0027s the fear of never being able to hold our heads up high again.K. Ford K.Author, \u0027The Wife of John the Baptist\u0027 and \u0027The Concubine\u0027s Gift\u0027Elevating women\u0027s pay on par with their male counterparts isn\u0027t only symbolic, it is practical. Is there a more literal marker of how we value women than how we compensate their time and talent? It is a step forward for women\u0027s leadership as well.Barbara LeePresident, Barbara Lee Political Office and Barbara Lee Family Foundation\"Game of Thrones\" always seems ill-considered to me. It wants so badly to say something significant about sex and power that maybe it forgets to take a breath between the two thoughts.Osahon OkundayeProud Wisconsin native and small talk enthusiast. Current Journalism student at NorthwesternI\u0027m going to tell you why you have to quit your job. Why you need to get the ideas moving. Why you need to build a foundation for your life or soon you will have no roof.James AltucherAuthor and EntrepreneurMost days we are going so fast that we need to stop and ask who in our six degrees can use our help? Who needs someone to listen to them?Tim McDonaldDirector of Community, The Huffington PostPerspective and how you choose to view the world around you are, in fact, a choice. I encourage you to always choose to focus on the abundant good that is all around you.Kaitlin Roig-DeBellisFounder, Classes 4 ClassesWomen choose to win lower wages just as much as they choose their gender, ethnicity or race. Making the assertion that the wage gap is somehow women\u0027s fault is not only sexist, it\u0027s racist too.Soraya ChemalyElizabeth PlankLast month a study of siblings found that breastfeeding conferred no health advantages, while a second study declared older paternal age to be associated with psychiatric problems in children. A third study found no link between saturated fats and heart disease. It was a month of unexpected, and sometimes unsettling, science.David H. Newman, M.D.Physician-researcher, leading expert in health care evidenceSkip a class for a drive with the windows down, make more time for roommates -- past and present. Call home but hold tight to your last weekends away. And download Find My iPhone.Meaghan McGoldrickWriter born and based in BrooklynCrap, so that boring document I got in the mail a couple months ago from my employer was important.Emily CohnEditor, HuffPost BusinessDoes Walmart really care more about the fate of about hungry children than does Congress? Um, not really. Walmart has instead acknowledged publicly that federal cuts to food stamps are a threat to its bottom line.Peter Van BurenAuthor of \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"Democracy requires a genuine merit system, not a stagnant personnel bureaucracy wallowing in rigidities and entitlements.Philip K.
