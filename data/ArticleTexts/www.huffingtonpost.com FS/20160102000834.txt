{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe Wall Street Journal ran an interesting piece yesterday morning showing how the effective tax rate -- taxes as a share of income -- spiked up significantly in 2013 for the wealthiest taxpayers due to an increase in the tax rate on capital gains. For readers who also read the recent New York Times piece on the \"income defense industry\" of the wealthy, this WSJ piece may have sown some confusion. Does there really exist an industry of deeply funded anti-tax lobbyists whose sole purpose is to protect the holdings of their clients? Absolutely -- far from \"mistaken,\" that narrative is exactly right. Do they win every fight? Nope, and they lost the one that led the capital gains rate to go up in 2013. But to suggest that this one change alters the fundamental landscape of our tax avoidance problem would be an egregious overstatement.Something Wicked This Way Comes is not only a sinister 1962 fantasy novel by Ray Bradbury, it is also descriptive of the malevolent and growing power of white supremacy in the United States.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminarySince we arbitrarily impose a beginning and an end on our equitable distribution of days, let\u0027s reflect on some of the cycles that dominate our existence: the big ones over which we have no control, the smaller ones we might hope to influence, and those about which we don\u0027t yet know.Physics Professor, Harvard University; Author, \u0027Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe\u0027If you vote for anyone other than Bernie Sanders in 2016, you\u0027re simply not a progressive.

How will we meet the moment?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt is baffling, and that is putting it mildly, that Bernie and his advisers have been so obtuse when it comes to crafting a viable media strategy designed to showcase the notion of political revolution front and center.Author, \u0027Revolution! South America and the Rise of the New Left\u0027Natalie Cole appeared many times as a guest on my PBS television program.

If it was a statement made by a democratic figure, it would be treated as a bad joke in poor taste. But for the authoritarian Erdogan, it\u0027s a rare instance of his honesty, showing how the strongman really feels.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaIf only the people who engage in \"road rage\" would engage in \"corporate rage\" when they are harmed by cover-ups or hazardous products and gouging services, aloof CEOs would start getting serious about safety and fair play.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorApparently, The Force Awakens can only be regarded as a great or appalling film, and nothing else.
