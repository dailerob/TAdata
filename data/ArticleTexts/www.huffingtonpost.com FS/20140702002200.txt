{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyAs we are all surely aware, we now face the most ominous decisions in human history. There are many problems that must be addressed, but two are overwhelming in their significance: environmental destruction and nuclear war. For the first time in history, we face the possibility of destroying the prospects for decent existence -- and not in the distant future. For this reason alone, it is imperative to sweep away the ideological clouds and face honestly and realistically the question of how policy decisions are made, and what we can do to alter them before it is too late.We are living in an era when the very idea of public education is under attack, as are teachers\u0027 unions and the teaching profession. In the past, Democrats supported unions, which they saw as a dependable and significant part of their base. This is no longer the case.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027This is a frivolous lawsuit. Nothing more. It relies almost entirely on the cynical notion that most Americans are frustratingly uneducated about the functioning of the U.S. government, while also dreadfully forgetful when it comes to history that took place just five or ten years ago.Managing Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe series of events that led to the creation of an ISIS state has led to a flurry of pundits and policy makers spewing three common myths about Iraq. Attributing the current crisis to any of these misconceptions not only ignores the history of the region, but has resulted in flawed policy proposals, particularly from Washington.Co-author, Iraq’s Armed Forces: An Analytical HistoryHistory is divided on whether adding sex discrimination to the list of no-nos in the 1964 Civil Rights Act was meant to be a joke or a death knell for the bill. Either way, with women still making 77 cents on the dollar compared to men and the courts now firmly on the side of corporations, the joke is on women now.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsTwo things are absolutely clear about this Supreme Court term. One, it\u0027s once again been a very good term for the Chamber of Commerce. And, two, it\u0027s been an even better one for the business community writ large.Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterWhile its not likely to stifle the flood of money being spent on political ads, the FCC\u0027s online file will help shed light on the groups that are spending so much -- giving voters more clarity on who\u0027s trying to influence their choices at the ballot box.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressOur constant rhetoric -- particularly from Washington -- asserts that we have made progress since the colonialism of King Leopold in the Congo. International criminal justice and human rights are pursued with relish, are they not? Not according to the example of Richard Bruce Cheney.Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)A teacher believes there are no bad students, just challenging ones. A teacher will question and teach her students how to question. A teacher\u0027s day does not end when the buses pull out.Mother, teacher, bloggerSo while a business corporation can\u0027t go to church, fast on Yom Kippur, or travel to Mecca for Ramadan, it can still go to court and, on the basis of religious freedom, demand to be exempted from the law that applies to everyone else. Today, women are the victim. Tomorrow, it could be LGBT people.Professor of Law, UCLAExplosions substituting for character development. General cinematic bloatedness. You know these things. But in case your instincts need a little sharpening, I will save you your money -- and a precious three hours of your precious life.Poet, author, and activistThe Facebook experiment should thus be a wake-up call that there are some very challenging issues ahead for privacy that we must think more deeply about. Facebook is in the spotlight, but move the light over just a little, and you\u0027ll see many others.John Marshall Harlan Research Professor, George Washington University Law SchoolScience fiction is becoming science reality. Many of the technologies that we saw in Star Trek are beginning to materialize, and ours may actually be better than Starfleet\u0027s. Best of all, we won\u0027t have to wait 300 years.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurBy far, the biggest challenge I faced during my sugar challenge was the simple task of determining whether something had added sugar or not. I read labels, asked wait staff, and did online research and still was not always confident that I was eating something sugar-free.Lead analyst at the Center for Science and Democracy at UCSReliable birth control that permits women to manage how many children to have, and when to have them, has been nothing short of revolutionary -- not just for women and mothers, but for our country as a whole.Executive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgAs youth, we learn from our elders; and if our elders are bigoted, anti­-women, anti-­LGBTQ, anti­-immigrant, anti-anything equality ­based, brutes who harass others with their religiosity, they\u0027ll only send messages to the youth that bigotry is tolerable.17-year-oldWhat should Democrats take away from Warren\u0027s visit to Kentucky? And what does it tell Hillary Clinton? It demonstrates Bill\u0027s old-fashioned triangulation -- the means by which the Democratic Party moved itself toward the corporate right -- has passed its sell-by date, even in Bill\u0027s native South.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourI know for myself that watching one character grieve over the other, I floated between the fictional story and the real. I remembered losing Stephen; I imagined losing my second husband.Author, \u0027My Foreign Cities\u0027Like our nation, the Internet was founded on the principles of openness and competition. It has become the ultimate marketplace of ideas, where everyone has a voice and the best products or services succeed based on their own merit. Open Internet principles are the Bill of Rights for the online world.Chairman, Senate Judiciary CommitteeThey may not have souls, but they\u0027re not inanimate objects, either. Ideas are alive in them, and they can contain characters more real than some people I know. Writers spend years struggling to create them, to get them published, noticed, bought and read; how can they not embody some of an author\u0027s spirit?USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorI\u0027m totally dispirited. One, by the killing of the three teenagers and, two, by the Israeli government\u0027s (and the Jewish organizations here) ugly reaction to it. Ugly and political, designed to justify the war against Hamas that Netanyahu lusts for.BloggerAmerican teachers today work harder under much more challenging conditions than teachers elsewhere in the industrialized world. They also receive less useful feedback, less helpful professional development, and have less time to collaborate to improve their work.Charles E. Ducommun Professor of Education at Stanford UniversityMost people I have worked with in my career are very rational, responsible people. And yet, I have found the discussion, and the training, more necessary than I would have expected because of unintentional harassment rather than deliberate unpleasant behavior.President and CEO, FirstRainFolks in the Hudson Valley have lived the New York City life, gotten their hard-partying, 70-hour-a-week-working, and dank-apartment-living in and put it behind them. Fun while it lasted, but eventually you want to settle down, mow a lawn and not smell pee and garbage all the time, you know?Brooklyn-based culture, entertainment and comedy wordsmith.In college, I had my glasses on all the time. I wore glasses to formals, in a cappella performances, on the beach. (I took them off for yoga class, which means I learned virtually blind. It was difficult.) And almost without fail, when I was dressed up but also had glasses on, someone would ask me, \"don\u0027t you have contacts?\"Associate Editor, HuffPost WomenThe government-imposed barriers to entry in the pharmaceutical industry don\u0027t just raise prices by 20 or 30 percent, as may be the case with taxi fares; they raise prices by a factor or 10, 20, or even 100 (that would be 10,000 percent).Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We as advocates for female writers and editors should make an effort to celebrate the publications that employ large numbers of women. Community newspapers and journals do just that. Yet those publications tend to pay less than national ones pay.Writer. Visual Storyteller. Editor of QuailBellMagazine.com.We\u0027re rearing children in a world that is obsessed with how technology can help us avoid error and save time, we must be careful not to completely diminish the great joy that is found in the small and happy accidents of life.postgradgrays.comOn this final day of the term, the Supreme Court will be handing down a decision with potentially broad implications not only for the rights of women and workers, but also for corporate personhood and religious liberty.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterThree hundred years ago, during the Age of Enlightenment, the coffee house became the center of innovation. Back then, most people went from drinking beer to consuming coffee (i.e. from being tipsy to being wired) and ideas started exploding.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEBefore finding fame and garnering several Emmy nods and two Golden Globe wins for his role in TV\u0027s House, he was a member of Cambridge University\u0027s Footlights Revue and a familiar face -- as a comedian -- on British TV.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027TIL 2018...",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
