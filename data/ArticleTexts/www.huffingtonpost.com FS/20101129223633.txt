Haass, 11.29.2010President, Council on Foreign RelationsThe latest leak of some 250,000 documents by WikiLeaks does not appear to constitute a national security crisis, although it will cause more than a little near-term awkwardness for the United States and its partners.Read Post | CommentsEli Broad, 11.29.2010Founder, The Broad FoundationsAs New Yorkers consider whether Cathie Black is qualified to run the New York City Department of Education, it is worth looking at why leaders without education backgrounds have succeeded in the past.Read Post | CommentsSimon Jenkins, 11.29.2010Writer for the Guardian and the London Sunday TimesThe media organizations in receipt of the cables went to extraordinary lengths over the past two months to check and \"redact\" the material.
