{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"So much of the news and information directed at women these days seems determined to make us feel that our lives are somehow lacking. We are constantly made to feel that we should be prettier, thinner, sexier, more successful, better moms, better wives, better lovers, etc. Though often wrapped in a you-go-girl! message, the subtext is clear: we should feel bad because we have tummies, not abs; bad because we don\u0027t always feel like sex kittens, or bad because we do; bad because we don\u0027t have a color-coded filing system for our recipes. Not at HuffPost Women, which launches today. It is designed to be a place where women can come to be informed, inspired, entertained, and celebrated. Check it out here. I also want to announce a cool milestone: This weekend, HuffPost received our 100,000,000th comment! That\u0027s a staggering number, and we are really grateful to you, our community, for such amazing engagement and participation.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 7/31/11Award-winning actress, author and activistIt seems like a good time to take stock of how far women have come in this world.
