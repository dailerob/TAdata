{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonJapan\u0027s spirit is being tested by the same recession and financial crisis afflicting all industrialized nations. But paradoxically, there are answers to be found to Japan\u0027s very modern crises in its most ancient traditions. There are shrines and temples and gardens everywhere. It is common to see monks meditating and easy to join them in meditation. And the latest twist is Buddhist temples using Zen meditation, cold-water ablutions and other traditional ceremonial practices to help young people looking for jobs! By taking its traditions and adapting them to solve new problems, by going both forward and backward, both outward and inward -- juxtapositions that in Japan don\u0027t have to be contradictions -- the people of Japan are poised find a new and vibrant balance for the 21st century.CommentsMika BrzezinskiCo-host of MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\"This is the book I have been afraid to write . . . terrified actually.

IBM scientists have turned the problem on itself, tackling one of the world\u0027s largest big data challenges in the smallest way -- one atom at a time. In fact, the folks at Guinness World Records have certified the movie as the \"World\u0027s Smallest Stop-Motion Film.\"CommentsEva LongoriaActress, Founder of the Eva Longoria FoundationAre maids a realistic reflection of Latinas in America today??

This crisis is evident in many ways, including the prevalence of once-aspiring professional black male athletes who end up with no degree, few job prospects, and used-up eligibility.CommentsSuze OrmanHost, \"The Suze Orman Show\"There are no money problems.

While I was not the best student, their efforts left a lasting impact.CommentsMark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVAt the Mavericks we have been diving into any and all advances in medical science that can give us a competitive edge.

One that is obvious is the use of stem cells.Comments (16)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027The love fest between Barack Obama and his top fundraiser Penny Pritzker that has led to her being nominated as Commerce secretary would not be so unseemly if they both just confessed that they did it for the money.Comments (317)????Kenji Shibuya: Professor of Global Health Policy, University of TokyoFor the last 20 years, Japan has been ranked number one in the world with respect to both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. But Japan should not be complacent simply because of its high life expectancy.Comments (38)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comCould the United States actually be the last empire? Is it possible that there will be no successor because something has profoundly changed in the realm of empire building?Comments (68)Mark WilliamsProfessor of Clinical Psychology and Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow, University of OxfordWhile wisdom is not the enemy of emotional commitment nor of cool rationality, neither strong emotion nor logic alone are the best route to the wise mind. While only few can be clever, anyone -- no matter what their job, age or status -- can be wise.Comments????Shigeki Matsuura: Editor in Chief, The Huffington Post JapanHuffPost Japan hopes to be the place where we have an honest conversation about the future of Japan, and our editors will work to bring your voices and ideas onto our pages to achieve this.Comments (101)Christine Gross-LohAuthor, Parenting Without Borders: Surprising Lessons Parents Around the World Can Teach UsThough parents around the world have the same goals, American parents like me (despite our very best intentions) have gotten it all backwards.Comments (26)Brenna WeingusDance competition show enthusiast\"Dancing with the Stars\" is down to just six couples and the frontrunners of the season are becoming more and more defined. With powerful numbers from Zendaya, Aly, and Kellie, this season seems to belong to the girls.Comments (127)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersIf this deadly dynamic isn\u0027t solved -- if the biggest banks aren\u0027t broken up, if the Department of Justice doesn\u0027t start prosecuting crime in the financial sector -- our country will in the not too distant future see a financial crisis far worse than in 2008.Comments (68)Mindy CohnActress, The Facts of LifeWhile nothing I have done has reached the popularity of The Facts of Life, I have continued to work with some of the most talented people ...

That can\u0027t happen, so I\u0027m channeling those dreams into a new purpose in life. You showed me how to love myself and fight for what\u0027s right, so I\u0027m devoting myself to doing the same for others.Comments (51)Ken Dychtwald Ph.D.Gerontologist, psychologist, author, entrepreneur and public speakerI know that everyone needs and wants a break, but do you really want to be disengaged from productive activities for the rest of your life? Can you afford not to work at all for so many decades?

But the outbursts can only be helpful if they are taken seriously and not dismissed or censored by the outrage police.Comments (42)Seema JilaniPhysician reporting from AfghanistanI don\u0027t need you to \"tolerate\" me. I don\u0027t want you to merely put up with my presence. All I ask, all I have ever asked, is to be treated as a human being, that bigoted jingoism is not injected into every minute facet my life, that there remains at least the illusion of decency.Comments (112)Anthony PapaManager, Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceIn 1973, two years after President Nixon declared a \"war on drugs,\" New York Governor Rockefeller passed the toughest drug laws in the nation, demanding mandatory sentences for drug law violations, while removing the judge\u0027s power to consider each case individually.CommentsDavid BromwichProfessor of Literature at YaleIs America at War with Islam?
