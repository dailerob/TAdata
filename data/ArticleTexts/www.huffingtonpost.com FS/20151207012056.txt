{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the nation was horrified by yet another mass shooting -- this one in San Bernardino, as a heavily armed husband and wife killed 14 and injured 21 at a social services center. Within days, the F.B.I. announced that it was treating the carnage as a terrorist attack. While we may not be able to guarantee that such appalling events never happen, we can control our reaction to them. As investigators continue to look into the couple\u0027s motives, it\u0027s important that we not surrender our core values of tolerance and openness. The actions of a few have nothing to do with the nearly 3 million Muslims living peacefully in the U.S. Already, a mosque in Virginia has received death threats, and an Islamic center in Florida was vandalized. To give in to those impulses is to give the enemies of tolerance what they want. The actions of extremists and terrorists can\u0027t defeat us, but we can defeat ourselves.\"Thoughts and prayers\" are not solutions for the 30,000 people who will be killed by a gun this year -- we need sensible gun safety legislation NOW.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersDr. King warned us that America may go to hell if we didn\u0027t deal with the violence of poverty in his last Sunday sermon. I am sure he would say we were going to go to hell as well today if we don\u0027t stop the violence of guns that is ravaging our families and communities and terrifying our children. We must act to save our country\u0027s soul.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAnd that is why we say: Global warming is the human-rights challenge of our time. If we do not address it, collectively, it can only mean we have decided that the rights of some members of the human family are more important than others.Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownFounder and Executive Director of the Tutu Institute for Prayer and PilgrimageJustice -- of sorts -- was finally delivered as Donald Blankenship, the former Chairman and CEO of Massey Energy, was convicted of conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards at the Upper Branch Mine in West Virginia, where 29 workers died in April 2010. Here\u0027s a blog I wrote about it a few months after the disaster.Take a look at some of their plans, including the riders congressional Republicans are contemplating for inclusion in the omnibus spending bill that must be passed by December 11. The whole mess is a Bad Santa\u0027s list of loopholes benefiting High Finance, tax cuts for the rich, and budget cuts for everyone else, even as they drive the nation deeper into debt and disrepair.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.One year ago, a grand jury failed to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo for the killing of my father, Eric Garner. As I contemplate this past year -- a year full of upheaval and struggles for justice -- I\u0027m struck by what has changed: nothing.Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerPolitical Director at the Garner Way FoundationWhat words are left? If we as a nation are willing to allow mass causality gun crimes to go unanswered with legislation that could make a meaningful difference in the lives of our people, what words are left to share with those killed at the social services center in San Bernardino, CA today?Director of the Center for Peace and Spirituality and University Chaplain at Pacific UniversityThere are family obligations at the holidays, but not every obligation need be met, especially if they cause sadness, resentment, or regret. Whether or not you have someone in your life struggling with mental illness, you\u0027re only as helpful as you are healthy yourself.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAt a time when major presidential candidates demonize difference, and when attackers respond to groups they\u0027ve been inspired to hate with terrorism, let\u0027s recognize the constructive value of ongoing debate and that politicized campuses remain places of confrontation and of real learning.President, Wesleyan UniversityInstead of asking, or even begging, corporations and countries to please reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in Paris, we would like to follow The Pope\u0027s lead and suggest that there is a simpler, more effective and more just way to deal with the existential threat facing life on this planet.Composer, singer, actor and activistCommunication Strategist, Author of \"Words That Shook The World\"Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandSinger and songwriterNone of the above candidates are calling for a database of extreme right wing evangelicals. White supremacists who murder black church goers and white young men who shoot school children don\u0027t qualify either.Actress and authorYou deserve a chance to experience the beautiful world that I grew up in. We all need clean air, clean water and natural resources to lead healthy lives.Senate Minority Leader (D-Nev.)While the lifespan of affluent whites continues to lengthen, the lifespan of poor whites has been shrinking. As a result, in just the last four years, the gap between poor white men and wealthier ones has widened by up to four years.New York Times bestselling authorThis commitment will require shifting the global energy system to clean energy and innovation across all sectors of the economy. It will unleash new technological solutions, mobilise large-scale investment, and shape consumer behavior, all of which will create new jobs and unprecedented economic opportunities.Founder, Virgin GroupDirector of the board\u0027s sustainable development committee, Kering; Co-Founder and Co-Chair, The B TeamPrayer alone cannot fix these troubled and dangerous times. Nor can prayer be used by politicians -- or any of us -- to excuse inaction or to demonstrate one\u0027s compassion, while continuing to support gun policies that will only allow more shootings.President, Auburn Theological SeminaryAny U.S. citizen who believes there is not a serious problem in the U.S. Armed Forces with fundamentalist, evangelical Christianity, must be, as I often remark to my students when I describe some particularly egregious and otherwise inexplicable failing, \"smoking some good stuff.\"Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)McDonald\u0027s is gross and greasy. But my humiliation, and that of my friends and my family, wasn\u0027t because I made burgers. It was because I was supposed to be \"better\" than that. I realized this attitude was way more gross than shoveling fries. Because I am not better than a McDonald\u0027s worker.Freelance writer and web designerFor too long the Burmese people could only look to the future and hope for change. Today they have a chance to enjoy the opportunities that the rest of us take for granted. Hopefully now, after decades of conflict, the future finally has arrived for Burma.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteGun ownership isn\u0027t some inalienable right granted by God. Remember, the Constitution was written by men coming out of a long and bloody war near the end of the 18th century. It was written for their time. It also included the \"right\" to own a human being. Things change.Comedian; author of \"DC Trip\" (Adaptive Books)On November 24, 2015 the General Assembly of the United Nations passed six anti-Israeli resolutions -- in one day. Some of them relate to issues that should be addressed: Occupation, settlement building, Palestinian rights, peace. But the text of each and every one is outrageous.Author, \u0027My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel\u0027It is cause for concern that France, with its proud identity as a bastion of civil liberties, is now joining a dubious list of governments that use security as a justification to cut down on individual rights.Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationNot enough people realize that three quarters of all psychiatric illness has its onset before the age of 24, and half before 14. And because kids are still developing, the earlier treatment is started, the better the prognosis.NFL wide receiver; Co-founder, PROJECT 375Kylie Jenner\u0027s photo and the conversation around it made me uncomfortable as a disabled person, but not just because she was using a wheelchair as a prop. I was uncomfortable when I read Tweets that suggested that the wheelchair was used as a prop to symbolize the \"limitations\" Kylie Jenner experienced through being famous.Disability rights activist, inclusive fashionista, grad student, and bloggerIn 1939, it was the Jews whose lives were threatened. Today, it is the Syrians. I can think of no cause more important, and more satisfying, than saving the lives of those threatened by racial, religious, sexual or political persecution.President emeritus, Open Society InstituteLooking back, I realize that somewhere along the way, that passionate kiss we used to greet each other with at the end of a long day had morphed into a peck on the cheek that had -- in recent years -- morphed into barely a glance up from the computer screen.Senior Editor, The Huffington PostThe IAEA\u0027s \"Final Report\" is more a political face-saving exercise than technical expose. Fortunately, reason prevailed, and the PMD case against Iran has run its course, not with the bang anticipated by its supporters, but rather a whisper.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Right now it feels like we\u0027re all live-blogging this dystopian society that\u0027s unraveling before our very eyes and smartphones.Kiva Fellow\"Our No. 1 goal for the next year is to put together a complete alternative to the left\u0027s agenda,\" said Paul Ryan as he unveiled his agenda. Despite the speech\u0027s sweeping oratory and careful stagecraft, Ryan clings to seven dumb ideas that are also cropping up among Republican presidential candidates.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Hillary\u0027s gender plays an extremely important role in this election, and it cannot and should not be ignored.Radio Personality at \"Zach Sang \u0026 The Gang,\" LA-based writer, producer and half of Daft Punk for all you know.Today, Republican front-runner Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with 100 leading Black pastors, some who said they may be endorsing him and others who said they just want to hear him out.President, National Action NetworkGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
