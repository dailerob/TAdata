{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From nytimes.comThere is much to be grateful for this Thanksgiving: Democrats once again control Congress, Rummy is out, and most gratifying, there are no more hungry people in America. At least not officially. That\u0027s right, by government decree, the 35 million Americans who aren\u0027t always sure where their next meal is coming from will now be referred to as people experiencing \"very low food security.\" How Orwellian. Of course, this White House whitewash won\u0027t change the reality of hunger in America. That will take a national commitment from our leaders -- and from all of us. Something to think about as we sit down to our Thanksgiving feasts. For more takes inspired by the holiday, be sure to check out our Thanksgiving Day blog parade below.READ POST | comments11.23.2006 Bob CescaThanks, Senator Ted Stevens, for making gibberish awesome again: \"It\u0027s a series of TUBES!\" Thanks, Thom Hartmann \u0026 Keith Olbermann, for reinventing how issues are framed and debated in this country.READ POST | comments11.23.2006 Jane SmileyIt is a holiday tradition in our house for someone (and it can be anyone) to be brought to tears about the food. I guess that\u0027s what you would call \"over-investment\".READ POST | comments11.23.2006 Alec BaldwinThese are men and women who have answered a call and sacrificed for their country, even in the worst of political times.READ POST | comments11.23.2006 John RidleyI am thankful that Republican, Democrat, Red and Blue are fading obelisks on the cultural landscape. Irrelevant, and replaced by the only ideology that is of any substance: pragmatism. Raging independence.READ POST | comments11.23.2006 Merrill MarkoeThis is Thanksgiving, a special time with the family! So why do they insist on bringing up all this stuff in front of these other people? You can\u0027t just haul off and let them have it, can you? Not on this day of gratitude and togetherness! What exactly are you supposed to do?READ POST | comments11.23.2006 Chris DurangHolidays were always hell for me as a child. Christmas and New Years Eve were about the angry non-alcoholics trying to stop the in-denial alcoholics from getting drunk.

BUSH: I\u0027m thankful for the belated recognition, by some at least, that a little pre-war advice I was trying to pass along turned out to be pretty damned spot-on prescient after all is said and done.READ POST11.23.2006 E. A. HanksThanksgiving is a holiday for the beauty of generosity. It is the very best of that idea, and it is the very best of America.READ POST11.23.2006 John SeeryThe religious sanctimony blessing the whole affair during my childhood was just that--and a cover for the violence, alcoholism, and patriarchy that lurked just beneath and behind the red barn paint.READ POST | comments11.23.2006 Larry BeinhartWe are headed for a period of grand public drama and fabulous political entertainment. Ploys and counter-ploys, confrontations and threats, and courtroom moments that will top the Nixon and Clinton impeachments combined.READ POST11.22.2006 Marty KaplanWhat do President Bush and the national turkey have in common?
