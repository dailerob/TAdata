{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, El Huffington PostThe Greeks have deactivated the switch that threatened to blow Europe sky high. Antonis Samaras\u0027s New Democracy party victory in Greece does not in and of itself solve Athens\u0027 problems, nor those plaguing the rest of Europe\u0027s capitals.

What was going on in there? Did I know anything about how they worked? I started to look at all of them as mysteries to be solved, which meant that I often dated withholding men.Read Post | Comments (327)Carol Hartsell, 06/18/12Senior Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostIn writing this post I bear some responsibility for keeping the \"are women funny\" conversation alive for another news cycle.
