{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic RelationsThe Obama people\u0027s muscular policies are cast in the certainties and self-righteousness that have become the theme music to all we do. The volume grows in proportion to the decline in our ability to accomplish anything of value in the world. Whistling past the graveyard of our failures, we obsessively return to the tunes we sang with lusty, and more innocent, self-confidence as a younger nation.

Absolutely not.Read Post | CommentsAlon Ben-Meir, 09.20.2010Senior Fellow at NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe Arab states should heed Obama\u0027s call to meaningfully contribute to the peace process by pressing Hamas to renounce violence and accept the principles of the Arab Peace Initiative, and Israel must accept that Hamas is a reality.Read Post | CommentsKofi Annan, 09.20.2010Former UN Secretary GeneralHosting the world leaders that signed the Millennium Declaration in New York is certainly among the highlights of my UN career.

Jackson, 09.20.2010Administrator of The EPAFor every dollar we\u0027ve spent, we\u0027ve received more than $40 of benefits, making the Clean Air Act one of the most cost-effective things the American people have done for themselves in the last half century.Read Post | CommentsVinod Thomas, 09.20.2010Vice-President of the Independent Evaluation Group, World BankAlthough it may not be possible to prevent global crises, countries can take actions to prepare for them.
