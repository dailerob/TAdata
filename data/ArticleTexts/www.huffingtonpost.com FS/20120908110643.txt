{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO and co-CIO, PIMCONotwithstanding citizens dropping out of the labor force, 5 million Americans were classified in August as \"long-term unemployed.\" Meanwhile, teenage joblessness rose to over 24% -- an alarming level given the risk that out of work youth face in going from being unemployed to being unemployable.

The bottom line is a simple one. It should concern us all as citizens and parents.

But when 125 -- one hundred and twenty five -- students coordinate to commit academia\u0027s cardinal sin, well, that speaks to a vastly larger issue, an issue of a flawed culture.Read Post | Comments (23)Cristen Conger, 09/07/12Co-host, Stuff Mom Never Told You podcast and staff writer, HowStuffWorks.com.When the Internet told me that Amy Poehler and Will Arnett are splitting after nine years of marriage, I audibly gasped.Read Post | CommentsJanet Harris, 09/07/12News analyst and president, Upstream AnalysisTwo weeks of Republican and Democratic conventioneering concluded last night with President Obama\u0027s speech accepting the nomination of his party.
