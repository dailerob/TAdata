{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, National Iranian American CouncilIt took seven years of talks to convince Gaddafi\u0027s Libya to dismantle its nuclear program. There were numerous setbacks, even breakdowns, along the way before a final agreement was reached. That is not the situation between the West and Iran for a very simple reason -- the U.S. and the EU are going to significantly escalate the pressure on Iran in the coming weeks. The EU\u0027s oil embargo and U.S. sanctions on Iran\u0027s oil sales will formally come into effect at the end of the month. And as unprecedented as these measures are, the U.S. will move shortly thereafter to impose even more sanctions to strangle Iran\u0027s oil exports. The pattern of the past 10 years clearly shows that when one side escalates, the other side counter-escalates. Neither side has had a particularly elaborate or sophisticated strategy. It\u0027s been nothing more than a kindergarten-level tit-for-tat game. This is the takeaway from the Moscow talks.Read Post | Comments (92)Robert Reich, 06/20/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Wall Street can\u0027t have it both ways -- too big to fail, and also able to make wild bets anywhere around the world.
