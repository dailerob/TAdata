{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe United States Freedom Act does not trouble Intelligence agency leaders. They have widely assumed, as admitted in private statements, that the compromise provisions merely create a few procedural inconveniences that could be circumvented or neutralized by exploiting loopholes -- no more than speed bumps. None of the Agency\u0027s core activities would be significantly affected. So there is no reason for anyone in the intelligence agencies to sweat the small stuff: a shift in the number of days the NSA can retain the sweepings of Metadata collection; or whether the data should be held at their storage lock-up or the one across the street protected by a bicycle lock and owned by a very accommodating neighbor? And who\u0027s checking, anyway -- the FBI? the FCC?Some in Europe, especially in Germany, seem nonchalant about a Greek exit from the eurozone. The market has, they claim, already \"priced in\" such a rupture. I believe that such views significantly underestimate both the current and future risks involved.Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsMy truth is not yours, nor my female identity yours, either. But I have my truth and my female identity, and all I ask is that you respect mine as I respect yours. I have travelled through the world as a woman and been shaped by it, just not for as long as you.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandHistory shows the very opposite of progress when it comes to these democratic sovereignty-shredding and job-exporting corporate-driven trade treaties -- unless progress is referring to fulfilling the deepest wishes of runaway global corporations.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIt\u0027s not an exaggeration to say that we depend upon the ocean for our very existence. Covering almost three-quarters of the planet, the mighty ocean is a natural resource like no other. Our fate is inextricably tied to the ocean\u0027s fate and the ocean is in trouble. Each of us needs to take action to keep the ocean healthy.U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the EnvironmentIn every election cycle since 2008, more money has gone into lobbying at the federal level than into political campaigns. And an increasing portion of that lobbying money has gone into the pockets of former members of Congress.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The American Civil Rights Movement unfolded over many decades and upon multiple planes. Most commonly, however, the planes of struggle considered are public schools, lunch counters, and buses. Yet, one of the most significant planes upon which this critical history unfolded were places of recreation: beaches and swimming pools.Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasAs the Supreme Court\u0027s ruling on same-sex marriage bans looms, the right wing has begun their assault on reason and intellect with the standard dire warnings, threats, and fear mongering in the form of corporate boycotts and revolt. As usual, their claims include flagrant misinterpretations of their favorite documents, the Constitution and the Bible.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comJim Bob claims that, \"This wasn\u0027t rape or anything like that. This was touching over the clothes.\" This perception that touching is somehow less traumatic than penetration is not only false, it is incredibly damaging to victims, and helps perpetuate a culture of victim-blaming.Speaker, advocate, and attorney dedicated to empowering women and ending sexual and domestic violence. Find her at http://pamelajacobs.com.The President is asking for \"fast track\" authority to let the White House be the sole negotiator on the Trans Pacific Partnership. The so-called partnership is an insult to all U.S. workers, with many provisions that will hurt women the most.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThere\u0027s only one candidate who so far has been either ignored or ridiculed by the majority of the American media during his entire campaign. He is a candidate with firm values and authentic determination. That candidate\u0027s name is Bernie Sanders -- and he could, and should, be the 45th President of the United States of America.Amateur writer, amateur musician, proud Dominican, proud progressive. Columbia University, Class of 2019.For the grieving mother or father of an innocent child killed at the hands of an officer \"by mistake\" or for any other unjustified reason, even hinting that stop-and-frisk reform has led to an increase in crime is to put the nail in the coffin of that child.President, National Action NetworkRepublicans like McConnell love to talk about bureaucrats gumming up the works. But what they really want is to get government out of the business of protecting consumers and workers from unscrupulous corporations, too many of whom will take every chance they get to maximize profits without concern for the dangers those risks pose to the rest of us.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027We all come from different backgrounds, and each of our children is unique. I have learned I am in no position to judge the decisions other parents makes for themselves and their children.SF-Based MomForty-two Republicans, none of whom even bothered to speak in opposition, voted to continue discrimination, and my amendment was defeated. Some of those Republicans had previously voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, so they retreated from their earlier stand against workplace discrimination against LGBT Americans.U.S. Senator from New HampshireForeign vessels have been plundering the waters of West Africa for decades to stock the fish markets of Europe and Asia. Industrial fishing is depriving West African people of a vital source of protein and pushing thousands of locals into poverty and despair.Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalThe truth is that the GOP knows it can\u0027t push its extreme, out-of-touch agenda on a country where every voice is heard. They know they have to do everything they can to silence the voices of everyday Americans because it\u0027s the only way they\u0027ll keep winning elections.President of EMILY\u0027s List and American WomenIn a prominent editorial this past Sunday, the New York Times once again advocated the adoption of a carbon tax. While the theory of a carbon tax makes perfect sense, its lack of practicality makes it the unicorn of energy politics.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteAmericans know the ugly truth about money in politics. Though the wealthy conceal payoffs through dark money deposits into political pockets, it\u0027s no secret to the American public that the rich are buying the government.International President, United SteelworkersWe assume a lot about people, and especially about their bodies. Maybe it somehow seems more reasonable to make assumptions about the things we can see. These women are my friends, my village, and they are willing to share their stories with you so that you may honor them.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.Because much of the cooperation between Iran and North Korea is shrouded in mystery, their relationship is ripe for exploitation, particularly by those who are eager to find a hammer to destroy the impending nuclear agreement with Iran. But if this is the only implement that critics can find to inflict damage, they\u0027re scraping the bottom of their toolbox of destruction.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogAre elite college professors really overpaid? We\u0027ve reached a point in this country where astronomical paydays are deemed acceptable as long as they occur in the private sector -- and merely decent earnings in the public sector are suspect.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027This uncensored plunge into the world of prostitution in Marrakech is realistic for some and shocking for others. The film, several scenes of which have already been leaked online, will undoubtedly leave its mark on the history of Moroccan cinema.Editorial Director, HuffPost MoroccoWelcome to NYC, concrete jungle where dreams are made of. Yes, there\u0027s nothing -- and no one -- you can\u0027t do. It\u0027s time to put on your most badass Zara outfit, paint your face with Sephora contouring pencils -- and go into battle.Australian writer living in New York City. Co-founder and Creative Director (Did Someone Say Science?). Producer (TYT Network).The Hunger Games was supposed to be fiction, but maybe it was prophetic. Now comes The Briefcase, CBS\u0027s new reality show that pits desperate middle-class families against each other for financial survival.Democratic strategist and writerLike any relationship, friendship changes over time. Things like marriage, job relocations, parenthood, and illness all can step in and change the nature of a friendship. Even the most resilient friendship can change over time. But sometimes, if we\u0027re really lucky, we have that one friend with whom the bond is just as strong now as ever. Our BFFs. Besties. Friends for life.Author, Writer, LawyerBrand name medications have always been extremely expensive in the U.S. Lately, these prices have gotten far worse because the price of most brand-name medications have been climbing much faster than the rate of inflation or even most other health care costs in this country.Board Certified in Internal MedicineI dream about a future for my child where there really is equal opportunity. Right now, a small percentage of the population does overwhelmingly better than the rest. Like every parent, I hope my child can have the best chances.Actress, wifeAmerica\u0027s current leadership has failed to grasp the significance of a radical global change underway inside the Eurasian land mass.Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-MadisonMaking an effort to decrease the amount of food you waste has several benefits, from money savings to environmental support and even philanthropy. Curious where to start? A little planning and self-awareness goes a long way.Dietitian, Chef, Real Food Advocate, MomWhat started in 2009 as a group of twenty-five has expanded to over 6,000 Muslim clergy who are now training one another to preach and teach about the importance of the dignity and empowerment of women and girls within Islam.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
