{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"In his otherwise excellent speech on Wednesday, the president showed that, when it comes to the plight of the middle class, he still doesn\u0027t get it. \"Not everything we\u0027ve done over the last two years has worked as quickly as we had hoped,\" he said, \"and I am keenly aware that not all our policies have been popular.\" But the problem isn\u0027t that his economic policies have been slow to succeed or unpopular -- it\u0027s that they\u0027ve been inadequate given the magnitude of the crisis. And, in his sit-down with George Stephanopoulos, he insisted that his administration has made \"the right decisions to move this country forward after a very devastating recession.\" Can he really believe that, with unemployment at 9.6 percent, millions of homes foreclosed, and the middle class under assault? In any case, this appears to be the administration\u0027s story, and they are sticking to it -- come hell or a double-dip recession.Read Post | CommentsSimon Johnson, 09.09.2010MIT Professor and co-author of 13 BankersWhat could Obama possibly do that would mobilize his political base and put his opponents on the defensive?

To say the Quran promotes terrorism because of violent passages is as wrong as saying the Jewish and Christian faiths are evil because the way God is portrayed sometimes gets a little nasty.Read Post | CommentsLincoln Mitchell, 09.09.2010Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityObama\u0027s speech hit most of the right points, but still seemed a bit tone deaf.

America was in a state of imperial overstretch, riven by a foolish war and roiled by divisive politics. And Hart has had a unique vantage point throughout.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 09.09.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe new proposal would pit middle-class seniors against the elderly poor, forcing them to compete for a stripped-down pool of dollars.
