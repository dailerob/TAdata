{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week was a time of penance. President Obama apologized for having given the impression that insurance policies would not be cancelled due to Obamacare. And 60 Minutes correspondent Lara Logan apologized for a Benghazi report that included an apparently false account by a security contractor. It\u0027s a good start; maybe these apologies will open the floodgates. Like maybe Sen. Lindsay Graham can apologize for using the faulty CBS report as an excuse for placing holds on all administration nominees. Or how about an apology from the GOP for the 47 million people affected by painful food stamp cuts that just took effect? Or, wider still, one for all the budget stunts that have cost the economy an estimated $700 billion? And why stop there? How about one for the financial crisis? Or for the mother of all unapologized-for misdeeds, the Iraq War? Wouldn\u0027t it be great if accountability were contagious?Comments (127)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Climate science is being attacked by deniers who want to sow seeds of doubt as we try to educate our children about how our way of life -- including our fossil fuel habit -- is affecting God\u0027s earth through climate change. Children, the ones who will most be affected by climate change, are the ones who most need to how to combat it.Comments (626)Judi DenchActressTo me it is astounding that Philomena Lee still has her strong religious belief even after everything that was done to her. She questions things and is very open in speaking about her experiences, but her faith is unshakeable -- as strong as it always was.Comments (44)Barack ObamaPresident of the United StatesMillions of LGBT Americans go to work every day fearing that, without any warning, they could lose their jobs -- not because of anything they\u0027ve done, but simply because of who they are. It\u0027s offensive. It\u0027s wrong. And it needs to stop, because in the United States of America, who you are and who you love should never be a fireable offense.Comments (582)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Lila Shapiro takes us to Shannon, Mississippi -- population 1,753. That\u0027s where businesswoman PJ Newton tried, unsuccessfully, to open what would have been the only gay bar in a 100-mile radius on the town\u0027s main street.Comments (47)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowIt was Colin Archipley and Liz Perez, a Navy veteran who survived the bombing of the USS Cole, who showed me a much better use of the energy I had been wasting on raging against military policy decisions. Use your time, passion, and power to help.Comments (82)Kirk DouglasActorEveryone talks about Fiddler on the Roof but did they ever see a fiddler on the roof? I had the sculptor Aris Demetrios make a sculpture of a fiddler and I placed it on top of my roof. At night the lights make it visible to everyone.Comments (49)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundNine-year-old Jaime Gordillo Villa was born in the United States and is a good student who has gotten awards for both good grades and behavior. He wants to be a lawyer when he grows up to help immigrants and others who need help.Comments (217)Benjamin Todd JealousPresident and CEO, NAACPIn a democracy, the people can win every time -- but only if we are organized. Today, when I reflect back on my half-decade at the helm of the NAACP, I am deeply proud of what we have accomplished together as we organized our communities.Comments (24)David FurnishFilm director and producer; Chairman, Elton John AIDS FoundationThe government regulatory bodies were insisting on such a slow testing process that they were effectively condemning to death anybody who was diagnosed with HIV. As far as the authorities were concerned, the message was, \"Go die quietly.\" They clearly hadn\u0027t met Larry Kramer.CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowAs the week began, another \"Obamacare\" horror story hit the press, instigating a fleet of outrage-pornographers to continue self-flagellating and screeching about the disastrous Affordable Care Act -- selectively forgetting about actual healthcare horror stories that existed before the law was implemented.Comments (1,813)Ann JonesAuthor, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027As I followed the sad trail of damaged veterans to write my new book, I came to see how much they and their families have suffered, like Afghans, from the delusions of this nation\u0027s leaders, more powerful and less accountable than themselves.Comments (236)Bishop Gene RobinsonThe Rt. Rev. V. Gene Robinson, Bishop of New Hampshire, USA. Visiting Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress.The debate surrounding the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which just passed in the U.S. Senate has a number of religious leaders arguing against it. Sometimes, Jesus must just hold his head in his hands with embarrassment.Comments (613)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere\u0027s an old saying I learned during the early days of the feminist movement about women working together toward a common goal: \"One is a pest, two is a team, three is a coalition.\" I\u0027ve always liked that comment because it speaks directly to what I believe most deeply about women: that there\u0027s safety -- and power -- in numbers.Comments (20)Al FrankenU.S. Senator from MinnesotaAs we debated -- and ultimately passed -- the Employment Nondiscrimination Act (ENDA) this week, I discovered something fascinating: Americans were frankly surprised to learn that in the majority of states, it\u0027s still perfectly legal to fire someone because they\u0027re gay.Comments (283)Larry KingIconic television and radio interviewer, online at #LarryKingNow on @OraTVOf the six million children around the world with potentially treatable heart defects and no access to care, approximately 6,000 live in Uganda. How great would it be if together, we could put 6,000 candles on a metaphorical cake to brighten the lives of these kids?!CommentsOlivia ColePoet, author, and activistWhat it comes down to is that black girls are missing representations of themselves in positive contexts. When they turn on the TV, they are missing. When they are looking at the cover of magazines like Vogue and Elle, they are missing.Comments (883)Marcus SamuelssonAward-Winning Chef, Restaurateur \u0026 AuthorCharlie Trotter was the consummate chef. As a role model, mentor and great friend to so many of us chefs around the world, he will never be replaced. And for those of us lucky enough to eat at his tables, let\u0027s forever consider ourselves grateful.CommentsMadeleine CrumAssociate Books Editor\"Like\" can serve two important, or at least forgivable, functions. The first is to allow a certain tentativeness to a spoken thought.Comments (343)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkMany of us were excited last night, and that\u0027s a normal sentiment when such tremendous progress took place. But in order to continue on that path of advancement for all, we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent.Comments (50)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Is that a painting -- or a person? Unconventional artist Alexa Meade slathers her subjects with paint, and even dunks them in a bathtub of milk, in pursuit of the perfect portrait.Comments (142)Menachem RosensaftProfessor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsThis sordid tale is of far more than academic interest for me: My parents were imprisoned at Auschwitz. I\u0027d be horrified to discover their uniforms advertised on eBay or anywhere else.Comments (117)Claire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostA younger and much less wise version of myself once had a crush on a certain boy. He was cute, he was smart, and he was just a little bit too full of himself. In other words, he was my Darcy. Whenever we ran into each other, we bantered, exchanged barbs, and even argued. It was fate.Comments (63)Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAs Republican members of Congress demand apologies and administration officials dutifully offer up mea culpas for the botched Obamacare rollout, wouldn\u0027t it be fair to expect just a morsel of apology from the right as well?Comments (12)Paul SlanskyWriter; Contributor to The New YorkerThere comes a time in every day when I think something like, \"I\u0027d love to live in a country where there\u0027s a machine that can measure your soul, and when someone -- someone, say, like a Ted Cruz, or a Michele Bachmann -- falls below a certain level of humanity, he or she is simply not allowed on TV.\"Comments (172)Seamus McKiernanBlog Editor, Special Projects, Huffington PostRap and health consciousness may not seem like a natural duo, but for Khnum Ibomu, or Stic, promoting a healthy lifestyle is a natural extension of the themes of political activism, social justice and personal motivation that run through his music.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027How will the 2016 election be framed? What will be America\u0027s choice? If the coverage of last week\u0027s two big winners offers a guide, the choice will be between \"pragmatism\" and \"ideology.\"Comments (174)Seth Adam SmithBlogger; Editor-in-chief of ForwardWalking.comHaving been married only a year and a half, I\u0027ve recently come to the conclusion that marriage isn\u0027t for me. Now before you start making assumptions, keep reading.Comments (1,191)Colin ColemanManaging Director, Goldman Sachs International Inc.After almost two decades of democracy the world is asking: \"what has Nelson Mandela\u0027s South Africa done with its freedom?\" With the 95-year-old father of the nation ailing, the 52 million South Africans who see him almost universally as a hero are also asking what lies ahead long after \"Madiba.\"CommentsHuffPost Radio, 2013.10.11Dov Fox, 2013.10.11Mike Weisser, 2013.10.11Lawrence Wittner, 2013.10.11Aldo Civico, 2013.10.11Benjamin Rubenstein, 2013.10.11Vicki Cobb, 2013.10.11Lucy Emerson-Bell, 2013.10.11Jill Baughman, 2013.10.11Dave Helfert, 2013.10.11Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"MAG: WARREN 2016 MORE LIKELY IF HILLARY RUNS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
