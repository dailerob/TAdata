{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressA little over a week ago, incumbent Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi made sure that everyone knew that Liz Cheney was going to primary him. This was surprising news, mainly because what would have otherwise been a sleepy 2014 Senate contest could end up being something that the media could monetize for page views and whatnot. And last week, Cheney went ahead and confirmed that she was going to give it a shot. So here we are: The state of Wyoming is now suddenly interesting! And one good reason why this Wyoming primary is going to be very compelling is that it\u0027s the venue for a hot proxy war between Rand Paul\u0027s libertarianish insurgency and the neo-con old guard.Comments (236)Camille SeamanPhotographerThe underlying goal of my work is to help trigger an emotional connection, one that I hope will spark a relationship between the viewer and this planet.Comments (126)Ahmed Shihab-EldinEmmy-Nominated Producer/Host, @HuffPostLiveThe U.S. can continue to portray itself as not taking sides in Egypt\u0027s political turmoil. But instead of wavering and teetering, America should recognize and leverage its influence with Egypt\u0027s military to begin pushing for more transparency and accountability, especially in regards to its brutality and dominance in Egypt\u0027s political roadmap and its economy.Comments (368)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt\u0027s time for broad bipartisan support for critically important investments in young children. And we must get this right for children: not for test makers, not for adult interests, but for children -- especially the poorest children.Comments (98)Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027More lawyers and citizens should be standing up for the jury system. Destroying the jury system is dangerous. Who do you want to decide a case? those who actually heard ALL the evidence and considered it or those who simply picked sides? Trials are not about picking sides.Comments (269)Kate SpencerWriter, producerOur cultural conversation about pregnancy, birth and motherhood is way off from what the actual experience is. And it\u0027s hurting women.Comments (25)Carl JeffersTelevision political commentator, radio talk show host, lecturer, political analystIf President Obama leaves office without being more assertive in using his bully pulpit to try to engage the country in a more permanent and comprehensive understanding of the issues of race, then I believe historians and history will look back on his administration and assert that he missed a great opportunity.Comments (514)Stan GreenbergCEO, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner; Pollster; Co-head, Democracy Corps; Carville-Greenberg MemoWe would all benefit from listening to the voters who may be trying to tell us something about what is happening in Washington and the U.S. Congress. Maybe there is a price to pay for not trying to help our country meet its challenges.Comments (134)Scott ShambergSlightly cynical father of two, marketer, amateur comedian, Chicagoan.Tomorrow you leave for overnight camp, the first time you will be away from home for more than a night and/or not under the supervision of a loving Jewish grandparent.

But Edward Snowden hardly provides the justification.Comments (237)Melanie NotkinCEO Melanie Notkin Media, Inc/Savvy AuntieBeing single is seen as a chronic problem that needs to be solved and those who just had it solved want to share their secret, i.e. the secret to finding love and getting married.Comments (36)José Ramos-HortaFormer President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateToday, I plead with President Taur Matan Ruak and Prime Minister Xanana to let these unwanted, persecuted people stay in our country. Surely, we can share our bamboo roof, a loaf of bread, a plate of rice, cassava, some coconut water with our fellow brothers and sisters from Myanmar.Comments (14)Sarah ErdreichAuthor, \u0027Generation Roe: Inside the Future of the Pro-Choice Movement\u0027\"Want to go to a crisis pregnancy clinic?\" I asked my husband one night during my first trimester of pregnancy. \"No,\" he said flatly. \"Why would we?\"Comments (1,126)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsWith Congress about to head out of town for its summer recess, a Washington-based think tank is ramping up a campaign to foil any attempts to institute a tax on carbon emissions.Comments (318)Martin GarbusTrial lawyer, authorThose in government, both Republic and Democrats, knew exactly what was going on. They knew, ever since the Church Committee of 1975 of decades ago, of the overstepping of our intelligence agencies. We all knew. We just did not pay attention.Comments (68)Peter Z. ScheerManaging Editor, TruthDig.comAmerica\u0027s apparent outrage over the Rolling Stone cover featuring a photo of accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev reveals a great deal about this country\u0027s insecurities and prejudices.Comments (243)Liz GumbinnerBlogger, \"Mom-101\"Mostly we all parent by the seat of our pants, don\u0027t we? I know I sure do. We\u0027re so busy catching up, just checking off the to-do list (or more likely, not checking off the to-do list and just stealthily bumping the task to the next day then the next then the next...), there\u0027s not always time to reflect.CommentsFran LaskerPsychotherapistThere is nothing wrong with wanting to share all the wonderful things going on in your life, but the quest for cyber-validation eviscerates all sense of decorum and sensitivity to others.Comments (36)Isabel Foxen DukeCertified health coach and emotional eating expert.I wanted to get ahead, stand out, be special, and I didn\u0027t see how accepting my body the way it was would get me there. I believed my dreams were 20 lbs. away from me, and what seemed like a forced, new ideal of beauty on a billboard didn\u0027t seem to change that.Comments (105)Joe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorWhen future historians write about America\u0027s long struggle for racial equality, they will include the moment when the country\u0027s first African-American president broke his silence about the 2012 death of young Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida.Comments (64)David DietzFounder, ModavantiThrough the toxic pesticides used in our raw materials to the smog belching from the factories, the storms are becoming demons of destruction.

Not by telling me to ignore what had happened, or to \"give myself a break\" or to \"move on.\" Instead, she put that day in a timeline of a thousand other days, some full of gardening and caring for our neighbors and others full of impatience and crap.Comments (58)J Henry FairPhotographerWe like our steaks and our SUVs, and who wants to be the first to give them up?CommentsEvan D.
