{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027A few weeks ago I was visited in my office by the chairman of one of the country\u0027s biggest high-tech firms who wanted to talk about the causes and consequences of widening inequality and the shrinking middle class, and what to do about it. I asked him why he was concerned. \"Because the American middle class is the core of our customer base,\" he said. \"If they can\u0027t afford our products in the years ahead, we\u0027re in deep trouble.\" I\u0027m hearing the same refrain from a growing number of business leaders. They see an economic recovery that\u0027s bypassing most Americans. They know the U.S. economy can\u0027t get out of first gear as long as wages are declining. And their own businesses can\u0027t succeed over the long term without a buoyant and growing middle class. They also recognize a second danger.No elite voice in this country seems capable of coming to terms with the fact that the Iraq war was \"lost\" the moment it was launched. It was lost because it was based on lies and deception.Professor, historian, authorMy father was gone two weeks when a man I didn\u0027t know -- my mother\u0027s new boyfriend -- pushed the butt of a .22 rifle onto my right shoulder and with his big, dirty fingers folded my slender 4-year-old finger onto the trigger.Writer\"We\" may not have \"lost\" Iraq, but can there be any question that Washington lost in Iraq? American goals in the region went down in flames in a fashion so spectacular, so ignominious, that today nothing is left of them. To the question, \"Who won Iraq?\" there may be no answer at all, or perhaps just the grim response: no one.Editor, TomDispatch.comOne breezy September evening, I gave my mom the verbal OK, my username, my password and my attention.

Drinkers, consider these next time you\u0027re around a Sober Sally.Social Media Manager and BloggerOver the course of our respective careers it has become clear to us that there are two critical factors that can change the current landscape: improving access to capital for women-owned businesses, and creating structures to better enable women entrepreneurs to get the resources and networks they need to thrive.U.S. Senator for New JerseyCEO and Designer, Tory BurchAmericans think it is illegal for politicians to profit personally from their political office. However, the creation of leadership PACs allows members of Congress to sidestep the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, which bans the use of campaign funds for personal use.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityWhereas Cheney could once rely on the Republican hierarchy and a US national media to take note, now the former vice president is forced to scramble for hits on YouTube, his inane ramblings on foreign policy, the Obama administration and the crisis in Iraq competing unsuccessfully with the latest J-Lo album teaser and a video on how dogs react to humans barking.US Editor, The Huffington Post UKIf something is wrong in one part of our life, it will consume our thoughts. We are good at hiding this and being productive regardless, but it\u0027s still there, nibbling at the back of our minds until we can get home, collapse on the couch and give it our full attention.Journalist, blogger, rugby player and college student, while maintaining sobriety.We\u0027ve had wars on drugs, on poverty, on cancer. We\u0027ve had so many such wars that even our metaphors are now locked and loaded. Meanwhile, the guys with guns continue to wage their very real wars at home and abroad. Before we retire \"war as metaphor,\" however, we should wage one last conflict: a war on guns.Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusYou\u0027ve read the hyperbolic promises fat loss supplements often make, accompanied by before-and-after pictures of a former overweight person who used that product and now looks absolutely fabulous.

CTQ Collaboratory, Kennedy Center/Stephen Sondheim Inspirational Teacher Award 2013; Red Sox MV Educator 2013Thanks to Vladimir Putin and the conflict in Ukraine, Russia watchers, once again, are a red-hot commodity, appearing as guests on American TV networks, trying to explain to confused anchors why Putin\u0027s doing what he\u0027s doing.Shorenstein Center fellowAlthough soccer has lagged behind other sports, such as baseball and basketball, in making broad use of data and analytics, the 2014 World Cup brings up numerous examples of data making an impact on many different aspects of the game.Research Analyst, Center for Data InnovationPsychological scientists are very interested in \"chronotypes\" -- a jargony label for early birds and night owls. Now, it appears, our sleep and waking habits may actually shape our character, influencing our very judgments of right and wrong.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027This anonymous little store will endure as the truest testament of what was there and all that was lost. It stands as the purest expression of memory possible: A memory encased in continuing function at the service of architecture and its modern demands.Former President, The Institute of Classical Arhitecture \u0026 ArtIn my reading of scripture, God simply does not have a lot to say on the specific topic of marriage. Marriage in the Bible is just a part of the stories, not the moral of them, and it was a completely different institution from our modern images of just, loving, equal romantic relationships.Pastor, The Church of the VillageAt \"press time,\" Gemma is almost 5 years old. I\u0027m writing you this letter because, while I love my daughter with all my heart, and I\u0027m trying really hard to be a great mom, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m doing most things wrong.WriterFirst, find who his or her biggest corporate donors are.

Has he recently signed a letter or released a statement opposing EPA curbs to coal-plant emissions?Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressEvery recruiter I have spoken with strongly disagrees with the one-version-of-your-resume-is-fine philosophy. They believe that resumes should be customized to the opportunity the job seeker is applying for.Online job search expert, Job - Hunt.org writerYes, the Vergara plaintiff team has used lots of civil rights rhetoric, and the court leads its ruling with a quote from Brown v. Board. But if this is about civil rights, it\u0027s through a funhouse mirror.Director, National Education Policy CenterWe cannot allow this madness to progress further than it already has. Having a functional, fit body cannot become the \u0027privilege\u0027 of the upper classes, or of celebrities who can afford personal trainers and daily deliveries of perfectly balanced healthy food.Journalist and author of Gross Misconduct - My Year of Excess in the CityWith so many campaigns to finance, and so many lucrative post-political opportunities out there, this kind of corporation-coddling shouldn\u0027t be a surprise. And it\u0027s not.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourIf we can use food processing, marketing and engineering to create the ideal Dr. Pepper, I believe we can also use these tools to help people eat healthy.

And at these green spaces, there\u0027s more to do than simply lay on the grass or go for a bike ride; we\u0027re talking hot-air balloon rides, dancing en masse, and sipping a beer in the sunshine.CondeNastTraveler.comThis time no one is talking about \"boots on the ground\" -- yet -- but starting with air strikes could easily lead to deeper U.S. involvement once it is clear that bombing is having no effect.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CENTER OF NATIONWIDE \u0027CRIMINAL SCHEME\u0027?",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
