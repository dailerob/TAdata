{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOAs we\u0027ve recently seen, Barack Obama is not immune to the seductive call of the Conventional Wisdom sirens. And it\u0027s a call that\u0027s only going to get louder. He\u0027ll hear it from the chorus of pundits standing outside his window. He\u0027ll hear it from some of the advisors inside his campaign. He\u0027ll hear the siren call from inside his own head. So, to counter the conventional wisdom pundits, the cautious campaign advisers, and his inner cautiousness, I\u0027m offering Obama seven tips for staying true to the message that took him from longshot to presidential frontrunner -- and for avoiding the fate of the many before him who fell prey to the misguided belief that the path to the White House runs down the middle of the road. Here they are.Read Post | CommentsBIONathan Gardels, 07.02.2008The North Koreans want the sanctions associated with being on the terrorism list removed. The U.S. Congress won\u0027t remove those sanctions without verification. That is the way it ought to work.Read Post | Comments (24)BIODavid Rees, 07.02.2008How DARE left-wing pacifist Wesley Clark suggest that riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down doesn\u0027t automatically qualify someone to be president? It automatically qualifies you to be anything.Read Post | Comments (71)BIOJason Linkins, 07.02.2008Joe Stephens\u0027 article in today\u0027s Washington Post broadly insinuates wrongdoing on the part of Obama, and not only fails to make its case -- it mendaciously avoids even mounting a case in the first place.Read Post | Comments (103)BIODavid Donnelly, 07.02.2008McCain\u0027s policy ignores the problem with having a campaign run by corporate and foreign lobbyists: they are happy to abandon their lobbying work temporarily to get valuable chits with the potential future president.Read Post | CommentsBIORobert Creamer, 07.02.2008Though the failures of the \"War on Drugs\" are more silent and insidious than the president\u0027s dramatic failures in the Middle East, the two have much in common.Read Post | Comments (70)BIOJim Wallis, 07.02.2008My relationship with the Bush White House ended after my public criticism of the path to war in Iraq. Yet I continued to support the idea and promise of the faith-based initiative.Read Post | Comments (253)BIORobert S. McElvaine, 07.02.2008Five years ago, when Bush said \"bring \u0027em on!\", he was inviting Iraqis to try to kill American troops. Few things a commander-in-chief could say would be as reprehensible as this comment.Read Post | CommentsBIOAndy Borowitz, 07.02.2008Suspicions about Sen. Obama\u0027s true motives have been building over the past few weeks, but not until today have the bloggers called him out for betraying the Democratic Party\u0027s losing tradition.Read Post | CommentsBIOSeth Grahame-Smith, 07.01.2008Call it what you want: arrogance, a jinx -- but let\u0027s be honest with ourselves -- this thing is over. McCain won\u0027t just be defeated, he\u0027ll be crushed in a way that redefines the political map for the next 25 years.Read Post | Comments (366)BIOLincoln Mitchell, 07.02.2008Clark\u0027s recent comments about the relevance of McCain\u0027s service has generated enough controversy that the broader point about what kind of foreign policy experience we should look for in a president has been lost.Read Post | CommentsBIOArlene M. Roberts, 07.02.2008I decided to compile a list of top things Obama can do to advance women\u0027s rights when he becomes president. Here\u0027s the final tally.Read Post | CommentsBIOPaul Waldman, 07.01.2008There\u0027s a myth out there that McCain is reluctant to exploit his Vietnam POW story for political advantage, so modest and full of integrity is he. Nothing could be further from the truth.Read Post | Comments (189)Jake Goldman, 07.02.2008Paul Abrams, 07.02.2008Robert Scheer, 07.02.2008Ira Forman, 07.01.2008RJ Eskow, 07.01.2008Steven Weber, 07.01.2008Robert L.
