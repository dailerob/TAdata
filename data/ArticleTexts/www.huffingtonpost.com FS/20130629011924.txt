{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Madeleine M. KuninFirst Female Governor of Vermont; Marsh Scholar, University of VermontThe belief that same-sex couples have the civil right to be protected by the constitution has been affirmed. These landmark decisions have an impact far beyond the rights of married couples. It tells all gay and lesbian men and women, and their children that they have a legitimate place in society. They do not have to hide, as they once did in deep dark closets. Yes, 37 states have passed laws which prohibit same-sex marriage. Some will continue to do so, regardless of the court\u0027s decisions. But the trajectory is in the other direction, propelled by young people who are more gender blind than many of their elders.Comments (18)Thu-Huong HaEditorial projects editor, TEDA total stranger helped Hyeonseo Lee pay her mother and brother\u0027s way out of jail as they fled from North Korea. Now, four years later, Lee has been reunited with that stranger, getting the chance to thank him in person.Comments (119)Mary Anne PetrilloSr. Marketing Manager, Cisco Corporate Social Responsibility \u0026 Executive Producer, GETideas.orgAs I watch the unfolding story of cyber outlaw Edward Snowden skipping around the globe, I\u0027m struck by the talented young man who employers \"fought over,\" despite the fact that he had no formal STEM education. While many young people today are brought up with some innate sense of these skills, as Snowden was, the National STEM Conference in Austin last week dared us to imagine the innovation and creativity that could come from this future generation if they were provided the formal education to reach their full potential in these fields.Comments (10)Janus AdamsEmmy Award-winning journalist, historian and producerYou are suffering because you refuse to understand that lives have been lost to the \"I is what I is\" mentality in which you take such pride.Comments (528)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowChicanery and complex scheming in politics isn\u0027t anything new, but the intensity and frequency -- not to mention the broad-daylight hubris of it all -- by the Republicans this week has been extraordinary to behold.Comments (175)Les LeopoldAuthor, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)America is the richest country on Earth. We have the most millionaires and the most billionaire. This opulence is supposed to trickle down to the rest of us, improving the lives of everyday Americans. Unfortunately, it\u0027s a lie.Comments (505)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s special Fourth of July issue, Saki Knafo looks at the Americanization of one of the Middle East\u0027s most traditional dishes: hummus. Elsewhere in the issue, we feature a photo essay of Americans as seen from the backs of their t-shirts. And we\u0027ve gone all in on features about America\u0027s culinary traditions from clambakes and cocktails to ice cream and a survey of American foods that, alas, aren\u0027t really American.CommentsKatie CouricCancer Advocate, Host of “Katie” and Award-Winning JournalistMore than 50,000 Americans are expected to die from colorectal cancer this year alone. We need to reduce that number by seeing that everyone who should be screened for colorectal cancer gets screened.Comments (28)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The battle over immigration reform is often about economic fear -- fear that immigrants are hurting the economy for native born Americans. But that fear is based on several economic myths.Comments (144)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundToo many seem to believe that anyone who is serious enough about suicide to use a gun would find an equally effective means if a gun were not available. When it comes to guns and suicide, especially in young people, there are things we can do.CommentsLincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityThis entire episode has been bad for the U.S. for several reasons, but one that has been largely overlooked it the extent to which it makes the U.S. look weak.Comments (447)Mohamed NasheedFormer President of the Republic of MaldivesBad energy policy is not just polluting our planet; it is polluting our politics, and warping international relations. It is the invisible force holding nations in thrall to dictators, causing conflicts and repressing human rights.Comments (26)Bianca BoskerExecutive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostThe same devices we use to keep in touch with one another -- and to make ourselves available at all times -- are coming to our rescue when we want to avoid each other.Comments (39)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe logical conclusion of this reasoning is that if the government could have enforced arranged marriage with a federal law, it should have, since no one could predict the outcome of these newfangled romantic-love marriages, which altered the institution of marriage forever.Comments (24)John FefferOpen Society FellowI was nearly at the end of a presentation on the North Korean prison camp system, when the last person in the audience grasped the microphone to ask a question. His question was so unexpected that I was literally blindsided.Comments (11)Meredith MelnickSenior Editor, The Huffington PostMore has been written about Davis than could be read aloud during a month of filibusters, but if we\u0027re to truly know what she, Leticia Van de Putte and the women of Texas are up against, look no farther than Perry\u0027s clueless comments.CommentsCharles Karel BouleyOn-air host, KGO Radio; TV personality, comic, author, actor, writer/producer/director and dog walkerNo, I was not as happy as many others in my community with the ruling from the Supreme Court on Prop 8; but not just because I\u0027m a hater. I understand it\u0027s a victory, a battle won while the war rages. And that\u0027s what I\u0027m most angry at: the way we are fighting the war.Comments (43)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostWhat Rick Perry doesn\u0027t understand is that in attempting to win the battle for SB 5, he\u0027s starting what will be a war for Texas -- and demographics indicate that his side doesn\u0027t have the numbers in the long term.Comments (63)Ardis D. Hoven, M.D.President, American Medical AssociationObesity has been called many things -- an epidemic, a major public health problem, an urgent chronic condition -- but is it a disease? The American Medical Association, the largest physician organization in the nation, has decided that it is.CommentsJohn CorvinoAuthor, What\u0027s Wrong with Homosexuality?Deen\u0027s mistake is not that she once said and did things that most people of her generation and culture have said and done, and which she now regrets. It\u0027s that she seems to remain relatively clueless about why there\u0027s so much fuss in the first place.CommentsNan AronPresident, Alliance for JusticeBy simultaneously moving in opposite directions on fundamental principles of civil rights, this Court has torn a hole in our political fabric, and once again left the nation part equal and part unequal.Comments (51)Alisa WellekDeputy Director, Immigrant Defense ProjectThe final Senate vote on the immigration bill has just been cast. This is a historic moment for the United States, but there remain serious problems with this flawed bill as it stands today.Comments (107)Rachel FarrisNative Texan, Political Hobbyist, Rick Perry ObserverI have been asked if it was planned. The truth is this: When you have no words left, when every word spoken has fallen on deaf ears, when the representative you have chosen to speak is no longer allowed to do so, sometimes all there is left to do is scream.Comments (469)Lori GardTeacher, Blogger, Contributer to Power of Moms Website, Contributer to Yummy Mummy ClubWhen I was about nine years old, a beloved aunt on my mother\u0027s side was involved in a serious, life-altering car accident. And so, to honor her life, as well as to celebrate 39 years of passionate living prior to her accident (while connecting her 39 years with my own years of life), I came up with the following list.CommentsCarl SandlerCEO, MISTER appIn preparation for the big day, I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about my disenchantment with Pride and what the day means to me. Surprisingly, like a drag queen putting on heels for the first time, I\u0027ve readjusted my stance a bit.CommentsJanis PowersBlogger on political and social issuesWe hear the harrowing tales of North Korean refugees and we want to help. Yet our ability to comprehend the dynamics in the Korean peninsula is limited by the fact that we are half a world away.CommentsReince PriebusChairman, RNCCongress will soon leave town for their July 4th recess. They\u0027ll be celebrating Independence Day, but the Democrats in Congress aren\u0027t leaving those with student loans much to celebrate.Comments (68)Leslie A. DachExecutive Vice President of Corporate Affairs, WalmartEvery company -- as we\u0027ve discovered -- has to work to overcome barriers and perceptions that work against cleaner technologies.Comments (16)Steven RaichlenGrilling Authority, www.barbecuebible.comPulled pork is ridiculously simple to make, but it looks and tastes like you\u0027ve been cooking all day.CommentsBob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveWhat\u0027s happened in Texas graphically illustrates the choice facing America. We can adopt an extreme pro-business strategy and subordinate worker pay and safety. Or we can adopt a strategy that puts people first.Comments (83)Forrest PritchardSeventh generation farmer, author, Gaining Ground, A Story of Farmers’ Markets, Local Food and Saving the Family FarmHow can we really know what\u0027s \u0027expensive\u0027 or \u0027cheap\u0027 until we recognize that grass-fed and grain-fed beef are distinctly different products? Here, a professional farmer redefines the term \u0027Value Meal.\u0027Comments (160)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe million-plus practicing lawyers and their many bar organizations should be on the ramparts defending against the insidious rejection of due process, probable cause, habeas corpus and privacy.Comments (30)Chris Weigant, 2013.28.06Shira Lazar, 2013.28.06Lauren Heineck, 2013.28.06Eileen Ogintz, 2013.28.06Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.28.06Polly Campbell, 2013.28.06James Marshall Crotty, 2013.28.06Tom Farrey, 2013.28.06Rich Polt, 2013.28.06John Arensmeyer, 2013.28.06Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"LET\u0027S GET HITCHED!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
