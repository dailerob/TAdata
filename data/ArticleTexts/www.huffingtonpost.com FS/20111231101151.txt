{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow at the Cato InstituteA decade ago President George W. Bush chose arrogance over humility as his foreign policy. Since then virtually every Republican presidential candidate has embraced his philosophy of endless war: in effect, the GOP mantra is \"we\u0027re all neoconservatives now.\" But can the Republican Party any longer be taken seriously on national security issues?
