{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Three pieces of seemingly good economic news dominated the headlines last week. The official unemployment rate dropped to 7.0 percent, its lowest level since 2008. The GDP growth rate for the third quarter was revised upwards to an impressive 3.6 percent. And while money markets briefly lurched downward out of fear that the good news would cause the Fed to slow down its program of massive bond purchase, quite possibly raising interest rates and aborting a stronger recovery, the markets quickly shook off those fears. Investors and traders evidently concluded that the economy had found a Goldilocks spot of not too cold and not too hot. Stock indexes closed the week only a shade below their historic highs. Should we be encouraged? Is this, at long last, the recovery of broadly shared prosperity we\u0027ve been waiting for? Not yet, I\u0027m afraid.Comments (135)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersFor many years the American Right -- and many of the most powerful elements of corporate and Wall Street elite -- have conducted a war on public employees. It\u0027s time for Progressives -- and Americans of all stripes -- to wake up and smell the coffee.Comments (625)Jeana Lee TahnkTech enthusiast, writer for Parenting Magazine, Cool Mom Tech and MashableWhile we\u0027re moving in the right direction when it comes to overall energy efficiency, there\u0027s a lot more we can do to cushion the impact of our ubiquitous tech usage. Here are ways we can continue to positively impact our Earth and ensure that our resources are preserved for many future generations to enjoy.CommentsKirk DouglasActorToday is my 97th birthday. I am a lucky man. I\u0027ve been married to my wife, Anne, for 60 years and she continues to captivate me. When you get to be 97, you can reflect on the lessons you\u0027ve learned in almost a century of life.Comments (130)Nancy Altman and Eric KingsonImagine that an employer wishes he hadn\u0027t paid you so much in the past, so he goes into your bank account and takes what he wants. Sound outrageous? That\u0027s essentially what the federal government may be about to do to its workers. And the rest of us may be next.Comments (500)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAmericans have been fighting in Afghanistan for longer than the Civil War, World War I, and World War II combined. America has overstayed its welcome. It\u0027s time to go home.Comments (158)Lyz LenzWriterI realize I\u0027m writing a defense of consumerism. A treatise on spoiling. But it\u0027s one day. One day I can say \"yes.\"Comments (18)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsGiven the planet needs to transition as quickly as possible away from coal and natural gas to carbon-free energy to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, who would be against renewing wind\u0027s tax credit? The Koch brothers, that\u0027s who.Comments (52)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsI love them to death. I am a proud father. I am honored that God gave them to me. I am overjoyed. I am in awe. I am in love. I am happy. But my kids do not MAKE me happy.Comments (93)Suzy StrutnerFellow, Huffington Post TravelMinutes after landing in the South, I realized I was somewhere very, very different from California or New York.Comments (78)Alan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"While those horrible blue-staters are doing all they can to stop patriots like Sarah Palin and her Tea Party friends from celebrating Christmas, try being a Jew during Christmas in America. And see if you can find anything to eat besides General Tso\u0027s chicken.CommentsDeborah MunnMother of plaintiff in LGBT discrimination caseThe decision that Judge Spencer made has renewed my hope that no other couple in Colorado will face discrimination by a business owner based on their sexual orientation. It was never about the cake. It was about my son being treated like a lesser person.CommentsSimon SinekOptimistMandela, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi all went to jail instead of abandoning their beliefs. Our politicians seem more keen to abandon their beliefs to stay in office.CommentsChase MadarLawyer, writerAmerican over-policing involves far more than the widely reported up-armoring of your local precinct. It\u0027s also the way police power has entered the DNA of social policy, turning just about every sphere of American life into a police matter.Comments (40)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is important, and JP Morgan should be nailed for bribing Chinese officials. But, if you\u0027ll pardon me for asking, why isn\u0027t there a Domestic Corrupt Practices Act?Comments (145)Leah BerkenwaldCollege Wellness Educator and Health Communication SpecialistWhile some use selfies to subvert dominant paradigms, many young women are using selfies in a manner that, like fat talk, extols the thin-ideal and Western beauty paradigm, continues the normalization of body image dissatisfaction, and reinforces the idea that you must self-denigrate in order to fit in and receive positive affirmations from your friends.Comments (16)Jay Scarfone and William StillmanAs a follow-up piece for all of you dedicated Ozophiles, here are a few more intriguing tidbits about this movie classic. Be sure to look for them on your next trip down the Yellow Brick Road!CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgIt\u0027s amazing how a little sunlight will change the behavior of some of the biggest names in corporate America -- sunlight here meaning greater transparency and accountability.CommentsJeffrey Ann GoudieFreelance writerLet\u0027s move past the stubborn resistance to the cure of the ACA. Let\u0027s get over the thoughtless scapegoating of Kathleen Sebelius. Let the healing begin.CommentsElizabeth GrossmanAuthor of \u0027Chasing Molecules\u0027 and \u0027High Tech Trash\u0027After paying for housing, utilities, transportation, food -- and Walmart\u0027s most basic health insurance -- a single person living in a relatively low-cost community would have about $395.50 to cover the rest of the month\u0027s expenses; a parent with a 6-year-old, about $143.10.Comments (224)Will BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027The Nelson Mandela of the 21st century is right here, right now. We just can\u0027t see it. We\u0027re too busy spitting on him and calling him a terrorist.Comments (21)Madeleine M. KuninFirst Female Governor of Vermont; Marsh Scholar, University of VermontWhat was it about this man that makes him the obvious, and for many of us, the only hero of our time? On one level, he was saintly. On another, he was practical. He wanted to create harmony.CommentsKathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027You have to ask yourself if you\u0027re in an organization where your preferred style of politics is suited to the prevailing one and whether you\u0027re willing and able to adapt. Are you where what you have to offer adds value, where what you have to say is heard, and where your management/leadership skills have been duly noted?CommentsLincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityCalling Mandela a Communist or a terrorist shortly after his death is mean-spirited, but it is a bigger condemnation of the moral blindness of much of U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War than it is a criticism of Mandela.Comments (46)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersVoters have a right to know where the allegiance of their lawmakers\u0027 lies. They should be asking if their elected representatives have sworn to serve ALEC first. And if so, those should be the first to go.Comments (19)Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe credible forecast for the next 20 years presented by the IEA is one of macro stability in global energy markets, even as rolling adjustments are made to significant innovations and shifts at both the supply and demand side of the equation.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027We\u0027ve heard what Israel Prime Minister and members of the U.S. Congress think about the interim nuclear deal the Iranian government concluded with the P5 1. What we don\u0027t know is how the Iranian people will react?Comments (85)Michael KaiserPresident, John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing ArtsThere will be so much written about Nelson Mandela in the wake of his passing -- about his personal history, the struggle for equality in South Africa, his political contributions -- but, I fear, there will be little discussion about his impact on the arts of South Africa, and the world.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Faith leaders and young Dreamers are joining this historic fast on behalf of immigrant families who suffer because our leaders refuse to address a glaring problem with obvious, common sense solutions. It is politics, and politics only, that stands in the way of progress.CommentsTommy G. ThompsonFormer Gov. of Wisconsin and Sec. of the Department of Health and Human ServiceWhile the Affordable Care Act continues to badly stumble out of the gate, it is instructive to look at the last major change to our health care system -- the addition of a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program.Comments (57)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThey have lifted millions of poor families and children out of poverty but now are under assault by political extremists. We must stand up and refuse to let them turn the clock of progress backwards.Comments (240)Gigi Yeoman, 2013. 9.12Susan Bulkeley Butler, 2013. 9.12Obadias Ndaba, 2013. 9.12Mark Nepo, 2013. 9.12Micah D.
