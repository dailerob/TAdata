So go ahead and tune that out for a night and take in another -- far more appealing -- spectacle in which people pretend to be something they\u0027re not. My predictions: Best Picture: Argo. Best Director: Ang Lee. Best Supporting Actor: Robert De Niro. Best Supporting Actress: Anne Hathaway. Best Actor: Daniel Day-Lewis.
