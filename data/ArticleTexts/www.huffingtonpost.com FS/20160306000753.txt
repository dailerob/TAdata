{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn an analysis of Justice Scalia\u0027s votes in twenty of the Court\u0027s most important constitutional decisions between 2000 and 2013, which dealt with such diverse issues as the 2000 presidential election, gun control, voter disenfranchisement, affirmative action, search and seizure, abortion, due process for persons suspected of terrorism, takings of private property, the death penalty, campaign finance regulations, the freedom of religion, and the rights of gays and lesbians, every one of Justice Scalia\u0027s votes in these cases tracked perfectly the conservative political position. Despite all the talk of originalism as a principled mode of constitutional interpretation, Justice Scalia\u0027s votes make clear that originalism had little, if anything, to do with his actual decision-making.The identity politics of whiteness, intensified by a time when there have been no economical alternatives on the table, may have closed that door for tens of millions. Whether you can bring yourself to care about them or not, that is a bad end to a bad story.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027I\u0027m a lifelong resident of Flint, Michigan, and a lifelong fast-food worker. That means my tap water is toxic, and my paycheck is too small to afford a safe alternative.Taco Bell employee from Flint, Mich.The Harvard Gazette has released a series of articles on inequality in America. They describe Harvard University scholars’ efforts across a range of disciplines to identify and understand this nation-defining and dividing concern and possible solutions.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe media can act shocked about Trump failing to quickly and very clearly denounce David Duke and the KKK and their support for him, but they didn\u0027t seriously ask the more important question: Why do the advocates of white supremacy like and advocate for Donald Trump?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThis is too important a national race to let slide by without getting engage. Progressives should support P.G. Ohio Democrats must vote for him. We should all contribute what we can. He is the ascendant Obama coalition; let\u0027s make sure he ascends right now.Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Writer for Salon.comThis has been one crazy political week. It has been so tumultuous and, in some ways, so calamitous for the Republican party, that we may be witnessing a fatal rupturing of the GOP.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027This farce has gone on too long. The sophomoric Republican debates have gone from bad to worse and last night\u0027s \"Cock Fight\" debate simply catapulted the candidates even further down in the credibility and respectability department. This is about electing a leader, not about the size of anyone\u0027s manhood. Stick to talking about politics, policies and your stance on national and international issues.Managing Editor of Blogs, Huffington Post CanadaIf dinnertime is getting a little ho-hum and you find yourself making the same five meals over and over again, it\u0027s time to spice up your repertoire. From Sausage Lasagna to Pecan Crusted Chicken Tenders, these tested and perfected recipes will have your family excited for supper again.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomLife is busy, and it seems to whirl by faster every day. We all try to do a million things at once, and sometimes it works out. But active, effective listening isn\u0027t something you can do on the fly. It requires a conscious effort.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.International Women\u0027s Day is coming up on Tuesday, March 8 is International Women\u0027s Day and it is time to take a look at where we are.Journalism/English teacherHowever you felt about the Oscars, it was a clear sign of progress that the month-long controversy over the Academy\u0027s lack of diversity was front and center during the telecast -- not just begrudgingly alluded to as has happened with other controversies in the past.President and CEO, National Council of La RazaAlan Grayson, the liberal champion of the House, the member of Congress with the largest base of small donors, the Congressman who passed more legislation than anyone other Representative, is again in the news. And not because he\u0027s eleven points ahead in the polls to be the Democratic nominee for Marco Rubio\u0027s Senate Seat in Florida.Attorney, writerThe political class is awash in self-serving theories to explain the rise of Donald Trump. While some of these theories can explain portions of Trump\u0027s appeal they are not the whole story. These are age-old grievances.Immigration Policy Analyst, Cato Institute\u0027s Center for Global Liberty and ProsperityHillary Clinton\u0027s camp (and the camp followers at the Washington Post and Fortune magazine) has made a remarkable discovery: National health insurance (aka Medicare-for-All) hurts poor people. How is that possible? It\u0027s not.Professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College; Lecturer in Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramProfessor of Public Health at CUNY and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramDonald Trump, his supporters proudly declare, tells it like it is. So what, exactly, is \"it\"? Muslim throngs celebrating 9/11? Black-on-white crime? Hordes of rapists from Mexico?Legal affairs reporter at the San Francisco ChronicleOur common dream is the only antidote to the common nightmare already in the works. But to become an effective antidote we need to join forces. We need to overcome the usual tendency of progressives to fall prey to the sirens of discord.Former Finance Minister of GreeceNow, I am a science writer, not a political pundit. To my eyes, Donald as tumor is a more apt metaphor than the party leadership might wish to acknowledge. What is cancer, after all? It\u0027s one of our own, gone wild. It has the same DNA as any other cell in our body, but it refuses to play by the rules.Science and Religion Correspondent for the Humanist MagazineFrom doing taxes to painfully shielding your eyes when you realize how much of your paycheck goes to brunch, being an adult is kind of a twisted yet satisfying experience. If there is one thing that triumphs over paying bills or sitting in a desk chair all day in the hierarchy of adulthood quandaries, it\u0027s making friends.Lifestyle writer and founder of CupOfCharisma.com, sharing lessons in style, social good and the twenty-something’s guide to life.Falling in the middle, both in body and with how I dress, is what makes me comfortable. I feel attractive when I take time to do makeup or sculpt my facial hair, I feel desirable in a flippy skirt or click-clacking boots.Advocacy writer, femme transman, and formerly homeless queer youth from rural Montana.Trump\u0027s performance last night reminded me of Richard Nixon\u0027s infamous answer to David Frost about Watergate: \"When the president does it, that means it\u0027s not illegal.\"Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceIt\u0027s so ironic that a culture that cares so much about concepts like honor does so little to actively address affronts on their dignity. Asian culture emphasizes stability, but seems to undervalue the sanctity of feeling safe and empowered in one\u0027s own skin.Student, Yale UniversityThe U.S. is once again in the midst of an inward turn. Unlike the disconnection following the First World War, America\u0027s growing national deficit in the capacity and will to engage other people not like them is not the innocent confidence of a rising power but the false bravado leading one to its fall.Colonel, U.S. Army Civil Affairs (ret.), Author of Travels with Harley - Journeys in Search of Personal and National IdentityLearning to recognize our own internal experience and then setting boundaries in a way that honors our internal experience, helps us solidify our sense of self with the external world. It also helps create less stress and more balance in our relationships.Self-Love Coach, teacher, and writer. Founder of JenniferTwardowski.comThe hard-bitten, corporatist Democrats are moving Hillary Clinton through the presidential primaries. They are using \"Republican-speak\" to beat down Sanders as favoring more taxes, and they may unwittingly be setting the stage for a serious split in the Democratic Party.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorBeneath the white sheets of racism, you often find an integrationist, more scared of losing an election than following a conscience.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaThere were more male body parts discussed in the most recent #GOPDebate in Detroit, Michigan than one might have expected in a presidential debate forum. From the perspective of feminist body theology, this was enormously revealing of actual issues at stake in this presidential election.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryFor a politician or a journalist, there was a time when citing the classics -- as long as it wasn\u0027t done in a pedantic or pompous manner -- was a mark of wisdom and experience. If a candidate or reporter does it today, there\u0027s a good chance they\u0027ll be trolled and ridiculed for high-handed pretension. Cue Donald Trump shouting, \"Loser!\"Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.American voters would do well to heed the lessons of failure and anarchy in Iraq and Libya. They would do well to think hard before signing onto an encore presentation of U.S.-sponsored violence in the name of freedom in the Middle East.Teaches international relations at Northwestern UniversityI am a busy parish priest half-way through Lent -- so I quite frankly did not have time this week to write about what it means to be prayerfully pro-choice... again. But the orchestrated efforts to turn back the clock on women\u0027s reproductive freedom left me no other principled choice.Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.With Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley\u0027s approval ratings faltering in a new poll on his role in obstructing the Supreme Court nomination process, Democratic challengers like state Sen. Rob Hogg are inspiring a groundswell of new support for a suddenly competitive election battle.Author of \"Damnatio Memoriae: A Play, Una Commedia,\" www.jeffbiggers.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
