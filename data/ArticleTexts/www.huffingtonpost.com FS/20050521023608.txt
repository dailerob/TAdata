{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaYesterday, I raised the question whether military commanders going to the New York Times with their doubts about the Iraq war effort would begin to force our political leaders to take off their rose colored glasses. The story fell into a media black hole… from which our bloggers are making a valiant effort to extricate it. Today, David Sirota, Rep. John Conyers, and Michael O’Hanlon weigh in, while Nathan Gardels focuses on the larger consequences of America’s loss of its “soft power” (which shockingly cannot be laid be laid at Newsweek’s doorstep). And be sure and check out the offerings of first-time HuffPost bloggers Peter Bart, Bill Hillsman, Dr. Soram Khalsa, and Alex Matthiessen.05.20.2005 Adam McKayIf Republicans are upset about the comparisons between Darth Vader and George W they had better stay away from any movie dealing with power and corruption run amok or movies about weak sons who lead with arrogance...read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Simon JenkinsFrom my brief time in Saigon I recall the Americans governing with some competence until the very end. No one who has visited Baghdad can be anything but aghast at the incompetence of the regime that the Pentagon put in place. This has nothing to do with the justification for toppling Saddam. From day one it was just sheer, ideologically-driven, neo-conservative incompetence.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Arianna HuffingtonAt a news conference yesterday, Condoleezza Rice was asked about the New York Times story depicting U.S. military commanders as increasingly pessimistic about the outcome of the war in Iraq. Her answer was a model of obfuscation with more than a hint of that Bush administration specialty -- complete and unrelenting deception. So, as a service to those who prefer their leadership straightforward and candid, I’ve taken the liberty of translating her response from Modern Bush-speak to plain English.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Geoffrey R. StoneWhen was the last time you saw combat footage of American soldiers wounded or dead? When was the last time you saw footage of Iraqi civilians inadvertently killed by American fire? Of course, such images are deeply painful. But they are critical to the proper functioning of a self-governing society. Such images do not exist, however, in the American media.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Catherine CrierIf we want a Theocracy in this country, then ignore the assault on our nation’s judges. If you believe in the Republic that our Founding Fathers bequeathed, then prepare to battle for the one remaining branch of the government that has not yet been co-opted -- the federal Judiciary.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Peter BartThe only ripples were stirred by Lars Von Trier, the noxious Dane, who turns out art films about America’s moral failings. His latest, Manderlay, serves as a reminder that Von Trier could use a year at the UCLA Film School.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Rep. John ConyersWhen persons in the military expressed their concerns before the war about the need for hundreds of thousands of troops for indefinite duration, they were ignored or ridiculed, but of course, they have been proven correct.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Jerry and Joe LongSatellite photos indicate North Korea may be preparing to detonate a nuclear bomb. Apparently they show a giant hole having been dug then refilled, and what may be some sort of reviewing stand.

This is the same Secretary of Defense who led America into a war in the Middle East. Knowing that, are we really surprised that things aren\u0027t going so well over in Iraq?read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Nathan GardelsThe US has discovered that by acting in Iraq without the legitimacy conferred by consent of global public opinion, the political objectives for which our military might was deployed, and for which we are draining our treasury, cannot be met.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Alex MatthiessenUnfortunately, the spirit of Jack Welch is alive and well at America\u0027s most profitable corporation.

I still think that together with our Iraqi friends we will \"win,\" but only if victory is defined in a much more measured and sober and relative way that we would have liked two years ago.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Jim LampleySome of the most revered players in baseball, beloved for their hustle and commitment, were juiced to the teeth on greenies every time they wore the uniform. It was one way of conquering a persistent hangover -- and in a world where some of the people were drunk half the time, and half the people were drunk all the time, that was a daily priority for players, managers and executives as well.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Danielle CrittendenA Senate aide who blogged about her sexual exploits with assorted staffers is now being sued by the counsel for the Judiciary Committee\u0027s antitrust subcommittee for revealing details about their affair -- including “spanking and hair-pulling” during sex. Ah yes, the casual Hollywood reader will think -- hotbed as usual over there.
