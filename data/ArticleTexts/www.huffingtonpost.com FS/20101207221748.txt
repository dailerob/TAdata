{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Anyone who knows me well... or even barely knows me... or has just been a regular reader of my posts will attest to my profound attachment to my BlackBerrys. Indeed, the fact that there is an \"s\" at the end of that last sentence speaks volumes. I once described my \"whirlwind relationship\" with my \"constant companion\" as \"taking up more and more of my time, energy, and focus.\" After I passed out from exhaustion and broke my cheekbone, one of the sacrifices I made in an effort to find more balance in my life was to go from having three of the devices to only two (I hate to confess that I\u0027m back to three!). So, as you can see, my BlackBerrys mean a lot to me. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so excited that HuffPost\u0027s new BlackBerry app is finally here.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 12.07.2010Senior Political Editor, The Huffington PostBy staking his next two years on hundreds of billions of dollars of new or renewed tax cuts Obama is alienating his base in a way that could make him what Carter was: a one-term, ineffective \"outsider\" president.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 12.07.2010Chief Economist and Economic Policy Adviser to Vice President Joseph BidenA framework is emerging from the negotiations between the administration and the Congress on what to do about the expiring Bush tax cuts.

The Republican Party has only one core value: massive economic benefits for the wealthiest Americans. And they\u0027ll sacrifice the welfare of everyone else who is gullible enough to vote for them in order to get it.Read Post | CommentsKaren Kelly, 12.07.2010Food and health writerThere is a lot of innovation going on in the realm of school lunches, none of it having anything to do with food safety bills or mandates from lawmakers. In fact, government is where the least amount of innovation is happening.Read Post | CommentsAndy Borowitz, 12.07.2010Comedian and creator of BorowitzReport.comDifferences over his religious orientation have been a sore point between the president and his Republican foes, but in agreeing he is a Muslim, Obama is sending a clear signal that he is trying to find consensus.Read Post | CommentsJonathan Bernstein, 12.07.2010President, Bernstein Crisis Management, IncAs a former intelligence operative, the ongoing release of formerly secret U.S. government documents by WikiLeaks has hit home with me on multiple fronts.
