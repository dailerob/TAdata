{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Daniel Ochoa de OlzaFrom wsj.com/APAP/Paul DrinkwaterBrenner\u0027s handling of Woodward combines sloppy, credulous reporting with a starry-eyed adulation. Call it Schlock and Awe. For instance, Brenner quotes Ben Bradlee saying: \"That Armitage is the likely source is a fair assumption.\" Only trouble is, Bradlee says Brenner isn\u0027t quoting him accurately: \"I have not told a soul who it is.\" Misquoting sources, Marie? I thought only bloggers did that. When the Post\u0027s Jim VandeHei tried to reach Brenner for comment, he was told she was traveling in India and unavailable. I know Brenner and Woodward like kickin\u0027 it Old School, but even in India there are such things as cell phones and the Internet (just call Dell customer service if you don\u0027t believe me).READ POST | comments (15)03.15.2006 Robert ScheerIf such constant mayhem is taken as a sign of progress, three years after the U.S. invasion, then Bush surely will be thrilled by what the future holds.READ POST | comments03.14.2006 Marty KaplanThis country is right now more politically engaged than at any time since the \u002760s.READ POST | comments (31)03.15.2006 Eric BoehlertAn updated CBS News poll indicates Bush is still stuck with 34 percent job approval.
