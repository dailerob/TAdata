{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week in Davos, one of the hottest topics cutting through the cold mountain air was health care. The debate has now moved beyond how to best pay for hugely expensive interventions -- that\u0027s sick-care -- to true health care for individuals, communities, countries and our planet. At the moment, 75 percent of U.S. health care spending is on chronic, preventable diseases -- many of them related to stress. For example, diabetes now afflicts over 340 million people worldwide. That\u0027s not sustainable, so we need to redefine what we think of as successful outcomes, both in health care and in our lives. Health is our most precious natural resource. Whether it\u0027s a renewable or non-renewable resource is up to us. (You can find HuffPost Live\u0027s on-location Davos coverage here.)CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutragePeople ask me all the time why we don\u0027t have a revolution in America, or at least a major wave of reform similar to that of the Progressive Era or the New Deal or the Great Society. The answer is complex, but three reasons stand out.Comments (250)Bernice A. KingChief Executive Officer, The King CenterOn the national holiday today, The King Center is calling for a moratorium on violence. Specifically, we are asking that there be no shots fired -- no shooting off at the mouth with our tongue, no shooting off physically with our fists and no shooting off of any type of gun!Comments (11)Anne-Marie SlaughterPresident and CEO, The New American FoundationReports, panel discussions and media reports still focus overwhelmingly on measuring the participation of women in what has traditionally been the world of men. But it is equally important to measure the participation of men in what has traditionally been the world of women.Comments (76)Arianna HuffingtonGreetings from Davos. I\u0027m here for the 44th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, where the theme is \"The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business,\" and we\u0027ve chosen this moment to launch The WorldPost, in partnership with the Berggruen Institute on Governance.Comments (94)Yo-Yo MaGrammy Award-Winning CellistA new way of thinking is possible, a new consciousness -- perhaps a new Enlightenment -- that brings the arts and science back together.Comments (29)Richard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupTo finally break the fossil fuel cycle that leads to warming and war, new and disruptive energy technologies (from advanced renewable fuels, to electric cars that leave their petrol-powered rivals behind, to more efficient, lower-cost solar cells and intelligent ways of heating and cooling buildings) need adequate financial backing.Comments (84)Paul PolmanCEO, UnileverPermissible growth in the future has to be based on sustainable and equitable models. Having acquired a license to operate, it\u0027s time for business to earn a license to lead.Comments (22)Kate QuickMother, writer, professorI was an adjunct English professor in Alaska with a baby due. If I needed to take maternity leave, it would be unpaid. But the choice that I faced -- either care for my newborn or go broke -- was never really a choice. At 27, I was a college professor on food stamps.Comments (316)Walter IsaacsonPresident and CEO, Aspen InstituteInnovation is wonderful, but on its own it\u0027s not the holy grail. Other things matter just as much in creating a great company or product, most notably execution and focus. Apple excels at these things. That\u0027s why I use an iPhone and iPad. Innovation without execution produces footnotes to history, such as the Xerox Alto and Star.Comments (22)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCelebrity is a narcissistic business. Since Bieber entered the business, his career has grown at the hands of music executives who stood to make a profit on his popularity, not his mental health.Comments (38)Larry Summers and Gavin YameyIf we make the right investments in the health sector today, we could achieve universally low rates of infectious, maternal and child deaths by 2035.CommentsIsaac SaulHuffington Post\u0027s Innovation TeamWe\u0027re still a country that isn\u0027t ready for lower-class Americans from neighborhoods like Compton to succeed. We\u0027re still a country that can\u0027t decipher a person\u0027s character. We\u0027re still a country that can\u0027t accept someone if they\u0027re a little louder, a little prouder, a little different.Comments (1,127)Fernando Henrique CardosoFormer President of Brazil; Member of the Berggruen Institute’s 21st Century CouncilEveryone sees the gap between the claims of the Brazilian miracle and the reality of daily life. People want more accountability to fix Brazil\u0027s institutions.Comments (17)Melinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationOver the next decade, nearly 1 billion women will enter the global workforce. This could be great for the world. If these 1 billion women are allowed to apply their ingenuity and skills and talent to their fullest extent, they will make everybody\u0027s lives better.Comments (15)Kumi NaidooExecutive Director, Greenpeace InternationalEven faced with weakening demand prospects, outdated investment patterns are driving fossil fuel companies to waste trillions of dollars in developing reserves and infrastructure that will be stranded as the world moves beyond 20th century energy.Comments (141)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFifty years after President Lyndon Johnson declared a War on Poverty, the United States is still not a fair playing field for millions of children afflicted by preventable poverty, hunger, homelessness, sickness, poor education and violence in the world\u0027s richest economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $15.7 trillion.Comments (108)Sen. Charles E. SchumerDemocratic U.S. Senator from New YorkIt\u0027s time we deal with the reality that, for the first time in American history, middle-class American incomes have declined for almost a generation. If middle-class incomes continue to decline, we will have a dramatically different America, a less optimistic, more sour America.Comments (195)Wadah KhanfarJournalist; President, Sharq ForumThe events of the past decades have been a reflection of the interests of the superpowers and the balance of global politics. The past few years have proven that the Middle East\u0027s dependence on international powers is no longer fruitful.Comments (35)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWhat do you give a Wall Street CEO who supervised a unit that lost $6 billion through incompetent and illegal trading, and whose reign of mismanagement has cost his institution $20 billion in the last year -- a figure that would\u0027ve been much larger in a less morally compromised regulatory environment? If you\u0027re the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase, you give him a raise.Comments (41)Sarah BrownCo-Founder, A World at School; Executive Chair, Global Business Coalition for EducationBasic education and learning is too often neglected when dividing up aid and young boys and girls are held back for years - if not a lifetime - by the absence of good schooling mindful of the life skills and employment skills that will serve them well.CommentsMark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVI bet you think the mobile Internet is open. That if you write the next great mobile app there is nothing that can stop it from fulfilling its destiny. That if you create a mobile content app that blows away Netflix there is nothing that can stop it. Wrong.Comments (20)James MooreBest selling author, TV political analystThe story is true. Every damned bit of it. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth, Texas was a single mother. A teenaged mom. She lived in a mobile home. And went to Harvard. Also, she got help along the way. Can you believe it?Comments (177)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Having \"the talk\" with her 8-year-old daughter was awkward enough. Then they decided to look up cats mating on the Internet, and soon actress and author Julia Sweeney was an inch away from showing her daughter porn. Don\u0027t miss the hilarious (and heartwarming) results.Comments (17)Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business and Global News Editor, The Huffington PostThe WorldPost is a product of the idea that the most foundational challenges of our era, from the perils of climate change to the epidemic of youth unemployment, can neither be understood nor addressed through the traditional frame of the nation state, but require collective efforts spanning geography and cultures.CommentsGlennon MeltonBlogger, MomasteryIf we don\u0027t want throwaway answers, we can\u0027t ask throwaway questions. A caring question is a key that will unlock a room inside the person you love.Comments (36)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerUNESCO has long had on its schedule an exhibit titled \"People, Book, Land: The 3,500-Year Relationship of the Jewish People with the Holy Land.\" The content of the exhibit had been approved by archaeological experts and met all pertinent scientific criteria. But less than a week from its opening, the exhibit was suddenly put on hold.Comments (26)Scarlett JohanssonActressWhile I never intended on being the face of any social or political movement, distinction, separation or stance as part of my affiliation with SodaStream, given the amount of noise surrounding that decision, I\u0027d like to clear the air.Comments (19)Dr. Karin L. SmithsonTherapist, Educator, Writer, Motivational Speaker. Spirituality Expert. Brave Mom of 3. DoctorKarin.comWhile these years may feel surprisingly more pressurized than your 20s, they will unexpectedly also bring the most personal growth in your life. You\u0027re no longer allowed to kick back in flip-flops on the bench -- you\u0027re in the big leagues, in cleats with a giant 3-0 on your back. This is where you find out who you are and who you really want on your team.Comments (31)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersIn West Virginia after a cavalier chemical company poisoned the drinking water of 300,000 people, the corporate-hugging, right-wing extremist group Americans for the Prosperous congratulated itself for doling out bottled water one day.Comments (130)Jenny G. PerryAuthor, The JennifersI lost 50 pounds in six months. I changed how I ate and worked out like crazy. It was great and I felt pretty... except for a few ugly things.Comments (363)Paul Abrams, 2014.26.01Larissa and Michael Milne, 2014.26.01Steve Rosenbaum, 2014.26.01Ingrid Newkirk, 2014.26.01Connie Lawn, 2014.26.01Dr. Reese Halter, 2014.26.01Magda Abu-Fadil, 2014.26.01Tim Giago, 2014.26.01Harlan Green, 2014.26.01Clint Edwards, 2014.26.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"BRRRRR: -43° WIND CHILL COMING",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
