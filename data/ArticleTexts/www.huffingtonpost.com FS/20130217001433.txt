{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis Valentine\u0027s Day, a movement of mothers and others chose to tell their members of Congress that these families are not alone -- we are all left broken-hearted by their losses, and millions of Americans are ready to stand with them and demand change. Shannon Watts said, \"A child\u0027s heart is her mother\u0027s pulse ... Today, I am here for every beat lost. And I am here to tell every mother who has felt her core broken because of senseless gun violence -- I am here to tell you that there is an army of mothers behind you.\" We all need to join the army fighting to say no more gun violence in our homes, schools, neighborhoods, and communities. Our nation\u0027s children and families have suffered enough broken hearts. We are determined that children get a vote on common-sense gun safety measures to protect them from guns. Take action with us.Read Post | Comments (82)Mary Roach, 02/15/13authorIn 2009, I walked onto the TED stage and gave a talk that included video of a Danish pig inseminator.

And for much of that time -- as with any long-sought dream -- the fantasy never quite lived up to the reality. All of that arguably changed in 2008, when Hillary Clinton came within arm\u0027s reach of the Democratic nomination for the presidency.Read Post | Comments (138)Erin Cooper, 02/16/13Doctoral candidate in Clinical Psychology, Temple UniversityUnderstanding why some women fake orgasm as a method of avoidance while others fake orgasm to make their sex life more fun is important.
