{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Will BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Let\u0027s be clear -- this is about Obama... and it is about much, much more than Obama. It is yet another example of how the national security state that has dominated our political life since World War II has corrupted the American soul. It is exactly what Philadelphia\u0027s own Benjamin Franklin tried to warn us about -- trading liberty for security, and geting neither. To the conservatives reading this, who warn so much about big government running amok... here it is. To the liberals reading this, who thought that one man named Barack Obama could change the system, he couldn\u0027t. Only we, the citizens, can truly change things.Comments (422)Michael BurnsVice Chairman of LionsgateTo paraphrase former President Ronald Reagan, anyone who doesn\u0027t recognize that our financial community still has heroes, even in this troubled and cynical era, isn\u0027t looking in the right place, and Jamie Dimon at the helm of JPMorgan is foremost among them.CommentsRic TelfordVice President, IBM Cloud ServicesIf you\u0027re like most of us, you always keep your smartphone or tablet within arm\u0027s reach and have become accustomed to limitless access to information anytime and anywhere from an array of aesthetically designed, simple and user friendly apps.CommentsBarbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistSometimes in the face of national tragedy, politics should take a backseat. The hypocrisy of turning Benghazi into a deliberate cover-up scandal is preposterous at a time when the nation faces so many serious problems.CommentsJamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorAngelina Jolie\u0027s revelation today, done with eloquence and dignity and grace, is remarkable both in its message and its import to the world of women. Pro-action.Comments (25)Jason AlexanderActorGood men and women in the Middle East are struggling for their futures, their dignities, and their security. We have a role to play, no matter how small. I have taken a part, but this cast is large. And the players need you. It is a great story. You really shouldn\u0027t miss it.Comments (89)Dr. Judith RodinPresident of the Rockefeller FoundationWe can\u0027t know for sure when or where the next crisis will hit -- only that it will. But despite these certainties, most cities are woefully unprepared to manage these shocks. Now is the time to help cities build resilience.Comments (17)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Many of you soon-to-be college graduates are determined to make the world a better place. But many of you are cynical about politics. You see the system as inherently corrupt. You doubt real progress is possible. Let me remind you: Cynicism is a self-fulfilling prophesy.Comments (54)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAs an adult, it can be hard to meet new people and start new relationships -- especially after a divorce, after the kids are grown, after being laid off or becoming a widow. But it may not be as hard as you think to make new friends in mid-life and beyond.Comments (27)Sen. Barbara BoxerU.S. Senator from California; Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeEfforts to manufacture a controversy surrounding this tragedy are not only disingenuous, they are dangerous because they take our eye off the ball and divert attention from where it should be: protecting the American people and those who bravely serve our country overseas.Comments (892)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe problem here isn\u0027t the president. It\u0027s the Supreme Court\u0027s Citizens United decision and subsequent tax law written by Congress that gives these groups tax exempt-status.Comments (56)Danielle HarkPhotographer, Mental Health Advocate, Founder of BrokenLightCollective.comSomehow, my fur-baby can always gets me to smile, no matter how miserable or stressed I feel. I am not alone. It turns out that all pets, not just therapy pets, can help your mind, body, and spirit. Here are a dozen reasons why.CommentsNaomi AngelWriterAngelina Jolie has just gone public with the news that she had a preventative double mastectomy. As a BRCA1 gene mutation carrier, she had an 87% higher risk of breast cancer. In January, I also found out that I have the BRCA1 gene mutation. But for me, the test came late, after I had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer that had already spread to my lymph nodes.CommentsRev. Barry LynnExecutive Director, Americans United for Separation of Church and StateIt appears that officials at the IRS can\u0027t get motivated to work resolving an actual problem and are instead spending time embroiling themselves in embarrassing scandals. Perhaps it\u0027s time to bring in some people who not only understand the law but are willing to enforce it.Comments (28)John KerryU.S. Secretary of StateOur warming planet means the Arctic\u0027s ecosystem is experiencing significant, rapid shifts with far-reaching consequences. All of the changes in the Arctic must change the way we approach the region.Comments (74)Patricia Leavy, PhDAuthor of American Circumstance and Fiction as Research PracticeJolie used her standing as a worldwide \"sex symbol\" to debunk the myth that women become any less beautiful, feminine or sexy when they lose their breasts.CommentsMorris W. O\u0027KellyHost of \"The Mo\u0027Kelly Show\" on KFI am640 and XM Satellite RadioIt\u0027s about time Bill Maher responded to Wayne Brady. Not because he owes Brady any sort of explanation or apology for his previous jokes about Brady supposedly lacking black male fortitude. Maher needs to respond because he has never been reticent to respond to the likes of a Donald Trump or Sarah Palin.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027How astonishing to have a public servant who actually cares to inform the public about the inner workings of the system of crony capitalism that has wedded big government with big business. This comes at the expense of the free market that corporate lobbyists delight in invoking as an ideal while they subvert it as a reality.Comments (98)Tommie SunshineDJ, Producer and ArtistTo make something so beautiful out of the chaos of our world is rare. I\u0027m in awe of this album and not afraid to say so. I remember what my life was like before this album and can only dream of what its going to be like after.Comments (46)Dr. Judson BrewerAssistant Professor of Psychiatry, Yale School of MedicineOur optimal psychology is one where we\u0027re fully engaged in life -- effortless, joyful, and as a result extremely productive. And as our neuroscience advances, we can build tools to help all of us move into this optimal state more and more.CommentsJoe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorThe U.S. Justice Department\u0027s secret seizure of two months of phone records for reporters and editors of the Associated Press is a reckless violation of the First Amendment. There is nothing more sacred in the American democracy than freedom of the press.Comments (16)Jeffrey SonnenfeldSenior Associate Dean and Lester Crown Professor of Management Practice, Yale School of ManagementJP Morgan\u0027s Jamie Dimon is just the lastest to be ensnarled by the annual \"separate the roles\" campaign -- independent of lack of evidence these arrangements improve governance.CommentsJoan GarryNonprofit consultant and activistIt is my firm belief that leaders sometimes overstay their welcome. Organizations change and need different kinds of leadership. Sometimes an organization can become overly identified with its leader, rather than its mission, which can jeopardize the organization\u0027s stability or sustainability.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesMinnesota\u0027s marriage equality win also represents a stinging blow to the anti-gay evangelical right. This is the state that brought us Michele Bachmann, an evangelical Christian who made her political career by pushing boilerplate religious bigotry about gays.Comments (44)AmirahBoston nonprofit providing aftercare for survivors of commercial exploitationThe idea of creating safe homes in the U.S. that provide whole-person restorative care for adult trafficking survivors is surprisingly new, so there\u0027s no proven blueprint for how to do it.CommentsDavid VineAssistant Professor of Anthropology, American UniversityContractors are hardly alone in raking in the dollars from the Pentagon\u0027s baseworld. Pentagon officials, military personnel, members of Congress, and lobbyists, among others, have all benefited -- financially, politically, and professionally -- from the giant overseas presence.Comments (26)Gilles JacobPresident of the Cannes Film FestivalUnlike the works of great directors, a festival film is designed for the sole purpose of being selected for one of these international festivals, of which the Cannes Film Festival is the nec plus ultra, if we are to believe Plato of Athens.CommentsFoodbeastCooking a fresh ear of corn on the cob can be cumbersome... if you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing.Comments (69)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaLike Whitewater, look at how the Benghazi production now comes complete with dubious claims about whistleblowers (and their unreliable advocate), controversial talking points, and leaked Congressional testimony used to whip up media anticipation.Comments (19)Leighton WoodhouseCo-founder, DogParkMedia.comFwd.us\u0027 lobbying approach reflects the worst of DC-style politics: it\u0027s cynical, it\u0027s transactional, and it\u0027s predicated on using critically important social and ecological issues as pawns in a chess game. Worse for Mark Zuckerberg, it\u0027s ineffective.CommentsArpita MitraHalf the Sky Movement campus ambassadorDifferently-abled women are a doubly discriminated category in India: for being women and having a physical or mental impairment.CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg School\"Heat-Trapping Gas Passes Milestone, Raising Fears,\" ran the headline on the front page lead story in Saturday\u0027s New York Times, with this sub-head: \"CO2 at Level Not Seen in Millions of Years, Portending Major Climate Changes.\" A headline like that normally turns up in comic books and superhero movies, not in the paper of record.Comments (777)Katerina Sokou, 2013.14.05Jason Hughes, 2013.14.05William Bradley, 2013.14.05Michael Hobbes, 2013.14.05Richard Bangs, 2013.14.05Maritza Stanchich, Ph.D., 2013.14.05Peter Staley, 2013.14.05David Trumble, 2013.14.05Edward Goldman, 2013.14.05Daniel Nisman, 2013.14.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"DRAMA DAY",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
