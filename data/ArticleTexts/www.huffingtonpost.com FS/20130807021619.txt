{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostIn some accounts, Jeff Bezos is just another unfathomably rich guy loading up on a vanity toy that\u0027s landed in the bargain bin. \"Some billionaires like cars, yachts and private jets,\" sniffed Andrew Ross Sorkin. \"Others like newspapers.\" Others treat the deal like an act of charity, likening Bezos to the robber barons of the late 19th century who plowed their monopoly winnings into public goods like concert halls and universities. Perhaps this is \"the beginning of a phase in which this Gilded Age\u0027s major beneficiaries re-invest in the infrastructure of our public intelligence,\" suggested James Fallows. That would be wonderful. Yet maybe the deal signifies something much simpler and more hopeful for the state of American journalism: Perhaps Bezos thinks he can make money by producing and distributing consequential work.Comments (33)Dr. Karin L. SmithsonPsychotherapist and spirituality expertAs college doors start to swish and swing open, slurping young people back in for fall classes, I feel compelled to put my hand up and say, \"Wait, you forgot something.\"Comments (238)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe only way in which to effectively push back this ever more carefully orchestrated Tea Party tide is to challenge Republican assertions and policies with the same degree of self-confidence and directness with which their advocates present them.Comments (438)Michael CalderoneSenior Media Reporter, The Huffington PostHow did the Times miss out on Washington Post sale scoop when profiling publisher?CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Instead of spending August on the beach, corporate lobbyists are readying arguments for when Congress returns in September about why corporate taxes should be lowered. But they\u0027re lies. You need to know why so you can spread the truth.Comments (1,422)Deborah YaffeAuthorThese days, it seems, everyone\u0027s a Jane Austen fan. Who doesn\u0027t love the witty repartee of the sparring lovers in Pride and Prejudice -- you read it back in high school, right? -- or the date-night pleasures of the Emma Thompson movie made from Sense and Sensibility?Comments (39)Max Jacobson-FriedWriter, CrossFitterI\u0027m not sure when it happened, but at some point in my mid to late 20s, I reached a state of general malaise. I knew CrossFit had something to do with doing 100 pull ups and throwing up, which was a fancy stretch from my normal routine. I signed up for an Intro course and jumped right in.Comments (17)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027There is no transparency whatsoever in the trading of oil on the commodity exchanges. We don\u0027t know who is taking positions and for whose account.Comments (225)Adam J. RoseHuffPost Standards EditorI don\u0027t know enough about hacking and odds are you don\u0027t, either. I set out to learn more at DEF CON, a hacking conference with enough discussions on civil liberties, ethics and philosophy to delight a liberal arts major. Charged to \"live an examined life,\" we should all think harder about our technology, privacy and security.CommentsEllen KellnerMindful thinker and authorAt the office, are women powerful because of their destructive power? Are we all nothing more than Disney villains? When I\u0027m powerful, is it the result of being caustic? I hope not, but in hearing my colleagues pronouncement, \"is it true?\"Comments (20)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostWhy does an organization formed when the idea of paying money to attend a sporting event was in its infancy still operate under the same (now completely out-of-context) model?Comments (29)Adam HanftPolitical Columnist, CEO of Hanft ProjectsThe decision to close as many as two dozen American embassies and consulates, based on intelligence reports about an upcoming Al Qaeda attack (or attacks), is nothing less than a public relations and recruiting bonanza for them.CommentsDavid J. EicherEditor-in-Chief, Astronomy magazineWhat UFO proponents and sci-fi story writers too often fail to appreciate is the distance scale of the universe. It is HUGE. REALLY HUGE.Comments (165)Randy Pipkin2013 National Chair, Breakthrough ALSDear Mr. Rodriquez, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge your recent comments about \"fighting for your life.\" I would like you to understand what that profound, emotional claim truly means.CommentsAdam GreenCo-founder, Progressive Change Campaign Committee (BoldProgressives.org)Open Debates will be a game changer in our political process -- ensuring that questions get asked that the public actually cares about. What starts in Massachusetts will hopefully become the norm for local, state, congressional, and even presidential debates in the future.Comments (32)David HalperinAttorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgWhat will become of the rest of the old Washington Post Company, publicly traded and run by the Graham family? The fact is that the Post Company was already dominated, in several respects, by its lucrative Kaplan education subsidiary.CommentsRohin DharCo-founder and CEO, PriceonomicsLet\u0027s agree that diamonds are bullsh*t and reject their role in the marriage process. Let\u0027s admit that as a society we got tricked for about century into coveting sparkling pieces of carbon, but it\u0027s time to end the nonsense.Comments (581)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterWhy am I here? Because no country on earth today reminds us moderns of the responsibility of man to his fellow man and no country has bounced back from a genocide with such determination, forgiveness, and resilience.CommentsJeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027I am glad Bezos is using his wealth to save a great and necessary American institution. But I hope and pray the real value he brings is his entrepreneurship, his innovation, his experience, and his fresh perspective, enabling him to reimagine news as an enterprise.Comments (37)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhich Jeff Bezos will publish the Washington Post: the anti-tax libertarian or the iconoclastic business thinker? We don\u0027t know. But either way, the plot thickens.Comments (71)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillNow that Commissioner Selig has thrown the book at Alex Rodriguez, it is past time for sports media to stop giving a free pass to the man who is most responsible for having allowed the steroid problem to fester for as long as it did -- the commissioner himself.Comments (150)Ben GreenfieldFitness and Triathlon expert; Get-Fit Guy podcast hostOf course, even the very best flat-stomach workout isn\u0027t going to do much for you if those nice muscles you build are covered with a layer of nature\u0027s comfortable camouflage -- a.k.a. fat.Comments (11)Sean McElweeWriterJesus, as all great reformers have, sided with the oppressed. This new kind of skewed fundamentalism is radically new and far removed from true Christianity. True Christianity offers us a far superior doctrine -- one of social justice, love and equality.Comments (305)Lincee RayTV enthusiastI can forgive ABC for forcing the viewing audience to sit through Chris Harrison masterfully negotiating three hours of mostly fluff, because there were some pretty exciting moments that made me stand up and yell at my own television.Comments (25)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comIt\u0027s harder these days to imagine a use for such a heroically solitary statement -- not in an America in which spying and surveillance are boom businesses, and our latest potential Nathan Hales are corporate contractors, who often don\u0027t get closer to the enemy than a computer terminal.Comments (24)Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mary Anne HittThe Clean Water Act is one of our nation\u0027s greatest statutory achievements. But 40 years after the Act was passed, the coal industry is still polluting with impunity, thanks to a loophole that no other industry enjoys.Comments (33)ShakiraSinger, Activist and Founder of the Barefoot FoundationMy career as a singer has given me my greatest gift of all--my voice. It\u0027s a gift that allows me to express myself as an artist but also one that affords me a platform to shine the spotlight on issues infinitely more important than my own career.Comments (19)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027President Obama seems to think that the country should be thankful to Larry Summers that we didn\u0027t have another Great Depression. This is like telling little kids that if they don\u0027t eat their spinach the bogeyman will get them.Comments (102)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteI endeavor to keep an open mind. After all, anyone can make a scientific discovery. And if that someone is outside the cozy halls of academe, how can they make their case? However, I would like to offer an FAQ service for those who would call or write with extraordinary claims.Comments (43)Ellen DolgenAuthor, \u0027Shmirshky: The Pursuit of Hormone Happiness\u0027Where are my keys? If it\u0027s the umpteenth time you\u0027ve asked that question today, you\u0027re undoubtedly frustrated. Chances are you want to find the cause -- and fix it before you go and lose your keys again!Comments (30)Sean CaseyLiberal MP for Charlottetown, P.E.I.Armed American police officers will now be able to stop Canadians, in Canada, inspecting, checking and asking questions. The Conservatives will tell us that an armed American cop in Canada is all about trade, jobs and security, not sovereignty. If this is true, then can we not expect to see Mounties stopping Americans on the Buffalo side?Comments (738)Adam J. Rose, 2013. 6.08John K. Herr, 2013. 6.08D.
