{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This is the first year I tweeted my way through a long Election Night and Election Morning After. I started things off before the polls closed: \"Going to be a long night. I\u0027ll stay awake by practicing saying \u0027Speaker Boehner,\u0027 \u0027Senator Rubio,\u0027 and \u0027Senator Paul\u0027 with a Greek accent.\" As the GOP wave rolled across the country: \"Haven\u0027t heard a single GOP winner say he/she would touch defense spending. Good luck with that budget deficit.\" When the wave stopped in Nevada: \"I guess we\u0027ll never find out what Sharron Angle thinks of the two wars we\u0027re fighting.\" Then, sifting through the post-election ashes: \"28 Blue Dogs lost. I wonder if they\u0027re now reconsidering their efforts to trim the stimulus and make it less effective.\" and \"Sen. DeMint to Tea Party: \u0027you must now overcome determined party insiders.\u0027 Good luck, Mitch McConnell!\" 140 characters never felt so shellacked.

Turns out, sometimes even if you weren\u0027t the one who broke it, you own it. So it is with our broken economy. Bush broke it, but Obama, underestimating just how broken it is, owns it.Read Post | CommentsSimon Johnson, 11.03.2010MIT Professor and co-author of 13 BankersAfter the strong showing of the Republicans in the midterm elections, the president needs to promote strongly the ideas of Elizabeth Warren -- what we need in financial services, above all else, is much more transparency.Read Post | CommentsSen. Bernie Sanders, 11.05.2010Independent U.S. Senator from VermontIt is outrageous that General Electric/MSNBC would suspend Keith Olbermann for exercising his constitutional rights to contribute to a candidate of his choice.
