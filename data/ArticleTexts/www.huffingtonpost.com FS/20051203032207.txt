{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APPresident Bush was positively giddy during his Rose Garden appearance this morning. After spinning the upbeat economic numbers for the press, the president headed off, ignoring a shouted question about Iraq. And that\u0027s the bottom line for the White House: They might be able to spin the new economic numbers, but they can\u0027t spin the war -- including the news this morning that 10 Marines on foot patrol were killed by a roadside bomb near Fallujah. That\u0027s why now, more than ever, the Democrats need to make 2006 a referendum on the war. Fortunately, they already have a template for success: follow Jack Murtha.READ POST | comments (42)12.02.2005 Harry ShearerSuddenly the floodgates of coverage about the Corp\u0027s culpability have opened. The news was the guilty plea, not the indictment. Tom DeLay must be wondering how he can get that deal.READ POST | comments12.02.2005 David SirotaIs Steny Hoyer stoned on some psychedelic drug? Because that\u0027s the only explanation for the second ranking Democrat in the House saying that things could \"lead to a disaster\" in Iraq.READ POST | comments (18)12.02.2005 Jane SmileyWhat sort of people produce Wal-Mart? Why, people like Junior Jenkins, people for whom cheapness is all, no matter what the cost. Every time Junior sees a Prius (or a working stiff), he sees only a price tag.READ POST | comments (43)12.02.2005 Bruce KlugerPhil Donahue was one of the first talk show hosts to speak out against the Iraq War (summer 2002.) And he got cancelled for it. But he\u0027s still speaking out and wait \u0027til you hear what he has to say.READ POST | comments (21)12.02.2005 Seth GreenlandDid someone appoint Mike Brown head of the FAA when I wasn’t looking?

Virtually all analysts say the jihadists make up only about 4 per cent of the fighters that U.S. forces face. Our real opponents are POI\u0027s (\"pissed off Iraqis.\")READ POST | comments (26)12.02.2005 Laurie DavidFor every week of winter lost due to warming, adult polar bears lose 22 pounds because their food supply is so scarce.

But if history is any judge, what is certain is that we will fight them at some point.READ POST | comments (36)12.01.2005 Hooman MajdAnyone wondering what Karen Hughes is up to these days?
