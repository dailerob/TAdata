{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027As you have doubtless read or seen, Michael Bloomberg, former Mayor of New York, has put out the word that his minions are testing the waters for an independent candidacy. Bloomberg is supposedly the sensible moderate that the county needs, the one that political polarization has kept from the ballot of either party. But that\u0027s not an obstacle that a few billion dollars from the candidate\u0027s own fortune can\u0027t fix. Here\u0027s the problem. Bloomberg is center-right on economics and finance, and liberal on social issues and gun control. There is no clamoring for such a combination, except among fellow rich people. But if the Republicans nominate Trump, Bloomberg might capture a good slice of the moderate suburban vote -- even more so if Democrats choose Sanders. Don\u0027t we need just such a moderate? No, we don\u0027t.We all strive for success, even though what that means for each of us is going to be different. That\u0027s why I\u0027m delighted to announce HuffPost Endeavor, a new section in partnership with Chevy Malibu. HuffPost Endeavor will be a place to both celebrate success and redefine it, by reminding ourselves what it really means to live a good life, to place the satisfaction that comes from hard work and accomplishment alongside the joys that come from small moments, pauses and meaningful connections.Can we bomb a movement that has no nation but definitely has a strong belief system, like we used to have? Haven\u0027t we learned that every bomb creates terrorists?Actor; Founder, The Dreyfuss Civics InitiativeMichigan didn\u0027t have to poison Flint\u0027s children. That was a values choice. And Republican Gov. Rick Snyder values big business more than little children.International President, United SteelworkersAs Egypt\u0027s central security chief declared they \"will not allow another revolution,\" the hashtag \"the people demand the downfall of the regime\" quietly became the top trending topic in the Arab Twittersphere.Writer; Arab Spring activistPaul Krugman doesn\u0027t get it. I\u0027ve been in and around Washington for almost 50 years, including a stint in the cabinet, and I\u0027ve learned that real change happens only when a substantial share of the American public is mobilized, organized, energized and determined to make it happen.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Veterans who have willingly given so much in service to their country should not have to bear the burden of being further stigmatized by your ignorant and foolish statements.Risk management and security expertThis wasn\u0027t an acid flashback, although to my ears it sounded like one. Several months ago, I was with 27,000 people screaming for a disheveled 73-year-old Senator from Vermont. He didn\u0027t look like Mick Jagger. But what Bernie Sanders says feels like the truth. The unbridled truth. And he says it LOUD.Founding member of The DoorsHillary Clinton is wrong when she says that Medicare for all is not achievable. In fact, if she and her husband had embraced the concept in 1993, we would be nearly there today.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksThe tragedy of Flint should never have happened, but at this point, the evidence is undeniable and the suffering is real. Fixing Flint is an urgent priority. Fortunately, (although far too late) the truth has finally sidelined the spin-masters who spent years denying the problem.Executive Director, In the Public InterestOnly recently have academics gotten the ability to use data to test how well legislatures represent the people they ostensibly serve. So far, the evidence hasn\u0027t been kind. That\u0027s academic for: \"American democracy is a joke.\"WriterThe brutal political reality is that numbers and, in this case, tradition, are against Sanders in the states that will determine the Democratic presidential nominee. In the space of three weeks after the New Hampshire primary February 9, eight out of the next 13 open Democratic primaries are in the South. South Carolina kicks off that run. Black voters in that state make up nearly 50 percent of the voters.Author and political analystIf voters want a reformation of government, they must look for more fundamental change than electing a \"strong\" leader.Founder, Leadership for a Responsible SocietyYoung Democratic voters favor Sanders, especially because of his endorsement of Medicare for everyone, more emphasis than Clinton on raising the minimum wage, limiting income inequality, climate change and taking a tougher stand against business and for more regulation. The problem is, as Clinton has been at pains to point out, that the current Congressional realities make those goals unrealistic.Retired producer for NBC Nightly NewsMatalin-Alter debate the pre-Iowa cage-matches. But while GOP bitterly disagrees who\u0027s more loathsome -- Trump (says National Review) or Cruz (says Dole) -- among Dems, it\u0027s who\u0027s more awesome. Isn\u0027t THE variable which Dem likeliest to stop the Far (F)right? Then: Will Flint -- like \"Benghazi\" -- politically go from a place to a piñata?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027New York Times pundit Tom Friedman apparently doesn\u0027t understand that the idea that \"died in 1989\" was Communism. Senator Bernie Sanders, the \"socialist\" he\u0027s referring to, isn\u0027t a Communist.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeHere are 10 success skills you probably weren\u0027t taught, but are completely essential to happy living:Master Certified Coach and founder of Good Vibe UniversityThough for understandable reasons the leading Republican presidential candidates continually emphasize the things that divide them, we would do well to concentrate rather on the things that do not.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThrowing a wet blanket on progressive activists in a primary election season saying they\u0027re \"unrealistic\" when they\u0027re fighting like hell to turn the Bernie Sanders campaign into a grassroots social movement -- the \"political revolution\" Sanders is calling for -- is not only unhelpful to moving the nation forward, but disparages those who make up the democratic wing of the Democratic Party by portraying them as naïve dreamers.Professor, historian, authorToday\u0027s Democratic choices consist of a candidate endorsed by Rahm Emanuel, or Bernie Sanders, a candidate endorsed by 2.3 million contributions from American voters. For Bernie Sanders, the average campaign contribution is less than $30. At one of Emanuel\u0027s Chicago fundraising events for Clinton, admission was $2,500.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comFew of the more than 300 discussions in Davos touched on climate risk, and many participants expressed a fear that flat-footedness was the norm -- not the exception.Writer, Reporter, Pragmatic Tree-HuggerThat Trump thinks his \"fans\" are mindless morons who will blindly follow their Pied Piper like rats into the drowning pool is quite telling. But will they care? Will they finally turn all their \"anger\" on him?Political and Pop Culture AnalystOne might well wonder: just how likely is it that we would be seeing these sort of streaks of record-breaking temperatures if not for human-caused warming of the planet?Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027I refuse to hinder his fondness for certain colors, prevent him from innocently wearing certain clothing or narrowing his creativity because society doesn\u0027t deem it proper or fitting for his gender.Blogger, teacher, soldier, and motherBut for too many, the bed has become a battlefield. Many millions of us struggle nightly with insomnia, nightmares and other sleep challenges. People with long histories of sleeplessness tell their doctors they hate their beds and they often grow anxious as bedtime nears. They pray for a peaceful night while remaining on guard for yet another battle.Sleep and dream specialistYou must nurture yourself and only stay close to people who know how to support you and comfort you. People with OCD whose close companions understand the disease and care for and support you relieve their symptoms more effectively. Get help, care for yourself, and be kind to yourself.Infant-Parent and Child Psychoanalyst; Author, \u0027Unlocking Parental Intelligence: Finding Meaning in Your Child\u0027s Behavior\u0027Although the latest decision does not mean that the courts will uphold the rule, it does mean that the process of implementation will not be delayed by current legal challenges.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteWe must prevent nationality from being dealt with thoughtlessly and keep in mind its particular nature. It does not belong to the State, which shall not dispose of it. Its possession provides access to citizenship. Nationality is the country of a person\u0027s citizenship. And it belongs only to citizens.Former top aide to French President Francois Mitterrand; Founding president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; President of PlaNet FinanceThere is an unhealthy arrogance of certainty permeating our political discourse that says: Only our side is virtuous. Only our side is pure, moral, high-minded, ethical and principled.Columnist, author, and theologianDespite its significance, we are just days away from the \"first in the nation\" Iowa caucuses and the direction of this election is still very much \"up in the air\" and about as confusing as any in recent memory. Iowa, therefore, will be important.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027For more than a year, an entire city was exposed to the risk of lead poisoning. Those children will suffer neurological damage for the rest of their lives. Long after you and I are gone, some of them will still be living a life diminished. No matter what happens now, that cannot be undone.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
