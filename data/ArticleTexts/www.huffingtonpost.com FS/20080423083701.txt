Senator Clinton will continue until at least June -- another two months with Senator Obama dividing his army, so to speak, between Clinton and McCain.Read Post | CommentsBIORobert Schlesinger, 04.22.2008The talking heads are taking the wrong approach to viewing Mrs. Clinton\u0027s Pennsylvania win: The only way she gets the nomination is by way of a historic Obama collapse.Read Post | Comments (97)BIOGreg Mitchell, 04.22.2008Many understate the number of racist Democrats who would tip contests to Clinton. If Obama won or came close in Pennsylvania, that might put the issue to rest. Didn\u0027t happen.Read Post | Comments (78)BIOTom Hayden, 04.22.2008It is as if Hillary is engaged in a toxic transmission onto Obama of every outrageous insult and accusation ever inflicted on her by the American Right over the decades.Read Post | Comments (132)BIOArianna Huffington, 04.22.2008The Neanderthal wing of the GOP has dragged the political debate so far to the right that even Democrats find themselves getting cozy with ideas that not so long ago would have been the exclusive domain of arch-conservatives.Read Post | Comments (118)BIOAndy Ostroy, 04.22.2008With a win in PA, Clinton\u0027s question to the superdelegates will be, \"Are you better off with me or Obama against the Ruthless Republican Attack Machine.\" This Realisticrat already knows the answer.Read Post | Comments (327)BIOSeth Grahame-Smith, 04.21.2008Hillary Clinton will win Pennsylvania. Arguments over the meaning or meaninglessness of her win will dominate MSM and stretch bandwidth to its breaking point. We\u0027ll all lose our minds.Read Post | Comments (576)BIOMatt Littman, 04.22.2008Ed Rendell is to Hillary Clinton as he is to the Eagles-- he cheerleads, he exhorts, he pleads and he is intensely loyal to a team that cannot win and ultimately will break his heart.Read Post | Comments (31)BIOAmy Ephron, 04.22.2008I have a theory that in order to be First Lady you have to have a cookie recipe.Read Post | Comments (36)BIOBen Jervey, 04.22.2008Like so many tools our environmental forefathers handed down to us, Earth Day has failed miserably to adapt and react to the scale of the crises we face.Read Post | CommentsBIONora Ephron, 04.20.2008This is an election about whether the people of Pennsylvania hate blacks more than they hate women. And when I say people, I don\u0027t mean people, I mean white men. How ironic is this?Read Post | Comments (1358)BIOPaul Hipp, 04.22.2008As my home state of Pennsylvania heads to the polls I thought I would post this song. It is based on far too many true stories.Read Post | Comments (12)BIOHowie Klein, 04.22.2008Even among Republicans, even among Texas Republicans, Democrats are finding opportunities where none \"should\" exist.Read Post | Comments (21)Robert Schlesinger, 04.22.2008Bill Maher, 04.22.2008Andy Rosenberg, 04.22.2008Carol Browner and Dan Weiss, 04.21.2008John Javna, Sophie Javna, and Jesse Javna, 04.22.2008Rep.
