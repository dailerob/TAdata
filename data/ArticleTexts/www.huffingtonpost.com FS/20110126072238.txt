{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Obama is a boxing fan. So he knows that he did a clinch Tuesday night. How did the president do this? Well, he capitalized on the obvious opportunity in the aftermath of Tucson to call for peace. He honored the rise of a Republican-led House by delivering the most pro-business speech a Democrat has given, since, well, that a Democrat has given. If the measure of success is the number of times he forced Speaker of the House Boehner to clap, the speech was a raging winner.Read Post | CommentsMark Penn, 01.26.2011CEO, Burson-MarstellerPresident Obama\u0027s speech will poll well; but the failure to tackle the big problems and issues with specific creative ideas means the president and the White House have a lot of work to do.Read Post | CommentsPaul Begala, 01.25.2011CNN political commentatorCritics will no doubt complain that the president\u0027s speech was a laundry list. But when you\u0027re feeling naked, clean laundry is a pretty useful thing.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 01.25.2011Political Reporter, Huffington PostAs far as the facts -- on taxes, stimulus, and health care reform -- go, a lot of Paul Ryan\u0027s State of the Union rebuttal came rebutted-back in advance of its delivery.Read Post | CommentsRep. Chaka Fattah, 01.25.2011Representative, Pennsylvania\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictWhile I applaud my Republican colleagues for engaging in a discussion on the national debt, simple \"back of the envelope\" analysis demonstrates that spending cuts alone will never soundly address this critical economic issue.Read Post | CommentsPaul Helmke, 01.25.2011President, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceHow can President Obama tell us in his State of the Union that \"the dreams of a little girl in Tucson... deserve the chance to be fulfilled,\" without talking about the gun violence that destroyed those dreams?Read Post | CommentsAri Melber, 01.25.2011Correspondent, The Nation; AttorneyGiven the president\u0027s rebounding poll numbers, his measured address is likely to be neutral to positive. The biggest problem, at least for close listeners, was the logical holes in his tax talk.Read Post | CommentsDave Johnson, 01.25.2011Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe way to get out of the debt is to invest in the human capital of the American people and grow out of the debt. The president took us in the right direction tonight, and should be thanked and congratulated.Read Post | CommentsMichael Likosky, 01.26.2011Author of \"Obama\u0027s Bank\"President Obama reaffirmed his economic philosophy in the State of the Union address -- a government that works, invests, delivers opportunity, and that we can believe in. It is a lean government, not a big government.Read Post | CommentsDoug Kendall, 01.25.2011Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterAmerica is great and so were our Founders, but America\u0027s Founders were not perfect.
