{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOWith time running short, Team McCain wants to cover as many fear bases as possible. So along with evoking the Cuban Missile crisis yesterday, the McCain campaign also rolled out a new round of robocalls designed to convince voters that Obama would be soft on \"sex offenders, drug dealers, and murderers.\" Unfortunately for McCain, playing the Be Afraid game has gotten a lot more complicated.

The result is final. Like death.Read Post | Comments (1486)BIOBob Jeffrey, 10.23.2008Who knows today, let alone tomorrow, where solutions to our problems might come from? We have to stop idea racism.
