{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of History and Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York UniversityAs a historian of Cuba, as a Cuban-American, as an American citizen, I applaud President Obama\u0027s change of course on Cuba. Surprisingly, so do my 93 and 88-year old Republican parents in Miami. To say that they love neither Raúl Castro nor Barack Obama is an understatement. Yet, they were swayed by Obama\u0027s plain statement of fact: isolation has failed, and after more than 50 years we cannot reasonably expect it to produce a different result. They are weary, and yesterday they felt a stirring, a faint hope that finally something might move. What exactly will change of course remains to be seen. There is loud (and expected) opposition in some quarters, and questions are sure to arise about the relationship between the new policies and the requirements for diplomatic recognition spelled out in the Helms-Burton law of 1996. At the same time, however, there is bipartisan support for a new approach.It is easy to dismiss the whole matter with some lighthearted head-shaking. But we should take a moment to remember that the reality of life in North Korea is no laughing matter.Advocacy director, Human Rights WatchToday, as The Colbert Report airs its final episode, I\u0027m looking back with gratitude on nine years of great television. I loved being on the show several times, discussing everything from my Greek accent to self-sabotage to the obnoxious roommate living in my head. Here are some of my favorite moments on The Colbert Report over the years.By selling himself as someone who could get things done with Republicans, Obama gave them the power to make him a success or failure. Unsurprisingly, they chose the latter option. Is Hillary Clinton about to make the same mistake -- and will voters buy it if she does?Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourStudy after study confirms that women backstab, undermine and put down one another -- at work, in the PTA, out for drinks -- basically taking every chance they can to act out the movie Mean Girls long past high school.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile technically we\u0027re still dealing with the hypothetical, the speculation-obsessed media doesn\u0027t seem all that bothered by the prospect either. That\u0027s what happens when we treat politicians like celebrities and exchange paychecks for access.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveWhen we asked citizens in Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and UAE whether they believed the Middle East was better off or worse off as a result of the Arab Spring the responses were largely divided.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027I find it hard to believe at first because I don\u0027t feel any different. But then days go by and I begin to feel a buzz around my edges. I realize that I, through no conscious effort of my own, am slowly building another person. My husband and I compare bellies in the mirror every night. I didn\u0027t think it was possible, but I enjoy being pregnant.Founder, Story ClubFrom the report on torture we can draw three lessons. The first is a terrible one, but the other two are encouraging. The first thing the report teaches us is that it is possible for the most prominent intelligence agency of the world\u0027s most powerful democracy to commit torture on a large scaleBernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The negotiations over Cromnibus show why Americans don\u0027t trust the government in Washington. While no sensible citizen wants the Federal government to shut down, most of us are sick of special-interest giveaways. Someone has to stop them.Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveThe policy changes are not a reward for the Castros. They are a recognition that involvement, not estrangement, will foster a productive relationship better able to reach our goals of an inclusive, democratic hemisphere.Deputy Director of the Atlantic Council\u0027s Adrienne Arsht Latin America CenterIf human rights abuses really were the metric by which we decided on trade and travel, the U.S. should be banning Americans from visiting our staunchest allies and our most popular vacation spots (including much of the Caribbean, where homosexuality is illegal, though it\u0027s not illegal in Cuba). It would literally be much of the globe.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe current Ebola outbreak underscores that pathogens remain clear and present dangers to humanity, economic development, and national security in an interconnected 21st century world, and we must remain vigilant against them.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralThere and hundreds of teachings contained in the 4 Gospels of the New Testament, teachings that, if we obeyed, would absolutely flip our lives and world upside-down for the glory of God and the good of all people.Christian writer, activist, \u0026 speaker who seeks to build-bridges across cultural, theological, and political divides.When it comes to holiday entertaining, there\u0027s nothing worse than being stressed out and stuck in the kitchen while your guests enjoy the party. The key is to plan a menu that can be made almost entirely ahead of time. All of these dishes can -- and often should -- be made in advance...Once Upon a ChefThe barbarous targeted attack on helpless children has done what a decade of terrorism couldn\u0027t -- Pakistan reacted venomously. The outpouring of grief for the victims and their families from across the country, the region and world has changed the very paradigm of how terrorism has been tackled by the government.Senior content developer, Geo News, PakistanFor The Interview, it appears for the moment, the show will not go on. It\u0027s hard to know exactly what motivated the theater chains that cancelled the show. The end result is that we have now allowed the government of North Korea to dictate content.President, People For the American WayNo one has all the answers, so whatever a woman who has the BRCA mutation chooses to do requires courage and an element of faith. And a lot of love and support.Medical editor, The Huffington Post; Founder and president, Preventive Medicine Research InstituteIn the next James Bond movie, Bond will be played by Daniel Craig, 46. The Bond Girl? She will be Monica Bellucci, 50. It goes without saying that Bellucci is drop-dead gorgeous and sexy. But she doesn\u0027t look 20 or 30 or even 40. She simply looks like a gorgeous older woman.AuthorIt is both unfair and inaccurate to place all of the blame for unemployment solely on job seekers. Employers are less than perfect, too. In the current job market, technology has changed many of the \"standard\" practices. So it\u0027s a new ball game for both employers and job seekers.Online job search expert, Job-Hunt.org writerVishy Anand could be the Phoenix of Chess. Many times down, but never out. Again and again he rises up to snatch another tournament triumph, another world championship.International Chess GrandmasterIn any case, Washington\u0027s influence is limited: The Sisi regime will do whatever it believes necessary to retain power. Whatever America does, Egypt is likely to end up without liberty or stability. Washington should step back from a crisis that it can\u0027t resolve.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteSeaWorld\u0027s value as a business on the stock market has gone way way down. Well, SeaWorld, now that we have your attention...Associate Director, International Marine Mammal Project, Earth Island InstituteRape culture is living in a society in which your story is dissected rather than heard; it\u0027s being told your inherent, God-given value begins to disintegrate once your story gets uncomfortable and its trajectory skewed.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersChanges in technology are happening at a scale which was unimaginable before and will cause disruption in industry after industry. This has really begun to worry me, because we are not ready for this change and most of our leading companies won\u0027t exist 15-20 years from now.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurNot only have Netanyahu and his cohorts systematically been engaged in rancorous public narratives against the Palestinians, but they have taken action that could only attest to his unwavering commitment to expand the settlements and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe environmental community has a communication problem. The problem lies neither with the validity of their facts and figures nor with the caliber of their experts. The problem is a failure to convey to the American people the relevance of the environment to their everyday lives.Former Coordinator, Value Chain Outreach and Responsible Care for the American Chemistry Council (ACC)Having a clean room can keep you healthier by ridding your space of dust, bacteria, and other stuff that can infiltrate your sleeping paradise. I\u0027ve gathered seven tips that you can easily implement into your routine to make sure your bedroom is in tip top shape.Entrepreneur, CEO at One Mall GroupAlthough we feel safest when we stay within our comfort zones, avoiding new challenges serves as the biggest obstacle to living a full and rich life. Learning to recognize when you avoid change because of the discomfort involved in doing something new could be the first step in a long journey toward improving your life.Psychotherapist and author of 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t DoAs I prepare to retire from NRDC and hand the reins over to our incoming president Rhea Suh, I have been reflecting on how the climate movement can secure the solutions we need to protect future generations from harm. In my view, here are issues we need to keep in mind.President, NRDCThe campaign finance deregulation policy rider to the spending legislation signed by the president is a final recognition by politicians of both parties that nothing will be done to prevent or even slow down the seemingly unstoppable march toward even more money in American politics.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"OBAMA\u0027S REVENGE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
