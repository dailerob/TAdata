{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Charles DharapakFrom almadapaper.comThe White House has decided to stop using the words “insurgency” and “insurgent” to describe rebel forces in Iraq. It\u0027s the president’s latest \"Plan for Victory”: win the war on words. So, in his big speech on Wednesday, Bush went to great pains to rebrand the enemy as “a combination of rejectionists, Saddamists, and terrorists”. Who says Bush’s only strategy is to “stay the course”? Not true. In previous big speeches, the administration set out to dazzle us with impressive-sounding numbers about the rapid growth of Iraqi forces. Now they’ve switched the focus to improved terminology.
