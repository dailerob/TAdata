{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, as anti-American protests continued in Pakistan and across the Middle East, President Obama, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, condemned as \"crude and disgusting\" the video being blamed for sparking the outrage throughout the Muslim world. As well he should. But he had nothing to say about something else \"crude and disgusting\": the drone attacks Pakistan\u0027s Foreign Minister fingered as the primary reason her country has become one of the most virulent anti-American countries in the world -- and which a new study, \"Living Under Drones,\" labeled \"damaging and counterproductive.\" Indeed, the Obama administration has defended its drone policy and argued that there is no \"credible evidence\" drone strikes have led to any civilian deaths -- a claim the study strongly refutes (putting the actual number between 474 and 881). Now, we may not have control over crazies making inflammatory videos, but we do have control over a misguided policy that is killing innocent people -- and fanning the flames of hatred.Read Post | Comments (14)Alec Baldwin, 09/24/12ActorAmerica will never be great again under a Romney administration. It will be great for rich people, while everyone else will be asked to dial down their expectations of what it means to be an American, again.Read Post | Comments (2,117)Pedro Almodóvar, 09/28/12Film director and producerIt sometimes happens that when you\u0027re hard at work making fiction, you get invaded by the feeling that what\u0027s important is happening elsewhere -- something much more powerful than the story that you have been creating, with care and obsession. That\u0027s what happened to me on Tuesday.Read Post | Comments (46)Arianna Huffington, 09/25/12I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of L\u0027Huffington Post, bringing HuffPost\u0027s signature mix of news, blogging, community, and social engagement to Italy. I\u0027ve always had a great fondness for the boot-shaped country and as a Greek, I feel a kinship with a fellow Mediterranean land where someone is always trying to get you to eat something and nothing starts on time.Read Post | Comments (557)Jim Wallis, 09/28/12Christian leader for social changeThe roots of anti-American hostilities in the Middle East run deep (literally and figuratively). Injustices and violence caused by the oil economy have sparked a reaction from dangerous religious fundamentalists in the Islamic world.Read Post | Comments (434)Sarah Brown, 09/24/12Founding Chair, Global Business Coalition for EducationBy uniting corporate leaders from across sectors and across continents, the new Global Business Coalition for Education aims to amplify their voices and bring the dynamism of the private sector to bear on one of the great public policy challenges of our times.Read Post | Comments (33)Paul Rieckhoff, 09/28/12Founder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaWith the stakes this high, service members, veterans and their families deserve transparency and accountability.Read Post | Comments (55)Hilary Rosen, 09/29/12Communications, media and political strategistMitt Romney has everything at stake in this first debate. My first piece of advice for President Obama is to frame virtually every answer as a choice, not a defense. He should also share his best self as emblematic of what is best in America, and he should stay nice.Read Post | Comments (451)Moby, 09/23/12DJ, singer-songwriter and musicianWe are not an \u0027entitled\u0027 class, we are not \u0027dependent upon the federal government\u0027 and we do not consider ourselves \u0027victims.\u0027 We are the hundreds of millions of Americans who had the misfortune of not being born to millionaire parents.Read Post | Comments (1,879)Naomi Wolf, 09/26/12Bestselling author, \u0027The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot\u0027What do I take home from my week in the UK, talking about something as simple and valuable as the new science of female arousal and orgasm? It seems that female sexuality is still such a difficult and contested issue even to think about in mainstream media spaces.Read Post | Comments (166)Gordon Brown, 09/28/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationEducation across the world must be a priority for us all -- an economic and of course a moral necessity.

Where my admiration for Mitt Romney ends is at Owen Roberts International Airport, two miles southeast of George Town, the picturesque capital of Grand Cayman Island.Read Post | Comments (267)Melinda Gates, 09/28/12Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationToday is World Contraception Day. I am celebrating by visiting a cassava farm in Tanzania. It might seem like a strange way to observe the day, except for this fact: the women who do the majority of the labor on small family farms are often the very same women who are asking for contraceptives.Read Post | Comments (22)Tavis Smiley, 09/24/12PBS talk show host, PRI radio hostAmericans seem to be in a perpetual state of denial. About our past, our present and our future. A friend of mine teases that even Americans who don\u0027t live in a state of denial, tend to be frequent visitors. What are we in denial about?Read Post | Comments (212)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 09/29/12Author, research psychologist, and gender scholarWhen your parenting style differs from that of your partner, it can be frustrating at best and destructive at worst, creating dissonance and distance between partners and confusion among the kids. But different parenting styles needn\u0027t spell disaster. Divergent styles can help prepare kids for a world of negotiating various types of people.Read Post | Comments (21)Kenny Loggins, 09/27/12Singer/songwriterEven though you may have put in years of sweat to attain your goal, there always seems to be this bizarre sense of surprise, right at that moment when it all comes true.
