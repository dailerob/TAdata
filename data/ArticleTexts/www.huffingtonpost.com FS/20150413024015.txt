{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Clinton\u0027s strategy isn\u0027t just about winning over the progressive base. It\u0027s about energizing the electorate. If all the people who recognize themselves in this video -- the young, the poor, minorities, single women -- actually get excited and turn out to vote (as they did not do in the mid-term elections of 2010 and 2014), Clinton wins. But the devil will be in the details. Clinton cannot sustain this sort of aspirational politics in the more than 18 months between now and November 2015 without getting very specific. In many ways, the most interesting political contest to come is not the battle for the nomination or even the likely campaign between Clinton and her Republican rivals. No, the contest to watch is the fight between the campaign Clinton needs to wage and the one that will be acceptable to her Wall Street sponsors.Iran has been one of Washington\u0027s chief antagonists for nearly four decades. But a broad deal to keep Tehran from building nuclear weapons has been reached. Alas, any accord will face significant opposition. Some Americans -- including many Republican members of Congress--fear peace more than war.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIt is wrong to say to just \"get over it\" to victim nations. For there to be reconciliation, there must be acknowledgment and justice. Just as we demand that Israel acknowledge and make recompense for its \"original sin,\" we can want no less for the Armenian people.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027In the House and Senate budget proposals for fiscal year 2016, passed with only Republican votes at the end of March, there are big winners and big losers. The big winners are defense spending and contractors and very wealthy people and powerful special interests. The big losers are children, our poorest group in America, and struggling low- and middle-income families.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundHer unconventional announcement video indicates that this time will be different. But with about 18 months to go before the 2016 elections, a loaded field of Republican candidates attacking her, and record amounts of campaign money being spent, this campaign will no doubt be most unconventional. And it is only just getting started!Hofstra Journalism ProfessorBecoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on. Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up.Author, \u0027Hard Choices\u0027; Former U.S. Secretary of StateAfter the spate of white cops/black deaths -- and planted evidence in the Scott case -- should we continue to take police at their word when making life-death decisions? Matalin and Reagan debate the Slager killing and whether this time it\u0027ll be different. Also: We discuss kickoffs of Rand, Hillary, Iran-Nuc.Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Another shooting of an African-American man by a white officer. Another moment to lead seemingly squandered. Isn\u0027t this the moment for the president and his administration to address police brutality and race relations in a big way?Actress and children\u0027s book authorHillary Clinton has always been a divisive figure in American politics. But love her or hate her, she\u0027s now a two-time Presidential candidate. Perhaps the some of her divisiveness comes from the struggle many ambitious women experience: The complex push-and-pull between who she is, who she wants to be and what society expects her to be.Senior Data Scientist, Huffington PostEfforts to reverse those changes -- masquerading as \"religious freedom,\" \"pro-life,\" and \"voter fraud\" laws -- are rampant, but if public opinion polls are any guide, the rising demographic of young and diverse Americans will pose an increasingly powerful counterforce to reactionary politicians.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorHere\u0027s the important point: While EPA considers these questions, the Clean Air Act\u0027s \"best available control technology\" requirements remain fully in effect for carbon pollution, just as for any other dangerous pollutant. That\u0027s another important court victory for the fight against climate change, for EPA and the Clean Air Act, and -- most importantly -- for all of us.Director, NRDC Climate and Clean Air ProgramEach day of this Passover holiday I\u0027ve posted a gourmet way for Jews to honor the commandment to eat matzah, aka \"the bread of affliction\": eight easy recipes that are friendly to modern tastes and diets, and with a little less added affliction. Today is the last day.Creative Director and CEO, Fig Tree \u0026 VineIt\u0027d be naïve for democrats to think that these demographic and geographic advantages won\u0027t boost the young, handsome and telegenic Senator into a pretty good position against their all-but-anointed nominee.Student at Towson University, Intern at United States House of RepresentativesWe need more policymakers and parents pushing for a day when there isn\u0027t a rush to see the school lists of who will be teaching their child because every classroom is led by an excellent teacher.Director of Policy with National Opportunity to Learn (OTL) Campaign, an initiative of the Schott Foundation for Public Education.The truth is that weight loss is a journey that looks a lot like a bumpy ride, and that every woman who successfully loses weight and keeps it off has to overcome challenges that are not often talked about.

What would be nice once in awhile is for the public debate about caregiving to include males. The work men do raising children is every bit as demanding as when women do it.Journalist/ProducerIn the most general sense, spring cleaning is a great time to get organized and donate some old clothes to a good charity, but there might be some other areas of your life that could use a little dusting.

After all, the trash won\u0027t take itself out.Founder, Never Liked It AnywayWhile it may not have been Tammy\u0027s intent, posing this seemingly innocuous question is a poorly disguised microaggression that perpetuates the belief that Asian-Americans are cultural and racial outsider within the American context. TActivist, dancer, journalist, and screenwriterGrowing up in Canada, I always knew that I wanted to explore the world. I researched doing a student exchange in high school, and was always fascinated by National Geographic.
