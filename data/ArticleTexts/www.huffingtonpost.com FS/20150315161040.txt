{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week kicked off with two high profile releases, one more successful than the other. On Monday, 47 Republican senators released an open letter to Iran. The misguided missive purported to help Iran \"fully understand our constitutional system,\" but was widely derided as a meddling and dangerous precedent. Maybe the senators\u0027 next letter will reveal how they plan to pay for another Middle East war, one that could be averted by a successful deal with the Iranians. That same day Apple rolled out the Apple Watch. Fans are already lining up, but do we really need to be even more distracted by endless notifications? Given how Steve Jobs said his best ideas came when he calmed his mind, it\u0027s an interesting question whether he\u0027d have created Apple if he\u0027d been endlessly distracted by having an Apple Watch on his wrist. Oops, I have to run, someone\u0027s texting me!I\u0027m sure most of us can\u0027t imagine being uprooted from our homes and forced to flee with only the clothes on our backs. But that\u0027s what millions of people face each day. As Syria enters its 5th year of conflict, 3.9 million people have fled Syria to neighboring countries.Co-host, MSNBC’s \u0027Morning Joe\u0027I am often asked why I remain a member of the Republican Party. My stock answer has become that it\u0027s the party of Lincoln and Eisenhower and I would like very much to return it to similar hands and am working, however infinitesimally well, to do so. Leaving the party would accomplish nothing in that regard. I also contend that there are still sane and sober people -- in the minority to be sure -- remaining in my party.Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)While the data show that we are making progress in a number of important areas -- including health, education and legal protections -- it equally reveals that these gains have not been fully realized by all.Vice Chair, Clinton FoundationThose who are long-term unemployed are the furthest from the jobs market and are being exposed to low self-esteem and rejection. The stress and anxiety will be too much for some to cope with so it has never been more important to work together to give the younger generation the opportunities they deserve.Singer-songwriterModel and photographerHelene Emsellem is one of our leading experts on how to understand and treat sleep disorders, especially in adolescents. In answer to my questions, she shared her insights on how sleep deprivation affects young people\u0027s health, what she\u0027s learned in decades of clinical experience, and how sleep is related to diagnoses of ADD and ADHD.Forgetting man\u0027s past atrocities or ignoring those happening, now, today, in too many places around the world, is both callous and short-sighted. That is bad enough. But it\u0027s equally hazardous to ignore the astonishing and perilous acts of human courage that negate, undo, reverse the violence and uphold our rights and dignity as humans.Author; Nobel Peace Prize laureatePhilanthropist; Businessman; Co-founder, 100 LivesA benign appearance -- well-dressed types testifying before Congress, pontificating in print and on TV, or even filling key positions in the executive branch -- belies a malign impact. Do we really need that chatter? Does it enhance the quality of U.S. policy? If policy/defense/action intellectuals fell silent would America be less secure?Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027We take the issue of campus sexual assault very seriously (unlike some others). In the coming weeks and months of this campaign, we hope that The Hunting Ground inspires serious debate and serious discussion from journalists and policy-makers alike. We owe that much to students.Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"What a terrible irony that in this year of celebration of the Selma marches we are witnessing the resurgence of overt law enforcement brutality and injustice in Ferguson, Cleveland, New York City, and elsewhere, reminding us how far we still have to go.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThere were young men dying and health care workers in \"hazmat\" suiting covered head to toe. People were unwilling to touch, comfort or hold many of these dying, frightened men. It was the many members of the lesbian community and straight female allies that came to our aid.Four-time Olympic gold medalist, gay man living with HIV, and activistI was a member of this chapter 14 years ago. The second Black man to be initiated in those halls. I thought we were different. Maybe I was just being hopeful. I believed in S-A-E. I believed in the True Gentlemen. I believed my brothers were my brothers. I believed my son should be their brother if he so chose one day. But then I saw that video.Associate, Gungoll Jackson, Box and Devoll, PCWhile there are more problems than ever, there are also more solutions. Technology now allows for worldwide collaboration and revolutionary impact with almost no barriers. So get busy. Find a problem that matters to you and become the change agent you were meant to be.Author, Speaker, EntrepreneurODS (Obama Derangement Syndrome) won\u0027t work out any better for Republicans in 2016 than ABB (Anyone But Bush) did for Democrats in 2004. Voters still expect you to stand for something not just against whatever the president of the opposing party is doing.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusI recently came across several profiles in The Huffington Post\u0027s series \"All Work, No Pay: The False Promise of the American Economy.\" I strongly disagree that the promise of America is false, but the moving profiles of Americans struggling to make it in today\u0027s economy do tell an important story. I am writing to explain how I believe conservative reforms will create opportunity for all.U.S. senator from FloridaA situation like this calls for a real apology, but these young men have failed to deliver it. Instead of acknowledging their own racism, they denied it or sidestepped it. Instead of reckoning honestly with the harm they have done to others, they framed their family and friends as the real victims.Lecturer in the Yale English department and Faculty Fellow at the University Church in YaleSolving problems is the innovator\u0027s path to transformative ideas. Boston\u0027s problem-solving power is not limited to one person, one building or one neighborhood. It is woven throughout the fabric of the City of Boston.54th Mayor of BostonA few years ago I took a very big leap and decided to go to Europe on my own. Since childhood I\u0027d traveled all over the world with family and friends, but I\u0027d never gone on a trip by myself. The very idea terrified me. But surprisingly, one of the things that made the experience so enjoyable was traveling by myself.AuthorEither we lessen the dominance of big American corporations over American politics or we increase their allegiance and responsibility to America. It has to be one or the other. Americans can\u0027t thrive within a political system run largely by big American corporations -- organized to boost their share prices but not boost America.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027There is no way to stop the barrage of insulting, deceptive attacks that will be leveled at Clinton, or any candidate, for that matter, but the least we can do is refuse to be influenced by people who distort the facts, resort to fiction and refuse to do the level of research that separates journalists with integrity from imposters.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027People are baffled that my exterior -- a 27-year-old who used to work at Clinique and peruses Pinterest for fashion inspiration -- could reflect an interior longing for consecrated life and its seemingly antiquated vows of celibacy, poverty and obedience. Their questions have forced me to confront my self-image.College student discerning religious life, ambassador of National Catholic Sisters Week, Illinois nativeThere\u0027s a difference between having your feelings hurt and being systemically denied access to the things you need to succeed in life. You can ask someone five easy questions.Seattle-based writerIt may be that we\u0027re all more abrasive than we used to be. A 2014 poll by Weber Shandwick and Powell Tate in partnership with KRC Research found that most people think America has a raging civility problem.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIt turns out there\u0027s more than one way to make an attractive body, and those different body types evolve to be well-integrated. That\u0027s a liberating message for most of us: evolutionary biology has more to offer our understanding of diversity than the idea that only one \"most attractive\" body (or face, or personality) always wins out.Evolutionary biologist and authorFor years employers have offered worksite wellness programs, ranging from newsletters or gym memberships to high stakes incentive programs that change your insurance premiums by thousands of dollars if you lose weight, reduce your blood pressure or blood sugar levels, quit smoking or achieve some other health outcome.Professor, McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown UniversityFrank G. Millard Professor of Law, University of MichiganWith each passing day since these shows were announced, it has become clearer that the \"Fare Thee Well\" concept, ostensibly conceived to pay tribute to a beloved band on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, bears little resemblance to the Grateful Dead.Founder/publisher of Boulder Weekly, an award-winning alternative weekly in its 22nd year of publication.Facebook is a SOCIAL network. Social means interactive. Everything you post on Facebook can evoke a response from friends. And if, after sharing something, you don\u0027t think your post is funny, or smart, or relevant, or interesting -- you can delete it. Here\u0027s what not to post on Facebook.Blogger, Empty House Full Mind, Founder, Midlifeboulevard.comThe ongoing trade deficit has transferred trillions of dollars out of our economy. It has cost us millions of jobs, tens of thousands of factories and entire industries. As it continues, it is costing us our ability to make a living as a country -- except for our financial sector. This has made a very few people unimaginably wealthy, but it has made the rest of us, and the country, poorer.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureFeeling all warm and gooey because your spouse had a great time banging someone else is not something we\u0027re socialized to feel. We can be thrilled for our partner if they get a raise or promotion, but why can\u0027t we be happy for our partners who find joy in bed with someone else?Author, Actress and DirectorYes, we crossed the bridge half a century ago, and we crossed it again in a reenactment with the president this weekend, but 50 years from now at the 100th anniversary, we will be judged not by whether we brought a Black president to the bridge.President, National Action NetworkHere\u0027s a set of wedding vows with practical merit. They might sound unconventional and unromantic. They\u0027re certainly not poetic, but these promises, if kept, will go far in sealing a marriage for the ages.AuthorGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"DOWN TO THE WIRE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
