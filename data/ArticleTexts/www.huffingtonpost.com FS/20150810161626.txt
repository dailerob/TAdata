{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Disruptive protest isn\u0027t nice -- that\u0027s the whole point. But sometimes it\u0027s necessary. My guess is that Bernie Sanders and Black Lives Matter will get the choreography right before too long. Black Lives Matter will continue actions that occasionally disrupt campaign events of Sanders and others Democrats. But compared to the disruptive effect of Donald Trump on the Republican field, BLM is a picnic for Democrats. Trump is a caricature of things that more mannered Republicans have been getting away with for years. He smokes out what the Republicans really stand for. No wonder they are worried. Trump isn\u0027t nice. Neither is Black Lives Matter. But the Democrats should be grateful for the form of creative disruption being visited upon them.So far forest partnerships are not featuring prominently in climate discussions heading into Paris. The talks are focusing on what each country can do by itself, instead of also looking at what more we can do by working together. This is a miscalculation.CEO, UnileverUnless and until white Americans recognize that the very forces that plunder and kill black bodies are a product of forces that sustain white privilege in a way that will ultimately destroy the planet itself, racism will be kept at a distance -- a \"problem\" to be solved. And it never will be.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryThe SEC\u0027s disclosure rule isn\u0027t perfect. Some corporations could try to game it by contracting out their low-wage jobs. Some industries pay their typical workers higher wages than other industries. But the rule marks an important start.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Recent bilateral discussions involving Americans, Russians, Saudis, and others that there may be a renewed push for negotiations to end the conflict in Syria. It should have been clear from the beginning that a negotiated solution is the only way to end this long war.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Studies show the number of illegal firings of union activists increasing and the number of union members in the United States dwindling. Workers need legislation to stop it.International President, United SteelworkersI know Rosie O\u0027Donnell. Rosie is a friend of mine. And you, Donald Trump, are no Rosie O\u0027Donnell.President, Elizabeth Birch Company/Global OutNo, not to the nomination, much less the White House. What Sanders has done is to establish himself as a force in the Democratic Party\u0027s selection process. He has done so by demonstrating qualities that have largely disappeared from America\u0027s political life over the past few decades.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe young people who began the Black Lives Matter Movement are not in forgiveness mode. Their rage has exploded on the streets because their pain imploded within them. They are tired of being afraid, tired of being targeted, and tired of being ignored. So, what happens now, a year after Michael Brown was gunned down?Writer, author, musician, pastor, preacher and social justice advocate.From these experiences, today\u0027s leaders learned what not to do, as they witnessed many of their predecessors trap themselves chasing money, fame, and power - losing sight of their True North. They learned the perils of putting self-interest ahead of the institutions they led.Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolSarah Palin uses her Facebook page to comment on all things political, including touting Donald Trump\u0027s candidacy for the presidency. But when it comes to Trump\u0027s outrageously sexist comments about Megyn Kelly, Palin has remained shamefully silent about El Donaldo\u0027s latest round of misogyny.Author and filmmakerIt is a beautiful thing to have a feeling, a notion and then transform it into something tangible. It\u0027s like being in the X-Men.Author, An Untamed State and AyitiAfter six years of waiting, the United States and Egypt have rekindled formal strategic dialogue. Secretary of State John Kerry\u0027s visit to Cairo symbolizes a rapprochement between the U.S. and one of the key players in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.Gabr Fellow; Ph.D. Student in Secular Studies and Religion, Claremont Graduate UniversityEgyptian Middle East politics researcher, writer and media commentatorDemocrats can raise environmental issues throughout their campaign, but it is unlikely that their environmental views will differentiate them from their primary opponents who are also likely to be pro-environment.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteImagine how many more people a doctor would have to hire just to deal with a boatload of new insurers. Or to deal with a bunch of politicians who don\u0027t know what they\u0027re talking about.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgOne way to address housing discrimination is by giving low-income families, who are disproportionately low-income, more opportunities to live in communities with greater resources. The Section 8 program is an important tool in that effort, but we need to do more than hand out vouchers to the fortunate few families.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeLowey and Alter debate first GOP debates. Some consensus that Fiorina and Cruz rising, Rubio nominee potential, Bush and Walker meh... as Trump damages GOP as the fringe without the euphemisms. Then: after years of taking incoming as a Kenyan/Hitler, is Obama\u0027s tone insulting Republicans on Iran Deal?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Meaningful reform will require sustained effort to create the cultural shift in policing that is necessary to restore trust and legitimacy, especially among racial minorities. A year after Michael Brown\u0027s death, we have made strides toward progress, but there is more work to do.Professor of Law at Wake Forest University School of LawAs billionaire Donald Trump continues his barrage of sharp attacks on Fox News, other Republican candidates have improved their chances to gain their party\u0027s presidential nomination. Yet, as each of the 17 announced candidates jockeys for position, Trump is still the center of attention.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorFrank makes no mention that he talked to any entity that might have given him Planned Parenthood\u0027s perspective -- and he writes as if he may not have even reviewed the unedited version of the Center for Medical Progress\u0027 video.Former media critic at the Rocky Mountain News; Blogger, www.bigmedia.org.Chuck Schumer tells his Democratic listeners that he does not want a war with Iran; but this is a hollow pretense. The preponderance of influential persons who side with him, as they did on Iraq in 2003, do indeed want a war. Even if he were in earnest, what could the peaceable Senator Chuck Schumer do?Professor of Literature, Yale UniversitySome juvenile detention centers may double as holding places for abused children, but they remain juvenile detention centers nonetheless. I am all too familiar with this phenomenon because, like the Tsimhoni children, my sister and I were incarcerated in a juvenile detention center for refusing to see our father at the age of 14.Activist and writerSir, you revealed in the Megyn Kelly exchange, and other exchanges on Thursday night, a level of unrepentant meanness that is unacceptable on a debate stage watched by millions of young, hopeful Americans.Forbes Education Columnist; Author, \u0027How to Talk American\u0027; Director, \u0027Crotty\u0027s Kids\u0027; Co-founder, \u0027Monk Magazine\u0027Keep it light and respectful.

Latinos not only happen to live in the areas of the U.S. most affected by these events, but many of them are also less able to economically withstand the impacts.Working to empower the Latino community nationwide.While I, too, mourn the killing of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe, it revives in me an uncomfortable memory. Some 50 years ago, I went on my first (and only) wild-game hunt -- the most stupid thing I\u0027ve ever done.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” published by HCI, December 2014What will happen when I go through menopause? Will my vaginal tissue thin to the point where I can no longer tolerate intercourse Do these changes happen to every post-menopausal woman, or just some? I set out to get answers.Blogger, A Sexy Woman of A Certain AgeRobin Williams was a kind man, noted for his good deeds and the joy he brought to so many of our lives. I think he would want us to grow from this loss, to take what we\u0027ve learned, and to share it with our village.Photographer, writer, suicide awareness advocateWe all know coconut oil can yield shiny locks and radiant skin. But did you know it also fights rust and keeps eggs fresh for a whole entire year?The women\u0027s lifestyle destinationWhile I can\u0027t guarantee that your road will be without bumps, in fact, I can almost assure you that there will be bumps, I can offer you some insights that helped me along the way.
