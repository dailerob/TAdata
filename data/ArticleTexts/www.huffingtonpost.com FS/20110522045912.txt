{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"If you are reading this Sunday Roundup, it means that those Rapture-ready believers predicting that Saturday would be Judgment Day were wrong. But earlier this week, a different kind of judgment day did arrive, in the form of the first comprehensive report on last year\u0027s Upper Big Branch mine disaster, which killed 29 workers. And a damning judgment it was, placing blame squarely on the mine\u0027s owner, and calling the tragedy \"a cautionary tale of hubris.\" The same verdict could be applied to Dominique Strauss-Kahn who, on course to become president of France, felt entitled to take a detour to a hotel sexual assault.

I\u0027d rather fight tooth and nail to keep and restore what I have than take a break from it. But that is so much easier said than done with a Klonopin in my pocket.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 05.20.2011Editor, Eat the PressAs everyone knows, this was the week that the federal government hit its deficit ceiling. That was the story everyone thought would dominate the week. Yet, somehow, Newt Gingrich surprised everyone by managing to hit his own first.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 05.18.2011Despite commencement speeches they\u0027ll hear, for many of the graduates spilling into the job market throughout the nation, there isn\u0027t going to be much to commence. Economically at least, this is an especially rough time to be graduating from college.Read Post | CommentsDylan Ratigan, 05.18.2011Host of MSNBC\u0027s “The Dylan Ratigan Show”For over a decade, we\u0027ve been running our politics on fear so often that it\u0027s hardly noticeable. The debt ceiling kabuki is a prime example: we\u0027ll face catastrophic economic consequences if we don\u0027t raise the ceiling, and the end of America if we don\u0027t cut entitlements.Read Post | CommentsBarbara Hannah Grufferman, 05.15.2011Writer, speaker, lifestyle expert and author, \u0027The Best of Everything After 50,\u0027Conventional wisdom might say that women over 50 are most concerned about how they look, how many wrinkles they have and how young they appear. But when I asked them to share their worst fear, none of these issues came up.Read Post | CommentsSen. Jon Tester, 05.19.2011U.S. Senator from MontanaBefore politicians try to cut spending by breaking the promises made to our seniors, we ought to be looking at ways to cut the number of unnecessary Cold War-era installations overseas while keeping our armed forces the strongest in the world.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 05.15.2011Co-founder and co-editor of The American ProspectThe apparent self-destruction of Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a New York hotel is emblematic of a European left that has ceased to be much of a progressive alternative.Read Post | CommentsPaul Brandeis Raushenbush, 05.20.2011Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe more I think about the people who are placing their hope in the current end-of-the-world scheme, the less I want to laugh at them and the more I feel compassion.Read Post | CommentsJill Sobule, 05.20.2011Singer/SongwriterI have always been fascinated by the end-time believers. I envy their strong faith and certainty, as well as their flexibility when the believed date of doom passes without even a small locust infestation.Read Post | CommentsMichael B.

What is our business is how we discuss this with our own children and, I hope, how we can leave the children of these public and private people alone.Read Post | CommentsSen. Ron Wyden, 05.19.2011U.S. Senator from OregonThe American people should not be held hostage to the false claims that without the billions in taxpayer subsidies oil companies currently receive, they will produce less oil and that will raise the price at the pump.Read Post | CommentsDan Collins, 05.16.2011New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostDonald Trump is out, but the memory of the Trump-for-President era will, I hope, live on. We\u0027ve learned a lot. The public, for instance, has been educated to understand that you can\u0027t trust a thing the guy says.Read Post | CommentsRhea Perlman, 05.17.2011Actress and advocate for childrenThis week I got to hang out at the airport to see off a bunch of hugely excited kids leaving on a trip to London.

This objective is attainable for most everyone.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 05.17.2011Rabbi and writerThe biggest mistake we make in determining why powerful men cheat is to believe they\u0027re looking for sex. If it\u0027s sex they\u0027re after they have wives who can cater to their needs. No, these men are looking for something else entirely: validation.Read Post | CommentsKlaus Schwab, 05.20.2011Founder and Executive Chairman, World Economic ForumThe state of the world is fraught with unprecendented imbalances and tremendous risks, and institutions are struggling to keep up with the changing times.
