{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThe first women\u0027s revolution was led by the suffragists over a hundred years ago, when brave women like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton fought, among other things, to give women the right to vote. The second women\u0027s revolution was powerfully led by two Smith College alumnae, Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. They fought -- and Gloria continues to fight -- to expand the role of women in our society, to give us full access to the rooms of power where decisions are made. Yesterday, I gave the commencement address to Smith College\u0027s class of 2013, urging them to lead the third women\u0027s revolution by redefining success, so that all of us -- women and men -- can live our lives with more grace, more joy, more empathy, more gratitude, and yes, more love.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The student loan program calls attention to the double standards of debt relief. Corporations are able to declare bankruptcy under Chapter 11 and write off old loan -- but college debt follows former students literally to the grave even if they go bankrupt.Comments (775)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Google, Amazon, Starbucks, every other major corporation, and every big Wall Street bank, are sheltering as much of their U.S. profits abroad as they can, while telling Washington that lower corporate taxes are necessary in order to keep the U.S. \"competitive.\"Comments (200)Richard C. LevinPresident of Yale UniversityWe leave together. You leave Yale College after four years; I leave the Yale Presidency after twenty. I find myself thinking about a Grateful Dead song written in 1970, the year I came to Yale as a graduate student. You know the words: \"Lately it occurs to me, what a long, strange trip it\u0027s been.\" It\u0027s been a long trip, but, for us, more wonderful than strange.Comments (50)Suzanne PerrymanBlogger at SpecialNeedsMom.comAdults are really good at understanding the thoughts of others. Children -- not so much. Rebecca Saxe tells us the part of the brain responsible for thinking about others\u0027 minds reaches maximum growth during adulthood.CommentsDesmond Tutu, Sohaila Abdulali and Jacob LiefYes, governments must step up. But so should we all. Why shouldn\u0027t rape be dinner table conversation? We talk about war, we talk about death, we discuss values with our children. But on the subject of sexual assault, we remain silent and squeamish.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWe sometimes forget that getting laws passed and getting court rulings declared is, comparatively, the easy part. The hate is still out there, however, and the haters are getting more desperate. Our worst enemies right now are complacency and the seductive message that we\u0027ve \"arrived.\"Comments (503)Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027The despairing of May 2003 were convinced of one true thing, that we had not stopped the invasion of Iraq, but they extrapolated from that a series of false assumptions about our failures and our powerlessness across time and space.Comments (12)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupThough this week\u0027s Game Of Thrones certainly served up plenty of doom and gloom, it also gave the optimists among us new reason to hope, as Tyrion, Sam and even Ser Davos notched some unlikely victories over the generally ascendant forces of destruction.Comments (223)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorFor all the numbers bouncing around the immigration reform debate, the most relevant number is 27 percent. That\u0027s the share of Gov Romney\u0027s Latino vote and that\u0027s the reason this much needed advance in public policy might just make it over the legislative goal line.CommentsMichael F. JacobsonExecutive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestThe Times not only fanned unfounded fears that cutting sodium is risky, but it failed to inform readers that vanishingly few Americans consume the very-low-sodium levels that the IOM considered.CommentsLinda BergtholdHealth policy researcherWhy do people think Obamacare no longer exists? It is already being implemented and it will continue to be implemented in January 2014.CommentsRoy S. GuttermanDirector, Tully Center for Free Speech, Newhouse School, Syracuse UniversityEven as a staunch free press advocate, I admit that the government has an obligation to protect certain state secrets. But once information reaches the press and the public, the resulting investigative witch hunts raise questions about how free our press really is.CommentsChrissie HyndeLead singer of the PretendersForce-feeding causes the birds\u0027 livers to balloon to up to 10 times their normal size and become diseased with what is known as hepatic steatosis. In addition to being miserably ill with a painful and debilitating disease, the geese can barely breathe because their grotesquely enlarged livers displace their lungs and other internal organs.Comments (36)Susan MercandettiVice President, ABC NewsAs a \"Nightline\" producer, I traveled all over the world covering interesting stories, leaving unused theater tickets and broken dates behind. There was always tomorrow.CommentsRobert F. Kennedy Jr.President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Senior Attorney, NRDCThose who bother to read these historical snippets will find many important departures and only tenuous parallels between the Obama Administration\u0027s IRS affair and Richard Nixon\u0027s Watergate-era IRS scandal.Comments (282)Leah S. GoodmanEighth-grader at John F. Kennedy International School in BerlinTumblr is so much more than a website at this point. It has grown into such a huge community, one that could be easily destroyed by the sort of reckless marketing that Yahoo must be about to unleash.Comments (26)Jim Yong Kim and Ban Ki-moonAfrica\u0027s Great Lakes region can silence the guns, boost trust and trade between neighbors, educate millions of out-of-school children, empower women, and create economic opportunities that will help the countries forge a path to prosperity, good governance, and lasting stability.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorA bipartisan legislative movement toward legalizing the growing of industrial hemp is finally on the rise.Comments (38)Creed BrattonActor, \u0027The Office\u0027Well, that\u0027s that. Tears have been shed. Stories have been finalized and Creed ends up right where he belongs... jail. Sometimes the days were long, sometimes the coffee was odd, but the company was always... hmm, well, odd also.Comments (26)Josh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceThe NRA didn\u0027t just throw down the gauntlet to our government in Houston. It also articulated a vision of America and its ideals that is the antithesis of what our Founders intended, and which would mean the absolution of our Constitution.Comments (666)Andrew JenksAward-winning filmmakerI was a 25-year-old documentary filmmaker from New York working on a show for MTV. He was a 21-year-old dancer in East Oakland trying to move on with his life after the murder of his little brother. I spent a year embedded in his life, and got a front row seat to an American epidemic.CommentsAnnette InsdorfDirector of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University, and author of PHILIP KAUFMANThe first few days of the Cannes Film Festival have been marked by surprises -- whether in the shifting national identity of movies, or peace-making efforts between towering directors -- and parties that defy the rain.CommentsFernando Henrique Cardoso, Cesar Gaviria, Ricardo Lagos and Ernesto ZedilloAfter more than four decades of a failed war on drugs, calls for a change in strategy are growing louder by the day. In Latin America, the debate is positively deafening.Comments (17)Don TapscottAdvisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027We\u0027re in the early stages of a massive transformation. Just like the printing press moved the world from a feudal, agrarian society to industrial capitalism, the Internet ushers in a new era.Comments (11)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile men seem to welcome the existence of dual income households, and marriages marked by (mostly) shared responsibilities, there\u0027s a hitch: The guys still want to be the primary breadwinner. That is, she can bring home the bacon, so long as it\u0027s not all of it.Comments (579)Abbie RumbachBlogger, \"The Kids Made Me Fat\"Every now and then, the girls have actual conversations while we\u0027re cruising down the road, my favorite among them being \"What are you going to be when you grow up?\"CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersHundreds of homeowners who have been playing by the rules while the big banks have cheated them are risking arrest at the Department of Justice to make an unmistakable statement: it is about time for the government to side with poor and middle class folks.CommentsDr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistDr. Vatsal Thakkar, who is also a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center, makes a powerful argument for the need to consider sleep problems as a possible cause when evaluating patients for ADHD.Comments (21)Christine GeiserHalf The Sky Movement community ambassadorOne of the countless benefits I have received from yoga is feeling empowered to raise awareness about and money for communities that are suffering around the world.CommentsHal TaussigAuthor, \u0027A New New Testament: A Bible for the 21st Century Combining Traditional and Newly Discovered Texts\u0027More than 75 otherwise unknown documents from the early Christ movements of the first and second centuries have been discovered in the past 150 years. As they have been translated and studied, it\u0027s become clear that many of them belong to the very heart of Christian beginnings.Comments (417)Joy Huber, 2013.20.05Steve Mariotti, 2013.20.05Chris Weigant, 2013.20.05Saladin Ambar, 2013.20.05Jenn Horton, 2013.20.05David Bank, 2013.20.05Pam Murtaugh, 2013.20.05Rabbi Abraham Cooper, 2013.20.05Jared Bernstein, 2013.20.05Dan Roitman, 2013.20.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"TORNADO HELL: OKLA.
