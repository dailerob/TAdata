{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Today I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of Impact X, our newest section in the HuffPost Impact family, which will highlight the change-making power when humanity and technology come together. When they come together in a focused way, we see their impact multiplied -- hence the X -- and Impact X is a platform for innovators, thinkers, activists, and anyone who wants to use technology to solve problems both in their neighborhoods and across the world. And like all our Impact sections, it\u0027s a place to discover worthy causes, read truly inspiring stories, and find ways to take action. So please stop by, share your stories, connect, and get involved. Because global movements take off when people see that they can become the change they wish to see in the world.Read Post | Comments (71)Howard Fineman, 09/26/12Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe debate season will be Romney\u0027s last chance to overtake Obama in what, so far, has been an uninformative and tactical contest of accusation, innuendo, non-ideas, non-specifics and invisible agendas.Read Post | Comments (196)Mike Duke, 09.26.2012President and CEO, WalmartAt the Clinton Global Initiative\u0027s annual meeting on Sunday, President Clinton asked me a provocative question: \"If the new president of Libya asked you to open a store in Tripoli, would you consider it?\"Read Post | Comments (18)Marlo Thomas, 09/26/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistThis year marks the 20th anniversary of Johnny Carson\u0027s departure from The Tonight Show, and many of today\u0027s top comedic stars were lucky enough to have launched their careers from the Carson springboard.Read Post | Comments (17)Naomi Wolf, 09/26/12Bestselling author, \u0027The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot\u0027What do I take home from my week in the UK, talking about something as simple and valuable as the new science of female arousal and orgasm? It seems that female sexuality is still such a difficult and contested issue even to think about in mainstream media spaces.Read Post | Comments (30)Robert Reich, 09/26/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027What we\u0027re seeing in Ohio isn\u0027t a new Mitt Romney. It\u0027s a newly-packaged Mitt Romney. The real Mitt Romney is the one we saw on the videotape last week. And no amount of re-taping can disguise the package\u0027s true contents.Read Post | Comments (68)Michael Sigman, 09/26/12Writer/Editor; Music PublisherThrough his recordings, his personal appearances and his hit TV shows, Andy gave old-fashioned songwriters a chance to stay in the game during a time when rock \u0026 rollers came to dominate the charts by recording their own material. In particular, Andy gave my dad, Carl Sigman, the last and biggest hit of his career.Read Post | Comments (11)Michael B. Keegan, 09/26/12President, People For the American WayGeorge Stephanopoulos, host of ABC\u0027s This Week, appears to have forgotten the difference between provocative discussion and straight-up trolling.Read Post | Comments (215)Evelyn Leopold, 09/26/12Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsThe presidents of Brazil and Argentina, both women, woke up any drowsy General Assembly delegate, passionately arguing their country\u0027s policy from economics to Syria to Cuba to Iran. But President Obama grabbed the attention, not because he broke new ground but because he is... well... Obama.Read Post | Comments (57)Christina Pesoli, 09/26/12Writer, Founder \"Emotional Hard Body Divorce Boot Camp\"There is one group of assets that is entirely left out of the formal divorce process: your friends. Because friends are a primary source of comfort and support, and further because there\u0027s nothing like a divorce to make you need heaping helpings of both, how this very valuable group of assets gets divvied up can have a big impact on how easily you bounce back.Read Post | Comments (56)Robert Weiss, 09/26/12Founding Director of The Sexual Recovery InstituteSadly, many men don\u0027t realize the profound effects infidelity can have on the emotional life of a trusting long-term partner. Inevitably, most cheaters are eventually found out, and the resulting fallout is often much greater than anticipated by the cheater.Read Post | Comments (55)Austin Dacey, 09/26/12Author, \u0027The Future of Blasphemy: Speaking of the Sacred in an Age of Human Rights\u0027Those who study the history of blasphemy laws are condemned to repeat themselves: These laws don\u0027t work.

Confused? It gets even crazier.Read Post | Comments (12)Amy MacPherson, 09/26/12Social and Rights AdvocateYou know them as MasoniChip, or perhaps you\u0027ve been led to believe it was a state and provincial endeavor intended to protect your little ones.

They both agreed early on that the race would be about issues.

Talbott, 09/26/12Author, \"Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\"If I were a Republican campaign strategist with lots of cash from wealthy, corporate and banking donors, I would wait until the last two weeks of the election cycle and then flood the airwaves with television commercials that tried to scare Americans on what a second Obama term might look like.Read Post | Comments (161)David Halperin, 09/26/12Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgThe Chronicle is allowing its advertiser to determine the composition of an event that the Chronicle is presenting as a program of its own. It\u0027s renting out its reputation.
