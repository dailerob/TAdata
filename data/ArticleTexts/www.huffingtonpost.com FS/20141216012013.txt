{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In principle, Saturday\u0027s vote to keep the government open should be the perfect curtain-raiser for the political debates between now and the 2016 election. As their price for averting a government shutdown, Republicans demanded and got a gutting of one of the most important provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, preventing banks from speculating with government insured money. Agencies hated by Republicans such as the Environmental Protection Agency took big cuts, and a rider was inserted permitting \"mountaintop removal\" coal mining once again. Another extraneous provision demanded by conservatives permits massive increase in individual campaign contributions. Far worse will be directed at ordinary working families when the new Congress meets in January.While untrained domestic lone wolves have been inspired to undertake violent attacks, unlike their more sophisticated foreign counterparts, they often die or are captured shortly after initiating violent confrontations, with more limited casualties. Still, even untrained loners can kill dozens if a nexus of factors align.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityBe shocked, be disgusted, be appalled, but don\u0027t be fooled.

I had 1,000 followers and I was the farthest thing from a role model and the person I consider myself to be today. From the bottom of my heart, I am truly sorry to each and every person I have ever offended.Vine starCable lobbyists will continue to spread lies about Net Neutrality as long as members of the media and Congress are willing to repeat them. It\u0027s the FCC\u0027s job to see through the propaganda, do right by Internet users and protect Net Neutrality once and for all.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressToday, more than ever, I am extremely proud to be Australian. At a time of deep crisis, the people of Sydney have shown me that equality, tolerance and non-violence are not just hipster rhetoric. We stand together as people supporting other people in the most human of ways, and we say #IllRideWithYou.Founder of online family travel magazine www.suitcasesandstrollers.com which provides tips and inspiration to parents with kids under 12.Elizabeth Warren represents a new politics in which, by challenging the power of the oligarchy, she has the potential of reclaiming the white working class for Democrats and uniting them with the coalition of professionals, single women, gays and minorities who elected Obama.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistWhen people discuss school shootings, what immediately comes to mind are those like Sandy Hook that shatter entire communities within minutes, even seconds. And yes, mass shootings take a devastating toll, but they are not the only senseless acts of gun violence that threaten our schools.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaIt is widely understood that the more GOP candidates for president adopt the priorities of the base of their party -- particularly hard-core opposition to immigration reform -- the more difficult it is for them to win general elections.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersWhen politicians start advancing laws that will actually help women -- not just co-opting the language -- then we can all celebrate and declare a real victory.Director of the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project.Bad news for Pearson Education made be good news for the rest of us. The testing and publishing mega-giant is on the run, but it looks like it will not be able to hide.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownA few hours ago I read about remarks made by a prominent individual on a much-celebrated TV show Sunday morning and I have been haunted by them ever since. The remarks concerned the torture report recently released to the American people by a committee of the United States Senate.Founder, People for the American WayIt hurts. It just hurts. You suppress your feelings as much as you can because you fear if you really let it out, you would never recover. And here\u0027s the thing -- you didn\u0027t have to be that mom. For all the moms and dads reading this now -- this doesn\u0027t have to be you.Communications Director, Sandy Hook PromiseWhether the Green Mountain State keeps moving forward with its goal of achieving universal coverage while also reducing the growth of health care spending depends largely on how the state\u0027s residents and businesses react to what Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin has in mind.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgNot only do we rank 26th in median wealth, we also are the most anti-employee country in the developed world.

I\u0027m just saying that you\u0027re going to have a hard time convincing Jesus that it\u0027s a Christianity he would recognize.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistSince anyone with a concealed-carry permit is, by definition, one of the good guys, the gun industry and its supporters work overtime trying to get concealed-carry accepted as the law of the land.Mike the Gun GuyCavafy\u0027s diasporic experience contributed to the formation of his overall cultural politics, which continues to inspire an exceptionally large number of readers, poets, scholars, intellectuals, and activists throughout the world.George Seferis Professor of Modern Greek Studies and Professor of Comparative Literature, Harvard UniversityThe \"CRomnibus\" spectacle was a return to the showdown days of past years, with another phony \"drama\" ginned up around a \"must-pass\" bill in order to serve up a \"compromise\" -- a \"bipartisan\" one, of course -- that serves the interests of corporations and wealthy individuals. But hold the cynicism, because all is not yet lost.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourRather than choosing either of these destructive options, we are fortunate to be able to choose safe, affordable cleaner energy and more efficient energy products, such as vehicles and furnaces, instead. That is the future and it is not a distant future -- it\u0027s happening right now.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorBy embracing the absurd and truly embodying it, Colbert has made politics and public policy uproariously funny, while providing much-needed bouts of sanity for devoted news junkies.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaTo say that Black lives matter is not to say that other lives do not; indeed, it is quite the reverse -- it is to recognize that all lives do matter, and to acknowledge that African Americans are often targeted unfairly and that our society is not yet so advanced as to have become truly color blind.Minister, BuxMont Unitarian Universalist FellowshipHuman beings do terrible things to one another, yet are capable of acts of kindness, sacrifice and love. One wishes for clearer sailing in the coming year, especially for the use of smarter power (hard and soft more in sync) by President Obama.Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorDon\u0027t follow the crowds.
