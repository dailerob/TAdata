{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectToday marks the passing of Maya Angelou, whose passionate and timeless voice for empathy, passion and humanity touched millions. Throughout her life, Dr. Angelou eloquently presented a powerful and unique expression of what we can become and what we must leave behind. I had the pleasure and honor of calling Dr. Angelou a longtime friend. While our paths crossed many times, our trip to Nelson Mandela\u0027s inauguration in 1994 was especially important to me. The event marked a transition for South Africa that had been proven possible in the United States just decades before, in part due to Dr. Angelou\u0027s powerful words. As Madiba spoke, he recited Dr. Angelou\u0027s poem, \"Still I Rise.\" These indelible words define a woman of extraordinary power and courage.It\u0027ll be Brain-Damage-Gate and Benghazi-Gate. If they\u0027re not flogging either of those topics, it\u0027ll be a journey through the space-time continuum to the jolly old \u002790s, with all of the Bill Clinton-era conspiracy theories re-emerging like a zombie apocalypse.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowAnd no, that\u0027s not a trick question.Blair ChristieSenior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, CiscoIt took one long weekend and several blog posts, but the world\u0027s top economic minds have determined that yes, in fact, inequality is still a problem.Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostHers was a life born of nothingness, of vicious sexual assault, of shattered boulevards and smashed glass windows. But from the muck of that life, Maya Angelou became a voice for girls, for women, and even for boys like me.Kevin PowellPublic speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027Scientists must become part of the political process and run for office. At a time when science bears on many of the world\u0027s problems, we have a Congress full of lawyers who are trained not to get at the truth but to defeat their opponent at any cost--including the truth.Victor StengerPhysicist, PhD, bestselling authorUnlike Nora Ephron, Maya Angelou and I have nothing in common. When I read I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, it did not offer me identification as Heartburn had, it offered me access -- vivid, scary, and profound access -- to a place I had never been before.Claudia ZelevanskyWriter, director, educator \u0026 arts consultantSomething is fundamentally broken, and we need radical changes in order to fix it. We need to put the fear of prison time into the heads of top executives before they make the decision to put profits over people.Ian ReifowitzAuthor of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Your goal should be to work in a job where you sometimes leave on time but you also often stay a little longer -- not because you have to, but because you want to.Dharmesh ShahCo-founder and CTO of HubSpotSomething revolutionary happened last week and you probably didn\u0027t hear about it. Tesco, a multinational grocery retailer-the second largest in the world, made a moral decision to protect its customers that guaranteed it would lose money.Laurie DavidAuthor, Producer, AdvocateFrance is in danger. In Sunday\u0027s elections for the European Parliament, a quarter of France\u0027s citizens voted for the worst, choosing the party that was not only anti-Europe but also anti-France.Bernard-Henri LévyBernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Even if you\u0027re not yet an entrepreneur, you can be entrepreneurial in everything you do. If you view each stop as an opportunity to learn something, there is always something you will take away from that experience.Tory BurchCEO and designer, Tory BurchIn recent years there has been a regular drum beat of news stories warning us about the enormous unfunded liabilities of state and local pension funds.Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We found that interrogators who were told that their sessions would be taped were less likely to use certain high-pressure interrogation techniques such as threatening the suspect and promising leniency in exchange for a confession.Jeff KukuckaAssistant Professor of Psychology, Towson UniversityEven as some countries continue steadily along the path toward greater democracy, others have taken some concerning steps back with respect to political rights and civil liberties. Your challenge is to ensure that democracy expands, deepens, and delivers.Ambassador Samantha PowerU.S. Ambassador to the United NationsAs the father of a daughter, I wish that all men would take just a moment, today, to look inside, to decide if they are proud of the way they look at women on the street, the way they talk to them in bars, the way they talk about them when they feel the women are just out of earshot.Brian KoppelmanWriter. Director. Host of Grantland Podcast The MomentAnother Stanley Cup playoff night has passed, and there\u0027s another headshot and impending suspension to discuss. Once again, the NHL will pay lip service to taking a \"tough\" stand on the type of hits that are a blight on the game.Paul StewartRetired NHL Player and NHL Referee, ECAC Director of Hockey Officiating, Chairman KHL Officiating Evaluation and Discipline CommitteesUniversities\u0027 failures have been manifold. They assume authority and responsibility then fail to deliver the remedies they promise. Institutions that are supposed to act as storehouses of humanistic values seem to abandon those values and look with indifference on the destruction of the lives of their own students.Howard SchweberPolitical scientist, Univ. WisconsinThe drastic decrease in water availability, water mismanagement, agricultural failures, and related economic deterioration contributed to Syria\u0027s population dislocations and the migration of rural communities to nearby cities.Peter H. GleickPresident, Pacific InstituteWhen I was a kid I could tell the difference between the kids who wanted to be my friend from the kids who were my friends so that they could play with my toys. Joel and Joyce are the latter. They preach a twisted form of Christianity that teaches obedience, giving and faith as a way to get things from God.Pastor Rick HendersonPastor, blogger and grace addictThe gun cult has radicalized in the wake of the Newtown tragedy and subsequent mass shootings, especially since our political leaders are silent, held hostage by the gun lobby. In that vacuum of leadership, the size of mass shootings increases and the lethality of weapons continue unabated.Robert L. CavnarFounder, this-small-planet.com, dailyhurricane.comFeeding our children nutritious meals and teaching them that eating vegetables, fruits and whole grains and being physically active can help prevent many diseases should be the nation\u0027s goal.Margaret I. Cuomo, M.D.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027Wear slippers when you have to drive in heels. Wear slippers when you\u0027re traveling. Wear slippers at all moments that it\u0027s even slightly acceptable to wear slippers.Lexi HerrickWriter, Marketing Co-op, and College Student.For us to learn anything from this tragedy we have to wrench ourselves away from his manifesto -- it\u0027s not about him anymore. Leave him to his fate in eternity, and wish solace on everyone.David Palumbo-LiuLouise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityHow has viral veteran Kimmel been overtaken by the upstart Tonight Show host? Because Fallon knows that it\u0027s funnier to laugh at himself than at someone else.Taylor CastiHuffington Post Games FellowWhy write a children\u0027s book about a pit bull? Because these dogs are being massacred. One million pit bulls will be killed in shelters next year, and children can save them.Douglas Anthony CooperNovelist, AmnesiaIn honor of this Thursday\u0027s premiere of Undateable, I thought it would be appropriate to look back at TV\u0027s rich history of undateables. Some were clearly undateable at the time, others only in retrospect.Adam SztykielCreator and Executive Producer, \"Undateable\"As parents of 20-somethings, you may be idling uncertainly between Mother\u0027s and Father\u0027s Days, wondering where you belong, until you realize: you are not out of business yet.Elizabeth FishelJeffrey Jensen ArnettI am insulted when people lump people with mental health issues together like this. As if \"being crazy\" is some sort of umbrella term, a way to explain away any inhuman act a person does.Elad NehoraiPop ChassidRather than serve conventionally raised steak, we recently began sourcing some steak from ranches in Southern Australia, which is among the very best places in the world for raising beef cattle entirely on grass.Steve EllsFounder, Chairman and Co-CEO of Chipotle Mexican GrillOnce known for his versatility, Arturo Vidal has now found his place as a tough-tackling, box-to-box midfielder at Juventus. Also capable of picking a pass, he will offer vital solidity as the likes of Alexi Sánchez and Eduardo Vargas look to shine in a tricky group, which includes 2010\u0027s finalists, the Netherlands and Spain.Eight by EightThe magazine the beautiful game deservesI remember the look on my mom\u0027s face when she heard the news.
