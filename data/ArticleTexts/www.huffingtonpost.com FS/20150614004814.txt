{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundNobody of any age should be held in jail without a trial for three years. No child or adolescent should be held in an adult jail. Yet, a 16-year-old accused of stealing a backpack was kept in one of the most violent adult jails in the United States, Rikers Island in New York City, for three years without a trial. This was morally scandalous and inhumane. Even worse, he spent more than two years of that time in solitary confinement, locked up alone except to go to the shower, the recreation area, the visit room or the medical clinic. This was torture. The suicide of 22-year-old Kalief Browder on June 6, barely two years after his release and return home, was the final horror in his tragic and brutal journey into the depths of the adult criminal justice system in New York.Poll after poll shows that American voters know that free trade in theory can be a good thing -- and that in any case it\u0027s all but inevitable -- and yet they are increasingly skeptical about whether the benefits of it are spread equitably.Global Editorial DirectorThe truth is that there\u0027s not a whole lot of hope for women-owned businesses to reach the same levels of impact and profitability as male-owned ones if standards of gender in the family don\u0027t also change, and significantly.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarGiving our money to help others can be a source of personal satisfaction that outweighs whatever minor frustrations we might experience from having less money to spend on ourselves.Andreas is Deputy Director of Giving What We Can and a Fellow at All Souls College in Oxford.Finding the purpose in life is a key to understanding ourselves and the world around us. The purpose, as Arianna\u0027s quote indicates, is always there, but too often we cannot tap into it to benefit from the wisdom it provides.Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.Israel acts with impunity in seizing Palestinian land, demolishing Palestinian homes and denying basic freedoms to Palestinians. Israel then acts to sanction the Palestinian Authority by refusing to transfer tax revenues that are legally Palestinian funds. But when confronted with a dose of the same medicine, Netanyahu not only screams \"foul,\" he denounces his adversaries as \"anti-Semites\" and threatens severe retaliation.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The timing of the encyclical\u0027s release, three months before the pope\u0027s visit to the U.S. and six months before the climate talks in Paris, shows that the Vatican is being quite strategic about maximizing its impact on the global political system. That is why those who most profit from the status quo have been among the most vocal in critiquing the pope before it has even appeared.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWe do not need other people to take their cameras and claim to know what the world looks like through our eyes. We do not need others to speak over us, pretending to tell our stories, when we have our own voices and our own cameras and are fully capable of documenting our lives.A goth, (steam)punk, wannabe-biker niqaabi feminist who may or may not be Salafi according to your definition thereof.President Obama acknowledges that many lower-skilled workers will lose their jobs if they are forced to compete in a global marketplace. That\u0027s why trade adjustment assistance is needed. But Democrats are horrified by a policy that, whatever the benefits, would end up creating greater inequality.Professor, George Mason University; contributor, Al JazeeraWhat we have come to learn about the gut microbiome in just the past five years has revolutionized our understanding of the role of the digestive tract in body physiology, health, and disease outcomes.Author of The Gut Balance RevolutionStung by the sudden derailment in the House of Representatives of the rush to pass the Trans Pacific Partnership, the Washington establishment has wasted no time in warning us of the menace of a rising China, should the trade deal not be put back on track next week.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyActor, writer, director, producer, and comedianTrue or False? There was no way the Office of Personnel Management could have prevented hackers from stealing the sensitive personal information of millions of federal employees, past and present. If you guessed \"False,\" you\u0027d be wrong. If you guessed, \"True,\" you\u0027d also be wrong.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Calling something sexual assault that clearly isn\u0027t helps no one; worse, it diminishes the trauma of real sexual assault and its consequences.Feminist, environmentalist, writerI was proud to have worked closely with labor, consumer, senior, environmental and faith-based constituencies in working to reject this deal. We need fair trade agreements that benefit workers here and around the world, protect our planet, and promote access to affordable medicines and safe food. The ongoing TPP negotiation does not meet those tests.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtToday I ran across one more xeroxed handout touting the test-taking benefits of music education, defending music as a great tool for raising test scores and making students smarter.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comEver since 9/11, American presidents and their military advisors have repeatedly committed U.S. troops and prestige to inhospitable regions in terrain that largely neutralizes U.S. advantages in firepower and maneuverability. Despite setback after setback, American presidents and generals persist in trying to control hostile territory.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceAs Horner explained in his 2009 book How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn\u0027t Have to be Forever (and in his TED talk on de-extinction), you can turn on dormant genes to get them to build body parts, including a dino-like tail, snout and even teeth. Because of their availability, chickens work well, so Jack intends to build what he calls a \"Chickenosaurus.\"Founding publisher, Skeptic magazine; editor, Skeptic.comDesignating large swaths of the ocean as \"regeneration zones\" isn\u0027t just an idea that sounds good. It is scientifically proven to have significant environmental benefits.Reigning monarch of the Principality of MonacoNow I have a lobster pillow and a faux-coral sculpture I don\u0027t even understand. The only reason I didn\u0027t buy a lamp is there was no room in my cart after the f*cking pillows.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.I\u0027m a self-proclaimed Netflix junkie, and the more marathons I watch, the more I believe that Netflix is slowly guiding me through life\u0027s roller coaster of emotions.TV Advertising Professional. SUNY Brockport Grad. Newlywed.A handful of bills currently in play on Capitol Hill would obstruct federal agencies from enacting science-based rules, setting back health and environmental safeguards for decades to come.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsI am going to tackle head-on the conservative attack on Caitlyn Jenner that has erupted since the Rachel Dolezal story broke. I will leave the response to Dolezal to others to parse, but I will take my colleague, Jonathan Capehart\u0027s advice and \"move along\" to, once again, school the conservatives in biology.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandWhat are the practices that lead to deep spiritual growth? How can fasting help focus attention on what matters? What do those who observe the fast hoping to learn? These are the questions of the Holy Month of Ramadan.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIn September of 1919, nine decades before Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker prevailed in his contentious battle against public sector unions and emerged a conservative hero, a little-known Massachusetts governor named Calvin Coolidge faced a major labor dispute. It\u0027s instructive to compare how Coolidge and Walker galvanized their respective GOP bases.Currently at Revolution LLC; previously the White House, Huffington Post Media Group, and Obama for AmericaParents should be able to send their children to the school of their choice, and they do; but the public should not be expected to pay for their private choices.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027A key aspect of the TPP will be the provision of \"investor-state dispute settlement\" (ISDS).

From Tortilla Crusted Tilapia to Baja Fish Tacos, these easy and fun recipes will get your family excited about eating fish.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomCaitlyn\u0027s coming out has started a national dialogue, but my fear is that it will start and stop there. How can you help? Listen to transgender people when they talk about their needs, help pass legislation that protects transgender people, and of course, continue the conversation that Caitlyn\u0027s photo shoot has initiated.Writer, thinker, social drinker.Victim. While it is not my primary identity, it will always be a part of who I am. Frequently, the media praises victims for \"not allowing themselves to be called a victim.\" As if it were degrading and demeaning words along the lines of \"slut.\"Thriver, TherapistGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
