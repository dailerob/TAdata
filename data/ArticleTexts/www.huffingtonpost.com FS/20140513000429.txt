To put it bluntly, for every 100,000 births in America last year, 18.5 women died. That\u0027s compared to 8.2 women who died during pregnancy and birth in Canada, 6.1 in Britain, and only 2.4 in Iceland. In 1990, the maternal mortality rate in America was 12.4 women per 100,000 births. In 2003, it was 17.6. Now it\u0027s 18.5. That\u0027s not a measurement error because we\u0027ve been measuring the rate of maternal death in the United States the same way for decades. By contrast, the rate has been dropping in most other nations. In fact, we\u0027re one of just eight nations in which it\u0027s been rising. Something\u0027s clearly wrong.Just last week, Republicans got caught in a lie about Obamacare very publicly -- at their own hearing on Obamacare. As failed GOP presidential wannabe Rick Perry would say, \"Oops.\"Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersWhat does it mean when the world hears the same message from the Catholic Pontiff and a French economist?Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryWomen at college should be able to focus on their academic careers and building their lives, without fearing for their safety.Sandra FlukeSavannah BadalichKaya MaslerThe reality is, until things reach a critical point, the world tends to pay no attention to hostilities or challenges in Africa. If you don\u0027t believe me, just take a look at modern history.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkThe story repeats itself every few months. A dictator hires a pop icon to perform at a party or private event. Once exposed, the celebrity faces the ire of human rights activists.Alejandro TarreWriter and journalistBeing a woman (cis, trans or otherwise) means that you grow accustomed to men and sometimes women commenting about your body on a regular basis without provocation.Courtney MeakerMarketing Director, Macha Monkey Productions and Artist Relations and Education Coordinator, UW World SeriesEnemies, innocent victims, and soldiers have always made up the three faces of war. With war growing more distant, two of those faces have, however, faded into the background in recent years.Pratap ChatterjeeAuthor, Halliburton\u0027s Army: How A Well-Connected Texas Oil Company Revolutionized the Way America Makes WarIn today\u0027s NFL full of pass-happy offenses and hybrid defensive fronts, football reasons alone can\u0027t justify why an award-winning pass-rusher like Sam fell so far in the draft.Hank KoeblerSports WriterIt\u0027s important to understand that Boko Haram did not emerge in a vacuum. It is almost a direct result of the failed state that is corrupt and unable to provide even a basic level of safety and services to the country\u0027s citizens.Jacob K. OluponaProfessor of African and African American Studies, Harvard University Faculty of Arts and SciencesNow that I\u0027m an adult out there in the world with a job and a life and responsibilities, I have had to work incredibly hard to \"keep it together.\"Karen Ann KennedyCertified Health Coach and President \u0026 CEO, The Caring Coaching Center, LLC The Caring Coaching Center, LLCAmerica is truly an exceptional country. But America is exceptional not only in good ways, but also in some remarkably bad ways. The power of greedy special interests over our government is as big here as anywhere in the world. One big example: our uniquely messed up way of financing student debt.Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersRand Paul\u0027s fundraising appeal goes on to list the usual scare-mongering attacks on Biden, Feinstein and the rest of the liberal, anti-gun crowd. There\u0027s only one little problem. The president never said what Rand Paul claims he said. He didn\u0027t even come close.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuySpurious George, who has no problem paying for his own healthcare and, at age 73, can always depend on Medicare, doesn\u0027t have much sympathy for ordinary people who couldn\u0027t afford decent healthcare before Obamacare became law.Sandy GoodmanRetired producer for NBC Nightly NewsWhile it\u0027s reassuring to know that I\u0027m in good health, the exam wasn\u0027t the most important part of the visit.

Nothing is difficult to do.\"Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostHow can otherwise uninsurable voters proudly support candidates opposing universal healthcare? Are such voters simply unintelligent? Even more puzzling, how can voters receiving food stamps or other governmental assistance proudly claim to be \"anti-government\"?Harold LloydWake Forest Law ProfessorWe have many things in common, however, there is a major difference between us: I have been refused the right to raise my children with my husband, their father, at my side.Patricia GuillenRetired educator from the Houston Independent School DistrictIt took three weeks for President Obama to publicly address the crisis of over 250 Nigerian school girls kidnapped on April 14 and to pledge to send modest support. That is 22 days of unfathomable cruelty to vulnerable girls.Dambisa MoyoAuthor, \u0027Dead Aid: Why Aid is Not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa\u0027Movies must translate a story to an entirely different medium, and that always means changes. More often than some would like to admit, changes are also needed, in many cases, to find a sufficiently-large audience.Amy M. DavisAn expert in Disney StudiesThe 1992 Nobel Laureate and University of Chicago professor was -- as many are reporting -- one of the most influential economists of the age, just next to Milton Friedman.Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityBecoming a mom should have cured me of taking my own mom for granted. Only it doesn\u0027t seem to work that way. It\u0027s a process. With every milestone my kid hits, I make a new discovery about my mom.Farah L. MillerManaging Editor, HuffPost ParentsWhat troubled me most was that Kerry, after acknowledging that many Israelis have offered the same warning, apologized for using the word \u0027apartheid\u0027 saying that \u0027it is a word best left out of the debate here at home.\u0027 In other words, Israelis can have this debate, but we can\u0027t.James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The slice of pizza is a staple of New York\u0027s culinary heritage and part of the soul of the city. You can\u0027t really go wrong. But, for those still looking for some more direction, here is a list of some incredible neighborhood pizzerias.Corey MintzGraphic designer, pizza enthusiast, Knicks fanAs we all know from the marriage debates, the opinions of others on our sexuality affect our daily lives. While the overwhelming consensus of the transgender community is that a person is whatever they identify as, others (including sometimes the government) base it on other things. The problem is it\u0027s done completely inconsistently.Brynn TannehillDirector of Advocacy, SPART*AWhile no American is immune from the risks of gun violence, the sad fact is that this crisis has a disproportionate impact on people who identify as Hispanic.Josh SugarmannExecutive director, Violence Policy CenterMark May 8 on your calendar: The 2014 NFL Draft will be the last time Johnny Manziel finds himself overlooked by the NFL.
