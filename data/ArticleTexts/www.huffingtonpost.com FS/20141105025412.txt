{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressWith another midterm election very nearly in the books, it\u0027s time to take stock of the cycle\u0027s campaign ads. The best of the best inspired us with full-hearted positivity, shrewd arguments and personal stories that humanized the candidates. The worst of the bunch featured easily punctured deceptions, shameless exploitation of tragedies real and imagined, and desperate measures undertaken by justifiably doomed competitors. Meanwhile, somewhere in the space between respectable and reprehensible, some of your bravest ad-makers rolled the dice with talking chickens, sharknadoes, dream ballets, and half-naked men staggering out of the water to yell at you for seemingly no reason. This is where most of the money spent by goofy billionaires trying to buy this election went.Hating Obama should not be an effective political organizing strategy, but is indeed in the absence of any effective Democratic backbone to counter right-wing absurdities. Democrats deserve their losses; they ceded the battle before it began.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyWe\u0027ve launched a dedicated section on The Huffington Post, ReWork: Rethinking Work and Well-being. Here you\u0027ll find success stories, news about what\u0027s working, innovative programs, case studies and the latest data about the many positive business effects of well-being and sustainable work practices.Something has to give. We have a serious health crisis in America and it\u0027s impacting a whole lot more people than the Ebola virus.Author, Producer, AdvocateProducer and AuthorAs folks know who are either familiar with the data or live in the real world, the economy is still bad for most people. President Obama can rightly say that he inherited a mess from his predecessor, but at some point that does get old. He can also honestly blame the Republicans in Congress who have eagerly proclaimed their opposition to any economic proposal that doesn\u0027t have the primary purpose of making the rich even richer. While the grim reality can offer legitimate excuses, the Democrats still suffered from the fact that they didn\u0027t have a real economic agenda for the bulk of the population. The Republicans at least have a clear agenda. Everyone knows if they get back in control they will give everything left on the table to the richest 1 percent. But what would the Democrats do?Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The theme is legal tax-evasion -- by this country\u0027s very rich -- enabled and encouraged by both sides of the political aisle on Capitol Hill.Contributing editor, Vanity FairIt\u0027s nothing new to feel like our intelligence is being questioned. There has always been a sense that we\u0027re being talked down to and that most of what is said is gibberish to placate and appease us without really saying anything of substance.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comEven if you believe government has no role banning large sodas or taxing sugar, do yourself a favor -- cut sugary drinks out of your diet. It could be the difference that saves your life.CEO and President of Mount Sinai Health SystemClinical director of the Mount Sinai Diabetes CenterMindfulness is not complicated. It\u0027s something we can all do: notice things. By just standing back and being aware, you immediately gain a new view of your inner and outer world along with internal changes in the brain.Popular comedian and bestselling author of \u0027Sane New World\u0027So many conversations are initiated and shaped by women on Twitter. Important conversations about terms that used to fly right by me in their ideological camouflage: Rape culture. Misogyny. Privilege, gender bias, slut-shaming.Writer, comedian, and author, \u0027Funny On Purpose\u0027Republican control in both houses of Congress might not actually be the worst thing for the Obama administration. It might actually be to Obama\u0027s advantage on two key issues -- trade and immigration.Attorney, foreign policy writerApple became the world\u0027s most valuable company for a number of complex reasons, including the design genius of its brilliant founder. But when you look under the surface, it is more open than you might think.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027At 47, with several projects on the horizon, the last thing one hopes for is a visit from Parkinson and for him to overstay his welcome.PeriodistaTo seal the deal and truly begin to close a harrowingly destructive chapter in American history, voters going to the ballot box Tuesday need to understand how the War on Drugs has failed, in every way, for over forty years.Award-winning filmmaker, public thinker, and authorSometimes it seemed that only two issues mattered in the midterm election campaigns just ended -- two issues on the lips of politicians nationwide, at the top of the news 24/7, and constantly trending on social media: ISIS and Ebola. Think of them as the two horsemen of the present American apocalypse.Editor, TomDispatch.comIf the Republican Party takes full control of the U.S. Congress in the midterm election, policy gridlock is likely to worsen, risking a rerun of the damaging fiscal battles that led last year to a government shutdown and almost to a technical debt default. More broadly, the gridlock will prevent the passage of important structural reforms that the U.S. needs to boost growth.Chairman of Roubini Global Economics, Professor of Economics at the Stern School of BusinessKnowing what to say and how to act in your campaign\u0027s lowest moment can be the spark that helps you kick-start your next successful run for office. It\u0027s an audition for the role you didn\u0027t know you were up for. In short, people are watching. Make it good.Professor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityVoters are facing an ugly surprise on their way to the voting booth on Tuesday. What most people don\u0027t realize is that since 2006, some 34 state legislatures have worked diligently to chip away at the fundamental right to vote -- and overwhelmingly, people of color are the target.Director, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeThe results taken together are consistent with a view of the political extremist as thoughtful and confident, not unthinking. This does not mean of course that extreme political positions are necessarily sound or that they are not biased in other ways, but it does raise doubts about the mindless ideologue stereotype.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027If you\u0027ve ever wondered what Lizzie and Jane\u0027s lives would have been like if their overbearing mother could reach them 24/7 to discuss their dwindling marriage prospects, look no further than Ortberg\u0027s wonderfully playful book. The only thing missing? Bridal emojis.Co-creator of The ToastSo far there haven\u0027t been very many progressives willing to stick their head out there and say they\u0027re willing to take on Team Hillary. I understand that the Washington media is saying that she can\u0027t be beat. That\u0027s hilarious. Isn\u0027t that exactly what they said in 2008?Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027Here are ten unusual words that sum up the writing experience, and our attitudes to writing, in one way or another.Author; Lecturer in English, Loughborough Univ.One need not look far and wide to discern Netanyahu\u0027s disingenuousness and misguided policies that have only undermined Israel\u0027s future security. He uses his political skills to deceive and mislead in order to \"protect himself from political defeat\" while disregarding what is best for the future of the state.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUYou would think that TV stations have a public-interest obligation to cover government, public affairs, important issues -- stories citizens need to know. After all, stations owners pay nothing for the licenses the public gives them to broadcast over the airwaves the public owns. But if you believe that, you\u0027d be wrong.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIt would be comforting to think that life and death decisions are made more deliberately than traffic navigation, but this is not the case. Indeed, they are often at least as rushed and impulsive, with emotions running overwhelmingly high.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachThe next time the Pentagon congratulates itself on another \"good year\" for arms transfers, Congress, the public, and the press should take a closer look at how those arms are being used. Being the world\u0027s leading arms trading nation is nothing to brag about.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyThe landscape of Peacekeeping is clearly changing. Blue helmets are not regarded with the same political neutrality they once were. Peacekeeping is more dangerous than ever for roughly 120,000 men and women serving in 16 missions around the world, and we must take measures to protect them.Vice President, UN FoundationMom didn\u0027t want or need to support or condemn the gay lifestyle or any lifestyle, for that matter. Instead, she chose to follow the teaching of Jesus and endorsed his commandment to \"Love one another.\"Author, syndicated blogger, featured humor speaker, publisher, and retreat organizer knows that laughter - with wine - is the best medicine.There is still suspense over what will happen on Election Day, with control of the Senate hanging in the balance. But regardless of who wins, we already know the 2014 election belongs to the U.S. Supreme Court.Democracy Program Director, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of LawDeputy Director, Brennan Center for Justice Democracy ProgramIn the red zone, a faith in the deliverance of everydayness, a sober belief in tasks and duties, in moving forward with the daily agenda, is sustaining people and families and communities. A simple adherence to the components of quotidian, city life remains a quiet defiance to the sectarian destruction that encircles it.Author of \u0027The Shock and Awing of America: Echoing Consequences of Fear and Alienation\u0027I went back to the data to uncover the kinds of things that emotionally intelligent people are careful to avoid in order to keep themselves calm, content, and in control.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"O: WORST SENATE MAP \u0027SINCE EISENHOWER\u0027 ON THE BALLOT: 36 Senators... 36 Governors... 435 House Members... 6,000 State Legislators...
