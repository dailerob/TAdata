{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From cnn.comReutersAPThe State of the Union address was the hottest topic on the Post this week. I live-blogged the speech, as did the wickedly funny Bob Cesca. Don\u0027t miss the SOTU takes of Ted Kennedy, Amy Ephron, Jesse Kornbluth, Nancy Pelosi, Paul Hipp, John Conyers, RJ Eskow, Dan Carol, Trey Ellis, Jerry and Joe Long, Paul Rieckhoff, Nina Burleigh, Robert Schlesinger, Tom Gilroy, Nicholas von Hoffman, Bob Barr, Patt Morrison, Andrew Bacevich, and Craig Crawford, as well as those in our Sunday Roundup below. And be sure to check out the latest offerings in our Contagious Festival which is now up and running.READ POST | comments02.01.2006 Rep. John MurthaIs the world safer today with the gains of Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon? Is the world safer with an emboldened Iran? Is Iraq or the region more stable as a result of our military intervention in Iraq?READ POST | comments (154)02.01.2006 Nora EphronSo I had to fall back on my fallback position and try instead to watch the speech. But of course that can\u0027t really be done. It\u0027s not possible. Everyone attempts to. Everyone is dutiful. But everyone is just faking it.READ POST | comments (104)02.01.2006 Lynda ObstWhat if you have phone sex with a person in a middle eastern country. A person just visiting that country, for example. Is your phone tapped? A girlfriend wants to know.READ POST | comments (57)01.30.2006 Roy SekoffGuessing how long it will take before President Bush invokes 9/11 in a speech is one of our favorite diversions at the Huffington Post.READ POST | comments (175)01.31.2006 Sen. Harry ReidIt wasn\u0027t credible to hear the President talk about making America more secure and honoring our troops without hearing him explain why he\u0027s done the opposite for the last five years.READ POST | comments (120)02.04.2006 Gary HartIt is totally outrageous for Karl Rove to condemn Democrats (too many of whom voted to invade Iraq.) It is Mr. Rove and president Bush who had a non-9/11 worldview.READ POST | comments (51)01.31.2006 Marty KaplanTo take the SOTU as gospel, you\u0027ve probably got to have the mindset of someone who still thinks that Saddam planned 9/11. Or that Iraq won\u0027t descend into civil war the moment we leave, whether it\u0027s in six months or six years. Or that spaghetti grows on trees.READ POST | comments (11)01.31.2006 Sen. Russ FeingoldMy first reaction to the President\u0027s speech is that we didn\u0027t hear anything new, and we didn\u0027t get any real answers.READ POST | comments (108)02.01.2006 Arianna HuffingtonToday, Jack Murtha delivered a killer Democratic response to Bush\u0027s State of the Union address, filled with passion, insight, perspective, and loads of specific details. It\u0027s the one we should have heard last night.READ POST | comments (135)01.30.2006 Adam McKayIf you want to know what these Republicans are all about, see what they accuse others of being -- anti-American, anti-troops, liars, etc.READ POST | comments (85)02.03.2006 Murray WaasPresident Bush might have been briefed regarding former ambassador Joseph Wilson\u0027s February 2002 CIA-sponsored mission to Niger during a regular morning intelligence briefing.READ POST | comments (61)02.01.2006 Matt StollerIf you want to know how a real campaign against the nomination of Alito would\u0027ve looked like, here\u0027s one version of what you might have seen.READ POST | comments (45)02.02.2006 David CornThis is a rather big deal. The president of the United States caught conspiring to create a modern-day version of the sinking of the Maine? Talk about an impeachable offense.READ POST | comments (121)02.04.2006 Jesse KornbluthSo now Chris Matthews suggests the torched churches in the South may have been burned by liberals or gays. He needs help --- and to get it, I fear, he must leave his show.READ POST | comments (152)02.04.2006 Michelle PileckiThe \"good news\" is \"I think Iraq will be the last big military intervention,\" the IPS quotes David Carment, of Canada\u0027s Carleton University. It is much cheaper to prevent conflicts or collapse of countries in the first place.READ POST | comments (12)02.01.2006 Robert ScheerThe trial of Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling opens a new window on the outrageous practices of our modern-day robber barons. But the politicians who benefited from Lay\u0027s largesse and changed the law enabling Enron\u0027s chicanery are going unpunished and even uncriticized.READ POST | comments (17)02.01.2006 Jane HamsherPerhaps NARAL thought the battle over Samuel Alito was already lost and not worth fighting, but they don\u0027t appear to have been telling people this when they were pumping them for money.READ POST | comments (34)02.04.2006 Martin GarbusThe Democratic Senators are now exercised by the possibility that Bush will appoint his own man to take over the investigation. Why did the Democrats put themselves in this position? Was it foolishness or something else?READ POST | comments (56)02.02.2006 Tom TomorrowSocial psychologists are using brain scans to study political bias. One psychologist observed that the way the study\u0027s subjects dealt with unwelcome information had curious parallels with drug addiction.READ POST | comments (34)01.31.2006 Harry ShearerRe: Gov. Kaine: maybe he\u0027s bucking for a cabinet position when Karl Rove decides it\u0027s time to let a Democrat on board to help with the heavy bailing.READ POST | comments (20)AFP/Patrick BazFrom washingtonpost.com/ReutersFrom newsweek.com/F.
