{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027The hypocrisy manages to be both stunning yet also banal, even predictable. It\u0027s not rocket science. Sgt. Bergdahl was never a living, breathing human to these people -- just what the director Alfred Hitchcock would have called a \"MacGuffin,\" an insignificant prop that exists to drive the real storyline, and that storyline is tearing down Obama as an un-American pretender to the White House. In 2013, Obama was a coward who didn\u0027t understand our most basic principle of \"no man left behind.\" In 2014, Obama was a treasonous dictator who put the nation at risk to rescue an undeserving deserter who should be court-martialed, maybe executed. The two narratives are ridiculously, laughably contradictory except for one element: They both involve a president named Barack Hussein Obama.The truth is, corporations aren\u0027t people -- despite what the Supreme Court says. Corporations don\u0027t break laws; specific people do. In the cases of GM and Credit Suisse, the evidence points to executives at or near the top.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The impact of what we call the Internet Of Everything (IOE) is all about providing connected intelligence to improve everything, whether we\u0027re talking about driving innovation or increasing the speed of decision-making or raising standards in health care and education.Jeanne Beliveau-DunnVice President, Learning@CiscoWhen I read about the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, polio or pertussis, I worry -- and wish that there wasn\u0027t so much fear about vaccines.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolMillions of Americans may soon become part of an expanded government database that would give two federal regulatory agencies an up-close and personal view of their private financial lives that, if breached, could make for a really bad day for a whole lot of people.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911We are at home in the new surveillance state, for we barely register all the cameras, all the targeted advertising, all the intrusions into what had previously been considered sacred private space. We are not passive objects of observation. We are active subjects of our own YouTube channels.Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThanks to Snowden, we now know the Internet has become a giant government spying apparatus dependent on the complicity of companies we use everyday.Writer, documentary filmmakerOne of the biggest challenges small businesses face is the ability to attract and retain talent. Yet people are the most important resource of any small business, so what is a small business owner supposed to do?National Academic Director, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small BusinessesOur children\u0027s children will want to know why we were so selfish and short-sighted; why did we not listen to the biblical ethic of stewardship? This is certainly a matter of science, but until it also becomes an issue of faith, we will not have the social movement that we need to change our whole way of fueling our lives.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersAs we move into the urban century, water is likely to be one of the defining issues for cities. Getting it right will be critical to meeting public health and economic development goals.Director, Securing Water StrategyAlthough it\u0027s not always easy to walk away when your doe-eyed child is pleading with you to do something for him or her, helicopter parenting is just not a good thing. You may not want to see your kid fail. But adversity is part of life and the only way to teach our children coping skills is to make them do things for themselves.Senior Editor, HuffPost 50Hill\u0027s apology was genuine, coming from someone who knew he\u0027d let down his friends, his fans, and himself, and who was ashamed. It came from someone who had thought deeply about what he\u0027d said and what the ramifications were and realized that he couldn\u0027t just delete it out of his life.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesMartha Gellhorn was the first woman -- landing upfront, and the only female journalist with a brilliant first-hand story of the invasion.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s Organizations\"We found all the cough medicine bottles in your desk,\" she said, flatly. \"Either you drink as much water as you can until you throw up, or I\u0027ll be forced to take you to the hospital.\" Terrified of my secret getting more exposed, I opted for water. They fired me the next morning.The stuff that hooks us.I firmly believe there must be swift and certain consequences for all crime, but I also believe that the way our system deals with low-level, nonviolent and non-serious offenders wastes resources needed to fight more serious crime.California Attorney General and author of Smart on CrimeIn preparation for this, the 70th anniversary of the Allied invasion of Normandy, I revisited what I feel are the two finest cinematic representations of this pivotal confrontation in the Second World War. Both moving tributes to the heroic men who fought and died on the critical day that turned the tide in the Allies\u0027 favor.Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comDespite the onslaught of attacks against freedom of expression in Iran, the international community has largely averted its gaze until now, when Pharrell Williams\u0027 smash hit song \"Happy\" thrust Iran\u0027s dismal human rights record back into the spotlight.Actress, activist, spokesperson for Amnesty International USACitizens, and especially media pundits, should pay attention Gen McChrystal\u0027s words and remember that America does not leave soldiers -- even ones who make mistakes -- in enemy captivity.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications.The Bergdahl controversy is almost a caricature of American political discourse in the Obama era, with both sides taking strong and outspoken positions based simply on whether or not they like the president.lincolnmitchell.comExelon\u0027s brazenly dishonest campaign against wind and other renewables has outraged environmentalists and nuclear watchdog groups. But it also has aroused the ire of some of its own industry fraternity members.Director of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsThe Europeans should be put on notice that unless they significantly increase their defense spending, they will have to face Russia on their own when Putin moves next. True, the US has taken it upon itself to maintain a liberal global order, but this does not mean that it has to engage in every local or regional conflict.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityImmigration judges regularly decide the fate of immigrants -- and their often U.S.-based families -- in less time than it takes to make your way through airport security.Legislative Counsel, ACLUBy June 6, 1944, World War II touched just about every family and community in America. We have not participated so personally in anything like it since, and we have grown apart from the men and women who continue to fight and die in conflicts that require only our tax dollars for support.Washington, D.C.-based writer, editor, and photojournalistThe data also showed that reporters who identified as \"activists\" were more than twice as likely to be denied access. This bias against activist media may make sense to some, but the authors of the report point out the slippery slope this trend suggests.Director, Journalism and Sustainability at the Geraldine R. Dodge FoundationThe suggestion that I won some battle, or beat something, is just telling me that you think that the people who have died from cancer somehow didn\u0027t fight hard enough? That\u0027s bullshit, and you don\u0027t mean that.Writer, Comedian, ManNo system is without its flaws, and the VA is no exception. There are more than 14,000 full-time physicians in the VA system, many of whom have passed up higher paying or more prestigious jobs to work with veterans. The problem is an issue of access, not quality of care.Physician, Portland VA Medical CenterPresident Obama has an opportunity to shift the Fed\u0027s direction in a way that would be both economically transformative and politically popular. He has an opportunity to make the central bank an institution which reflects and serves the people who created it. It\u0027s also what the law requires.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourIn the 21st century, with one out four Americans affected by mental illness, our country urgently needs a mission to the mind; after all, the brain is the last unchartered territory on earth.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralHe might have stopped at one of his favorite taco trucks on the way home. But if not, he\u0027s starving! So what does he grab when he walks in the door? It\u0027s probably not what you think.Blogger, EmulsifiedFamily.com\"I don\u0027t understand. I\u0027d feel better if you wore a reflector.\" It\u0027s because you\u0027re 6\u00274\" and 220 pounds and a man. You think about getting hit by a car. I think about being attacked. I think about it every time I step out of the door to run alone... whether at 3:30 a.m. or 3:30 p.m.Blogger, Writer, MomThere is a deep and urgent need for Americans to understand that the current problems within certain VA facilities are not rampant and system-wide. And I would bet my life that the nurses and staff at the centers being investigated carry out their duties with the same compassion and caring that my father-in-law is receiving at this very moment.U.S. Navy veteran and writerI say don\u0027t wait to discover what\u0027s truly important.
