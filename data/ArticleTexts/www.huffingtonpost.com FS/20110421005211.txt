{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The first poll results since the president\u0027s big speech on the economy last week are in -- and they\u0027re not very good. According to a new Washington Post/ABC News survey, the president\u0027s approval rating continues to fall, driven by fears about the economy. Back in the heady days of the 2008 campaign, a powerful, impassioned speech like the one Obama delivered would have had a definite positive impact on the numbers. But the soaring rhetoric now comes with a bitter aftertaste. We got used to the president making strong promises and then caving -- from closing Guantanamo to not extending the Bush tax cuts for millionaires. Now he\u0027s making strong promises he\u0027s already broken. He\u0027s like a political version of the Guy Pearce character in Memento -- he\u0027s figured out a way to break promises outside of the limitations of linear time.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 04.20.2011Editor, Eat the PressThe Obama birther issue reached a new level of resolution today when George Stephanopoulos brandished Obama\u0027s Certificate Of Live Birth at Michele Bachmann, to which the congresswoman replied, \"Well, then that should settle it.\"Read Post | CommentsTrish Regan, 04.20.2011Author, \u0027Joint Ventures: Inside America\u0027s Almost Legal Marijuana Industry\u0027Portugal shows the best way to keep kids away from pot is to make it legal for everyone else.Read Post | CommentsSen.
