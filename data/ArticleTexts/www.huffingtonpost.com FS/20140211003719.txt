{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jonny Bentwoodchief innovation officer, Edelman BerlandIt is the duality of individual-initiated and business-led courage that creates an optimal formula for progress. The courage to identify a pivot, and the freedom to be able to see that change through, is what\u0027s required to show up differently. And if you\u0027re lucky, like I am, that is exactly the culture of the company you work for. If you have that freedom, here are my recommendations to be courageous within it.CommentsArianna HuffingtonI\u0027ve been away from blogging for a while, spending all of my free time in a remote land called Bookville -- a place with strange, ancient customs. For instance, writing something and not publishing it immediately! But while I had my head down writing a book about meditation, mindfulness, sleep, stress, and the need to redefine success, there was an explosion of these same themes everywhere in the culture. Every day there really are more and more conversations happening about the benefits of mindfulness and sleep and stress reduction. And not just in outlets that write about these topics on a regular basis, but in every part of the media landscape.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Watching the film American Hustle, we can enjoy a sublime, over-the-top \u002770s show, as well as some civic satisfaction that some corrupt officials actually went to prison. Meanwhile, the ultimate American Hustlers are still on the street, laughing all the way to the bank.Comments (27)Jordan K. TurgeonSenior Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWould I be checking because I genuinely wanted to see all those pictures and status updates? Or would I be checking out of some strange obligation now that it was \"allowed\" again? I hadn\u0027t missed social media during my time away, so why go back?CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhat Michael Sam did took tremendous strength and valor. Not only did he proclaim his truth to the world, but he did so knowing that he could very well lose a lot in the process.CommentsJeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Here\u0027s why I hate the convention: The stand-up has zero journalistic value. It wastes time. It wastes precious reportorial resource. It turns the world into a mere backdrop for entertainment. It\u0027s a fake.CommentsKristen Welchwearethatfamily.comI can confirm the temperature because I have known the extremes: a cold marriage, filled with contempt and misery. A lukewarm marriage, perhaps the worst, filled with idle days, stagnant affection and distant intimacy. We have lived every season.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageHow can bad news on Main Street (only 113,000 jobs were created in January, on top of a meager 74,000 in December) cause good news on Wall Street?Comments (60)Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghInstitutions in the United States are not meant to be owned by those who lead them. They are not possessions to be disposed of according to the will and inclination of managers or governors.CommentsJames PeronPresident, Moorfield Storey InstituteGay athletes aren\u0027t the ones who have to worry about being kidnapped and tortured by anti-gay gangs, with videos of the crimes put online to share with other bigots. Iraschko-Stolz speaks from a unique position of privilege, one denied to actual victims.Comments (12)David HearstEditor, Middle East EyeSisi\u0027s rise from career officer to national savior is reminiscent of another man who has set back the cause of democracy in his country by decades: Vladimir Putin.CommentsBruce AckermanProfessor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027The present system of checks and balances is broken. Now is a good time to consider serious reform. Neither Democrats nor Republicans can be confident that they will win in 2016, and reap the short-term rewards of the next round of unilateralism.Comments (18)Katla McGlynnComedy Editor, The Huffington PostThe last time we saw \"The Walking Dead,\" everyone had separated while fleeing the smoldering prison -- everyone except The Governor and poor Hershel, who both lay dead in the prison yard.CommentsJonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillIn a world in which character often reduces to maintaining proper decorum as media and (often belligerent) fans define it, it\u0027d be nice for there to be a little more acknowledgement of the reality of race in America and the extent to which it informs the world of sports.CommentsRaymmar TiradoWriterBecause while you\u0027re out spending your money on new outfits, new cars, overpriced meals or nights at the bar, I\u0027ll be investing in myself. And while you try to fit in with the world I\u0027ll make the world fit in with me.CommentsMichael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027The fact that global surface temperatures have not increased as much over the past decade as many climate models predict they should have, doesn\u0027t necessarily contradict the model predictions at all.Comments (55)Marty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIf you\u0027ve been on an aboriginal walkabout, you may not know that, until yesterday, Flappy Bird was the most popular iPhone and Android app on the planet. Its appeal lies neither in its crappy graphics nor its nonexistent story, but in its addictive difficulty.CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsIf there\u0027s one thing about life that I wish everyone would consider -- particularly my peers, and those younger than me -- it\u0027s that you\u0027ll never do the big things if you\u0027re waiting until you\u0027re ready to do them. You\u0027ll never be ready.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWhile the ACA is flawed in some respects, the CBO report pointed to one of its strongest features: by at least partially uncoupling health care coverage from employment, it is unfettering workers from jobs they would prefer to leave.Comments (15)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesPublicly, the NFL is being supportive, putting out a statement saying, \"We admire Michael Sam\u0027s honesty and courage,\" but in Sports Illustrated numerous unnamed sources say Sam\u0027s going to be a \"distraction\" and not a problem any team is going to want to take on.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorTonight on PBS, I have an open and transparent conversation with award-winning actress and best-selling children\u0027s author Jamie Lee Curtis. The star candidly discusses her personal struggle with addiction and her 15 years of sobriety, among other things.CommentsBill RobinsonBusiness, Technology, Entrepreneurship \u0026 Rock \u0027n Roll JournalistFacebook isn\u0027t real or productive, it\u0027s just an advanced version of the electronic bulletin boards that have been around since the Internet dawned. Nobody on those old boards met their \u0027soul-mate\u0027 or bought a car; or paid their bills; or broadcasted their political opinions; or flamed each other for disagreeing.CommentsSoraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderWhat will it take for our mainstream culture to teach children that it is unacceptable to talk about and treat other human beings in these ways? There are ways for boys to express their masculinity, create fraternal bonds and explore their sexuality that do not turn girls and women into \"sluts.\"Comments (25)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgIf you\u0027re curious about what I used to do as a PR guy for the health insurance industry, how I often took facts and figures and twisted them to advance a specific political or financial agenda, take a look at the behavior of some members of Congress last week.CommentsDeepak ChopraCo-author, \u0027Super Brain\u0027; Founder, The Chopra FoundationThe fact that the Supreme Court invalidated state laws against homosexuality was the bellwether of a shift in acceptance that will only accelerate. It\u0027s time, then, to consider another dimension that has been masked by the headlines over legal battles. That\u0027s the dimension of spirituality.CommentsJoah SpearmanCo-Founder \u0026 CEO, LocaleurI won\u0027t be dishing out any advice on how to find some secret stash of hotel rooms in this post so good luck with that. However, what I can give you is the scoop on how to experience SXSW like a local.CommentsJoe HansenInternational President, United Food and Commercial Workers UnionWhile Congress continues to block President Obama\u0027s effort to increase the federal minimum wage, workers have taken the lead in tackling income inequality by sticking together and challenging big corporations to change the way they do business.CommentsAnnabel MonaghanAuthor and blogger, www.annabelmonaghan.comWhen he leaves in the morning, I\u0027m in my pajamas and the kitchen\u0027s a mess. When he comes home at night, I\u0027m in my pajamas and the kitchen\u0027s a mess. How can I explain to him that, though the pajamas are the same, the mess is a totally new, fresh mess?CommentsMaxwell StrachanBusiness Editor, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s not that I\u0027m some sort of reckless spender who blows money on ridiculous things like cab rides or vegetables. I just have one indefensible and enormously bad habit and I have a hard time admitting it even to myself: I rack up ATM fees like a complete moron.Comments (93)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans believe, for example, that business should be free from the kind of government regulation that would prevent chemical companies from spewing poison into West Virginia drinking water. When it comes to freedom for workers, though, the GOP is all about squelching that.Comments (87)Lauren DucaAssociate Entertainment Editor, The Huffington PostWhile many elements of Allen\u0027s piece have been deemed false, there are also a number of rhetorical choices Allen makes that deserve closer analysis.Comments (169)Rana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeThis Valentine\u0027s Day, why not throw the clichés out the window? Forget the stress of date night and those over-priced dinners. Think creatively about celebrating love.CommentsSELF, 2014.10.02Li Keqiang, 2014.10.02Terri Weiss, 2014.10.02Michael Giltz, 2014.10.02Wayne Besen, 2014.10.02Ben Shapiro, 2014.10.02Rick Tumlinson, 2014.10.02Margaret Paul, Ph.D., 2014.10.02Rabbi Jason Miller, 2014.10.02David Kaiser, 2014.10.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SWAMPED BY SUBPOENAS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
