{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe way out of war is always peace. The way out is not limited, well-tailored, well-spoken, discreet, \"smart\" shots across the bow which you pretend are not acts of war. But peace comes from negotiations: an activity of which this president has always spoken in the warmest terms but at which he has shown few results during five years in office -- not in Afghanistan, not in Iran, not with Russia or China, not on global warming or nuclear proliferation. Why not start with Syria? It is smaller than those other cases, and peace there might lead to peace elsewhere. It will be unsatisfactory, no doubt. And deeply disappointing to people who admire speed and decision and the chance to wrestle with fortune while employing the largest weapons in the world. But it will be better than the multiplication of deaths.Comments (292)Joshua PragerAuthor, JournalistIt was not until last month -- 23 years later -- that I considered that my visions in the intensive care unit were related to the visions that had come upon me, off and on, in the years since.Comments (22)Arianna HuffingtonSolvitur ambulando -- \"it is solved by walking.\" This phrase refers to the 4th century Greek philosopher Diogenes\u0027s response to the question of whether motion is real -- he got up and walked. \"It is solved by walking.\" As it turns out, there are many other problems to which walking is the solution.Comments (116)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWhere do markets collectively stand on Syria? Here are four things to note as we enter a weekend full of political maneuverings and difficult decisions.CommentsKathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Over and over we have told ourselves, surely this latest attack on another country must have something to do with national security; surely our government has the big picture in mind and surely our government wouldn\u0027t put us in the same kind of fix yet again.CommentsNeal Barnard, M.D.President, Physicians Committee for Responsible MedicineIt sounds like a scene from a horror movie: injecting rabies into beagle puppies and watching as they succumb to one of the most miserable of diseases. This isn\u0027t fiction. It\u0027s a cruel experiment that is real and imminent.CommentsJoseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorThe British parliament\u0027s vote against going along with the United States\u0027 attack on Syria is a direct result of that country\u0027s attempts to come to terms with the lies of the Iraq War.Comments (306)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, we launch \"Invisible Casualties,\" a month-long series that examines the ever-growing -- but not widely discussed -- issue of suicide in the military.CommentsMichael SteelePolitical analyst; Fmr. Chairman, Republican National Committee; Fmr. Lt. Governor, MarylandDr. King\u0027s speech challenged the status quo of his time and now so must we. But we must first answer for our generation the question often asked of him: \u0027When will you be satisfied?\u0027CommentsHeather RoffVisiting Associate Professor, Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of DenverThat the Syrian regime used chemical weapons does not necessarily entail that the U.S. becomes the international judge, jury and executive to dole out punishments. Indeed, reprisals are subject to strict criteria.Comments (38)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostReligion will be positively affected by the Internet to the degree that we own what we think and approach one another via the web with all the same integrity we maintain in our interactions offline.Comments (234)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Comments (93)Scott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D.Author, \u0027Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\u0027; co-founder, The Creativity PostWhile introversion, sensitivity, and narcissism are all partially separate traits, hypersensitive covert narcissists are more likely to report that they are introverted and sensitive.Comments (17)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundJanol\u0027s good grades allowed him to attend an excellent magnet high school but he realized he didn\u0027t see his own experience reflected in the curriculum. He wants to see a new kind of teacher training become a priority throughout the educational system.CommentsMike DunnProud Nutmegger, Univ. of Nebraska graduateIt\u0027s been described as a meltdown, but it really wasn\u0027t. At no point during Dave Chappelle\u0027s show at the Oddball Festival in Hartford was he ever anything other than in measured control of his actions. I was part of the audience at the show.CommentsLes LeopoldAuthor, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)Today, much of the \"strength, prosperity and well-being\" of our hard labor is being siphoned into the coffers of Wall Street. Perhaps, in honor of our labor we should remind ourselves how we are being robbed blind.CommentsDoug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteObama administration policy toward Syria is a slow train wreck. Unremitting pressure from war-minded elites is pushing President Barack Obama closer to military intervention in the bloody civil war. Yet getting involved would be a fool\u0027s errand.Comments (498)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The dream was more than the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, which both followed in the years after the history-changing 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It finally was about King\u0027s vision for \"the beloved community.\"CommentsNida KhanIndependent journalist; Radio correspondent and producerWhen the rhetoric against the Assad regime and Syria is eerily parallel to that prior to the Iraq war, wouldn\u0027t it make sense to wait, and to ask our leaders for actual information and proof? Are we ready to allow our government and the governments of our allies to commit such drastic action under our names yet again?Comments (35)Eva M. Selhub, M.D.Medical Doctor, executive coach, motivational speaker, and author of The Love ResponseHow you perceive yourself influences more than you realize. It determines how you experience your life and more so, how you handle uncertainty and adversity.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe meaning Labor Day has been dulled by both rampant commercialism and public apathy. Shouldn\u0027t Labor Day be a time to gather, contemplate and celebrate more just treatment of all those who toil without proper recognition or compensation?CommentsRoss LuippoldHuffPost Comedy Deputy EditorAudiences must learn how to respect Dave Chappelle, or we might lose him for good.CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027The British Parliament\u0027s rejection of an attack on Syria is a direct contrast -- and implicit challenge -- to the political war system of the United States. Now all eyes turn to Congress, where the bar has suddenly been raised.CommentsSharon Kay EdwardsPerformer, hoarder of books, coffee addict and librarian in trainingYou gave him the moon, Mr. Jedi Master. You fixed his day... his entire vacation! You got him back on track.Comments (59)Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027While some people will never offer or accept amends, it appears that others are able with time to forgive. But why is that? Is there a fundamental psychological difference between those who accept reparations readily -- or even seek them out -- and those who do not?CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorThe best way to remember Martin Luther King is not to think of him as a statue or an icon, but to take to heart his example. He said no. He resisted. He said, we will not acquiesce to what we know is wrong. How does that apply to the situation of public education today?Comments (14)Sean LeeDoctoral student, Department of Political Science, Northwestern UniversityPlease, don\u0027t let the conflict in Syria be about opposing America. Let it be about Syria, and what might actually help Syrians -- you know, the actually existing people who are dying by the tens of thousands in this brutal war. But if you can\u0027t do that, then do me a favor, and please shut up.Comments (49)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowDr. King challenged the United States to do better; to make good on the \"promissory note\" of our founding documents, while warning that we should never revisit the grotesque sins of our collective past. But we still have so much work to do.Comments (164)Russell KorobkinDirector, UCLA Law School’s Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Program; Author, \u0027Negotiation Theory and Strategy\u0027The president\u0027s only hope of shaping the behavior of a nation like Syria with threats of potential military action is by pledging American credibility in future diplomatic encounters as collateral for the threats.CommentsRichard C. Senelick, M.D.Neurologist, author, blogger and international speakerI frequently hear my able-bodied friends say, \"I would rather be dead than be a quadriplegic, have a severe stroke or a brain injury.\" Bold talk from the strong and healthy, but what would they really choose?CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt takes a special kind of magic to bring together groups as diverse as progressive Democrats, Californians, conservative Republicans, feminists, a number of prominent economists, and a large chunk of the global investment community. Lawrence Summers has that kind of magic.CommentsLarry Atkins, 2013.30.08Daniel Altman, 2013.30.08Inesha Premaratne, 2013.30.08William H.
