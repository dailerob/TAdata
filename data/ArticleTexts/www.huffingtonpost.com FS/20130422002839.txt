{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, the president called the Senate\u0027s rejection of gun control a \"shameful day for Washington.\" The media had a few shameful days of its own, led by the New York Post\u0027s appalling (and inaccurate) \"Bag Men\" front-page photo. In the end, an extraordinary effort by law enforcement and the public (including the hospital bed ID offered by the grievously wounded Jeff Bauman) brought a rapid, if surreal, end to the hunt for the perpetrators of the Boston bombings. \"This has been a tough week,\" said the president, \"but we\u0027ve seen the character of our county once more... They failed because we refuse to be terrorized.\" The best way to continue that refusal is to stay true to our values.Comments (77)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorApril 15 now so sadly known for both. One a privilege for living in a free county, the other perhaps a price.Comments (232)Patton OswaltComedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesThe vast majority stands against that darkness and, like white blood cells attacking a virus, they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evildoers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak.Comments (719)Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupDid you know where Chechnya was? You probably do now. The Tsarnaev brothers were legal immigrants. They were granted political asylum from a Chechen war that they have now brought to Boston, whether they wanted to or not. Back in the Caucuses, Chechens want their own country. But so do we. And now that is impossible for us both.Comments (686)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI love the New York Yankees, but I\u0027ll be honest with you. After this week\u0027s tragedy in Boston, I began to wonder if it would ever feel safe to attend a game again. If the Boston event confirmed one thing to us, it\u0027s that mass violence has officially entered the public square, and that we can never know who -- or what -- the next target will be.Comments (114)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityMuch speculation revolves around the fact that brothers are ethnic Muslim Chechens from the Caucasus region where an intermittent, yet bloody conflict has existed for the last two decades, but nationalist sentiment has existed far longer than that.Comments (544)Nancy RappaportAssociate professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical SchoolAs the hostage negotiation continued and we sat down to dinner, I prayed that we\u0027d come out of lockdown a safer, more caring community. I loaded the plates and raised a glass, with the hope that my fellow citizens will find the strength to heal.Comments (35)Anya SchmemannDirector, Task Force Program, Council on Foreign RelationsMoscow has long claimed that Chechen rebels have close links with al-Qaeda, that Arab fighters joined Chechen fighters during the wars, and that some Chechen militants joined the fight in Afghanistan. These claims may receive additional U.S. attention after the Boston events.Comments (92)Huffington PostAs Boston was in lockdown mode Friday, April 19, while law enforcement agencies continued the manhunt for suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, we invited those in the area to blog about their experience. The following slideshow contains those Notes from the Lockdown.Comments (68)Nathaniel FrankAuthor, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027Should we have to adopt a belief we don\u0027t really hold in order to feel part of the larger American family who were collectively targeted on Monday, and who are grieving and searching for answers as part of one people?Comments (754)Patricia Watson, Ph.D.Senior educational specialist for the National Center for PTSD and assistant professor at Dartmouth Medical School in the Department of PsychiatryMany people directly exposed to mass violence will have traumatic stress reactions, and such reactions may occur off and on, even years later. But these reactions should not necessarily be regarded as pathological responses or even as precursors of subsequent disorder.CommentsBeth MurphyDocumentary filmmaker/JournalistHere, in this war-torn country, I stay glued to CNN, BBC and Al-Jazeera (stations covering nothing but the Boston manhunt), and am reminded that the people I meet here, just like my neighbors and friends at home, wish for peace -- not just for themselves, but for everyone.Comments (14)Lorenzo VidinoSenior fellow, Center for Security Studies, ETH Zurich, SwitzerlandOver the next few days we will learn more about Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, from their childhood in Central Asia and their arrival to America up to the last days before and after their alleged attack against the Boston Marathon.Comments (118)Frank WarrenFounder, PostSecret ProjectI began collecting and sharing secrets in 2004. I printed 3,000 self-addressed postcards with simple instructions about sharing an artful secret. I passed them out to strangers on the streets of Washington, D.C., not knowing what to expect.Comments (46)Arianna HuffingtonBREAKING! This just in: the economy is terrible and the country is suffering its worst jobs crisis since the Depression... developing... Of course, this isn\u0027t actually breaking news, it\u0027s aching news -- and before the tragic bombings in Boston, the most important story going on.Comments (699)Tony BennettRecording artistWhen it is harder to obtain a library card than it is to buy a gun in this country, something is terribly wrong. I mean, would you let your neighbor drive 100 miles an hour in their car through your children\u0027s school zone?Comments (610)Bianca JaggerFounder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationThe trampling of indigenous rights, military force used against protesters, impunity, megadams and environmental destruction. Is Brazil returning to the bad old days?Comments (83)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027When real or imagined grievances combine with rage, religious fundamentalism, political extremism, mental illness, or emotional instability, we lose the common good to dangerous violence, fear, and deep distrust in the social environment.Comments (272)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorDespite all the lasting harm caused by the casino capitalists, the big banks are now bigger, richer and more powerful than they were when they were bailed out in late 2008. The only ones who were punished were the U.S. taxpayers.Comments (273)Randi ZuckerbergFounder and CEO, Zuckerberg Media; Editor-In-Chief, Dot ComplicatedAs parents, if we are going through all this effort to install these apps on our children\u0027s phones, we need to make sure we don\u0027t turn around and engage in the same harmful behavior ourselves.Comments (64)Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsEven the most cynical amongst us were stunned when the U.S. Senate voted down a watered down, bipartisan, partial background check for gun purchases that\u0027s supported by some 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members. This happened because money has near-complete control of our political system.Comments (443)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowYou want to know what is going on in Boston after the attacks on the town\u0027s storied marathon? Check out this message from my friend, former Marine Captain Ryan McGill. Even the closing of city streets for a manhunt hasn\u0027t deterred his desire to keep an even keel.Comments (23)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio hostHarrison Ford reflects on the importance of America coming to terms with racial reconciliation and the humanity and particular genius of black fellow citizens.Comments (28)Jim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupThe world has seen great progress in getting children into school over the past decade. Yet 61 million children are still out of class -- that\u0027s 61 million too many.Comments (11)Amber HindsMother, certified lactation counselor and blogger, Au CoeurNo one would breastfeed for a year (which is really just the minimum recommendation) if we could not continue with our lives while doing so. If we were stuck at home, unable to go shopping, eat at restaurants or play with our older children, it would be impossible.Comments (960)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe same reasoning that leads Justice Scalia to conclude that the Framers\u0027 ignorance of cell phones and the Internet doesn\u0027t resolve questions about \"the freedom of speech\" should also lead him to the Framers\u0027 ignorance about the nature of sexual orientation. If one is going to be an \"originalist,\" at least one should be consistent about it.Comments (885)James FrancoActor and authorIt\u0027s my 35th birthday, not that anyone should care. Here\u0027s a poem I wrote on my 31st birthday. I have done a few things in the past four years, but this poem still captures how I feel on my birthday.Comments (63)Keith OlbermannWriter, Baseball NerdThe kid looking at the camera, the kid Jackie Robinson seems to be looking at?
