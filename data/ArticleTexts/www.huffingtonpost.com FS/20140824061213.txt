{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week was dominated by news from Ferguson -- but much of what was really happening went untold by the media. While TV viewers were mostly presented with endless images of tear gas, violence and division, a fuller depiction would have revealed a community challenged by adversity, underrepresentation and institutional failure that responded with remarkable empathy, kindness and trust. At HuffPost, in addition to covering the protests, the failure of those sworn to serve the citizens of Ferguson, and the entrenched role of race, we also tried to shine a light on how the community came together -- cleaning up, handing out food, and raising money. There was a lot more love than looting in Ferguson, more compassion than conflict. How the media covers a crisis matters -- and showing only one side breeds cynicism about what we can become. The brave citizens of Ferguson have risen to the occasion. I hope the media will join them.The idea that America had reached some level of post-racism with the election of Barack Obama was always delusionary. But it was true that great strides had been made in the half-century or so that followed the civil rights movement. Now, because of the persistence of racism and a relaxation of the fight against it, we are moving backwards.Distinguished Senior Fellow at Demos, former New York Times columnistWhat happened to James Foley is the unthinkable. But he is not gone: The memory of him, and those like him, drives me to be a better journalist, a better person. The task of bearing witness to conflict can be fatal, but it is important. And anyone who thinks intimidating or killing journalists will stop the truth from coming out is sorely mistaken.Middle East correspondent, The WorldPostThink you have a pretty good idea of what\u0027s going on in Ferguson, Missouri? You may not, even if you\u0027ve been watching a lot of cable news. Especially if you\u0027ve been watching a lot of cable news. If the media\u0027s job is to give viewers and readers an accurate and full idea of what\u0027s really going on, we have to acknowledge that there is a long way to go. Of course, Ferguson is not an isolated case. But it is a chance for those of us in the media to expand our understanding of our role in covering the news. At HuffPost we are certainly covering the violence and the underlying racial tensions, but we are also committed to telling the \"untold story\" (as our splash put it on Tuesday) -- of compassion, ingenuity, kindness, trust, collaboration and community.My support of the petition has been attacked as anti Semitic. I understand anti Semitism to be a hatred of Jews, the denial of the right for Jews to have a homeland, the denial of the horrors of the last century and the plight of the Jewish people throughout history. This is obviously not my position, anti Semitism, Islamaphobia and homophobia are all prejudices that I resolutely reject, like any right-minded person. In the context of the accusation that I face, anti Semitism must be taken to mean opposing big businesses making profit from violence against Palestinian people.Actor and comedianPolice are equipping themselves with a variety of high-powered firearms because they feel outgunned by the criminals they have to defend themselves against.Professor of Law, UCLAThis week, friends of South Sudan and members of the Diaspora wrote a letter to the leaders of South Sudan reminding them of the vision and the determination that inspired their struggle and achieved their success.Founder and board chair, Humanity UnitedNo one who cares about the death of Michael Brown, or the scourge of police brutality, can ever choose not to vote, again. Period. Not only did people die so that you could vote, people die because you do not vote.Author, \u0027FREESTYLE: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture\u0027; Founding Pastor, Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church, Dallas, TexasAs responsible citizens we must demand that our government exercise all influence to bring the Israeli government to honest, productive negotiations with the Palestinian unity government, to achieve lasting justice upon which an enduring peace, security, and prosperity can be achieved by all.Actor, producer and humanitarianIt is not a great time to be a journalist in America.Communications strategist at the ACLUShould they now begin to contemplate taking bold steps and change direction, which appears to be inconceivable at this juncture? I believe that in the long run they will have no other choice. Yet, however incongruous this may seem, it is better to be a fool who tries than a wise man who never dares.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUNo wonder Americans feel powerless. No surprise we\u0027re sick of politics, and many of us aren\u0027t even voting. But if we give up on politics, we\u0027re done for. Powerlessness is a self-fulfilling prophesy.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027There is something deep in the American psyche which resents and resists military-style force in our neighborhoods.Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateIn recent years, oil and gas developers have been agitating for the first new lease for off-shore drilling in California waters since before the Santa Barbara oil spill. And where the project would be located? You guessed it: just miles from the site of the 1969 disaster in Santa Barbara County.Actor; board member, OceanaI hope every Black leader, parent, grandparent and preacher will mount a united and irresistible voice to end the structural exclusion of millions of children from the education and other opportunities required to keep them from dead-end lives.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs I watched with a sickening sense of deja vu the images coming out of Ferguson, MO this week, I couldn\u0027t help but come to this conclusion: we have allowed a pernicious historical revisionism to undermine the legacy of the civil rights movement.Host, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027How, in the modern age, can a state put on such sham proceedings, open to the world, and get away with it?Lawyer, activist and authorRape is not like stealing a bike. Women -- or men, for that matter -- do not have a responsibility to \"lock themselves up\" to avoid rape.Senior Editor/Reporter, The Huffington PostAs you take one last look over your shoulder to make sure that your little one is safely tucked into her classroom, and you wipe away the tears as you climb back into your (suddenly very quiet) car, remember this.Mother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comThis is an argument for understanding the role that gender plays in problems and their effective solutions. Factors that contribute to higher risks for women are gender role expectations, gendered poverty and the impact of boy preference on education, nutrition and resource allocation -- before, during and after events.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)This is a generation that experiences animals, nature and the great wonders of our world behind the safety of four-inch screens instead of understanding how to live among them in reality.Executive editor, The DodoClergy and lay people have played a crucial role in Ferguson. These religious leaders provide a buffer at protests, press for justice for Michael Brown, and witness against systemic racism and inequality.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThere are no shortcuts in business. In order to be successful there are some things that you must know. These are not all of them by a long shot, but IMHO they are 6 of the most important.Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVWhile their videos have been unquestionably successful in terms of raising awareness (1.2 million videos uploaded) and funds ($13.3 million contributed) on behalf of an intractable disease, they have overlooked the most important message of all: vote.Co-Founder, OurTime.orgCatcalling isn\u0027t about flattery, the men aren\u0027t doing it to make you feel beautiful or special. They\u0027re doing it because of a sense of entitlement. Because to them, every woman is fair game regardless of what time of day it is or where you are or what the woman is doing.If the type of telescope described here can be built, then the tyranny of distance is vanquished. You can forget deep space probes and their long travel times. We could explore alien worlds in the comfort of our own homes, as our laptops scroll and zoom through data sets collected by a mammoth, space-based telescope array.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe need for these drugs is greatest in the countries where the epidemic is raging. Their residents come first. Because clinical trials for safety and efficacy can be carried out only in such countries, even the \"compassionate use\" of an unproven drug in severely limited supply should be granted first to inhabitants of the nations that have been most severely affected.Professor of epidemiology \u0026 population health, Albert Einstein College of MedicineSuicide is still such a taboo that most people are afraid to open up about what\u0027s going on with them without fear of some kind of judgment. It\u0027s important to be able to confront these incredibly scary issues without so much fear.Editor in chief of HelloGiggles. Former editor in chief of Yahoo Shine.
