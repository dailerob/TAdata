{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Producing more original video has been one my top goals for HuffPost for a couple of years now. That\u0027s why when our founding editor Roy Sekoff came to me with the idea for HuffPost Live -- a streaming network that would use HuffPost\u0027s stories, editors, bloggers, and commenters as its real-time script, I knew we had found the right vehicle for bringing HuffPost\u0027s voice, attitude, and disruptive approach to video. It was also an innovative way to tap into our active and passionate HuffPost community and the world\u0027s growing hunger for self-expression. People don\u0027t want to just consume news; they want to be part of shaping the story of our time. I could tell you about all the cool features of the HuffPost Live platform, and explain the thinking behind our community-first approach, but since HuffPost Live is now just that -- live! -- why not go see for yourself? Click here to be part of a different kind of conversation.Read Post | Comments (34)Steve Clemons, 08/13/12Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027America has budget challenges and these need to be met, but to forsake investment in the future assures a dumber future for the nation. This is what is at stake, and the debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan is the vital exchange that Americans must hear in deciding the country\u0027s course.Read Post | Comments (66)Geoffrey R. Stone, 08/13/12Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoHow much of a difference will it make to the Supreme Court whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins the 2012 presidential election?Read Post | Comments (34)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 08/13/12Author, research psychologist, and gender expertIt\u0027s no longer true that men cheat far more often than women do. A study conducted last year by researchers at Indiana University in Bloomington found that women and men cheat at about the same rate -- though for different reasons.Read Post | Comments (57)Bill Moyers, 08/13/12Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThis was never Romney\u0027s party, and without Karl Rove\u0027s shadowy money behind him, he would not have survived the primaries. But in Paul Ryan, the Golden Boy from Janesville, they finally have one of their own -- a true believer for the new Gilded Age.Read Post | Comments (243)Sara Austin, 08/13/12Features director for News and Health, SELF magazineHow twisted is it that skinny remains the default ideal even when a woman is pregnant? That bulge wasn\u0027t bloat--it was a growing baby girl.Read Post | CommentsJames Zogby, 08/13/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027We made hamburgers at McDonald\u0027s. We were both altar boys and we remain practicing Catholics. And Paul Ryan and I both read Ayn Rand as teenagers and were captivated by her radical individualism. That, however, is where the similarities end.Read Post | CommentsBarbra Streisand, 08/13/12Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistThe new laws requiring US citizens to produce photo IDs at the poll are designed to deprive elderly and minority citizens of the precious right to cast their vote. These regressive laws are themselves the most dangerous voter fraud threatening American democracy.Read Post | Comments (105)Lucille Lang Day, 08/11/12Author, \"Married at Fourteen\"At sixteen I filed for divorce before a lot of girls my age had even been kissed.Read Post | Comments (149)Robert Kuttner, 08/13/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The last thing the economy needs now is tighter money. But watch for op-eds and speeches by the inflation hawks pointing to rising food prices and calling for higher interest rates.Read Post | Comments (70)Mark Hyman, MD, 02/18/12Practicing physicianMy personal hope is that together we can create a national conversation about a real, practical solution for the prevention, treatment, and reversal of our obesity, diabetes and chronic disease epidemic. Getting off wheat may just be an important step.Read Post | Comments (595)Stacy Keach, 08/13/12ActorOur shows document the stories of fraudsters at large, on the run, who have evaded the authorities. There is a reward offered for information leading to their arrest and conviction. Hopefully, we will be able to apprehend one of them as the result of exposing them.Read Post | CommentsIra Weissman, 08/13/12Founder, www.TruthAboutDiamonds.comConsidering my deep personal involvement in the diamond business, my opinion might surprise you -- diamonds are a terrible waste of your money.Read Post | Comments (151)Abby Huntsman, 08/12/12Political Commentator and Host for HuffPost LiveSo, while the economy will continue to be the number one issue on voter\u0027s minds, let us not forget that a hands-on understanding of global markets and practices is more important than ever in keeping America economically competitive.Read Post | Comments (642)Naveen Jain, 08/13/12Founder: Moon Express, inome, InfoSpace; Board: X Prize, Singularity UThere is no longer a doubt that women are just as competent as men. Gender differences are guided by nurture as society treats boys and girls differently from an early age.Read Post | Comments (12)Brad DeLong, 08/13/12Professor of Economics at the University of California at Berkeley and a Research Associate at the National Bureau for Economic ResearchI don\u0027t want to hire as my vice president and federal budget czar somebody who uses Congressional inside information to profit by switching his portfolio back and forth between Citigroup and Goldman five times a year: I want somebody with better ethics.Read Post | Comments (82)Alan Schroeder, 08/13/12Professor of Journalism, Northeastern UniversityThis year\u0027s vice presidential debate promises to be a more substantive exercise than 2008\u0027s Biden-Palin extravaganza -- which, for the record, outdrew all the Obama-McCain debates in the ratings.Read Post | CommentsValarie Kaur and Simran Jeet Singh, 08/13/12In the wake of the shootings of Sikh Americans in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, many Americans may silently wonder: If turbans mark Sikhs as targets for hate and violence, then why not take the turban off?Read Post | Comments (53)Leo W. Gerard, 08/13/12International President, United SteelworkersThis guy, Edward DeMarco, the acting head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is deliberately damaging America -- promoting foreclosures, high unemployment and excessive taxes. He has got to go.Read Post | Comments (144)Michael Brenner, 08/13/12Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIn picking Paul Ryan as his running mate, Mitt Romney has given some small hope that the election will restore progressive thinking to its legitimate place in our political discourse. The lines are now drawn for a stark confrontation that the White House and Democrats cannot avoid.Read Post | Comments (55)Trey Ellis, 08/13/12Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityYou know it\u0027s 2012 when Chris Rock and Julie Delpy star in a romantic comedy. 2 Days in New York is not only the funniest but the most contemporary and authentic romantic comedy to come out in years.Read Post | CommentsRebecca Juro, 08/13/12Freelance journalist, blogger and Internet radio talk show hostWhen you compare the two issues side by side, the logic is both obvious and unavoidable: Gaining nationwide anti-discrimination protections in the workplace is a far easier and less time-consuming task, politically, than achieving nationwide same-sex marriage.Read Post | Comments (12)Jared Bernstein, 08/12/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWhat can we expect the presumptive Romney-Ryan ticket\u0027s perspective to be on tax policy, retirement security, the safety net/poverty, inequality, mobility, investment in public goods, market failures, health care?Read Post | Comments (82)Ethan Casey, 08/13/12Author, \u0027Alive and Well in Pakistan\u0027Like Wisconsin, America at large is bitterly at odds with itself. A starting point for recovering our national community is to acknowledge that we all, whichever side we\u0027re on, face the same question: What kind of country do we want to live in?Read Post | Comments (34)Eric Zuesse, 08/12/12Investigative historianIf Fareed Zakaria didn\u0027t actually do this plagiarism, could he very well announce to the world \"I didn\u0027t do it; I didn\u0027t even research or write the article\"? No. Zakaria wouldn\u0027t want to burst the bubble atop which he is floating.Read Post | Comments (136)Allen Frances, 08/13/12Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThere is no doubt that most of us have become hooked on our electronic devices, and that some people are gravely harmed by what develops into an unhealthy and uncontrollable attachment to them. The question is how best to understand, define, and deal with this.Read Post | CommentsJames Zogby, 2012.13.08Ricardo B.
