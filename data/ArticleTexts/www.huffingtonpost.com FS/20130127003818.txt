{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDon’t let anyone tell you current gun safety regulations are working just fine. They aren’t. The massacre at Sandy Hook woke up many Americans to the epidemic of gun violence, which has snuffed out the lives of 148,000 children since 1968 -- this is the equivalent of 7,400 classrooms of 20 children and teens. Every 30 minutes a child or teen is shot in the United States. Every 3 hours and 15 minutes a child dies from gun violence. It’s time to say “no more.” We can free our nation of this scourge of gun violence. No external enemy ever took the lives of so many children and adults. We can and must change this. I am confident that most Americans value children’s safety and right to live more than they value the right of anyone to have assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines. If America can’t stand up for its children, it doesn’t stand for anything.Read Post | Comments (696)Max Little, 01/25/13MathematicianCurrent symptom tests are done in a clinic.

And because many women therefore know quite well what it\u0027s like to feel judged, they then turn that judgment back on one another.Read Post | Comments (166)Gary Hart, 01/26/13President, Hart International, Ltd.When will Democrats rightly claim to be the most knowledgeable, thoughtful, experienced, imaginative leaders on defense of our nation?Read Post | Comments (34)Mark Cuban, 01/26/13Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, HDNetThe smart high school grad no longer just picks a school, borrows money and wings it. Your future depends on your ability to assemble an educational plan that gets you on your path of knowledge and discovery without putting you at risk of attending a school that is doomed to fail.Read Post | CommentsJohn Pavley, 01/26/13CTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI personally do not believe the U.S. Government is controlled by shadowy figures lurking behind a smoke smoke screen of faux democracy. If anything, the political and social events of the last few years are evidence that no one is ultimately \"in control\" and that every player is each equally frustrated.Read Post | CommentsMichael Moore, 01/25/13Oscar and Emmy-winning directorThat really should be the main takeaway from Zero Dark Thirty: That good detective work can bring fruitful results -- and that torture is wrong. Eight years of torture -- no bin Laden. Two years of detective work -- boom! Bin Laden!Read Post | Comments (518)Gene Gurkoff, 01/26/13Founder, Charity MilesAs a mobile app developer myself, this has got me thinking of other ways we could use the other features of modern smart phones to efficiently crowdsource Parkinson\u0027s research.

And Howard Fineman kicks off our new series, \"The Road Forward: Obama\u0027s Second Term Challenges,\" putting the spotlight on the issues that will define Obama\u0027s second term: from poverty, education reform, and foreign affairs to bank regulation, the environment, and immigration.Read Post | CommentsKate Orazem, 01/25/13WriterI want to offer something like an elegy.

Stuart and Robert E. Lee who directed massive armies. These gun nutjobs today have -- who? -- Ted Nugent.Read Post | Comments (3,381)Paul McCartney, 01/24/13MusicianGrowing up in Liverpool, I would have thought of a vegetarian as a wimp. I\u0027ve been a vegetarian for a long time now and over the years I\u0027ve seen how the attitudes have changed around the world, so I\u0027m not surprised when I see new research that shows more and more people are increasingly adopting \u0027meat-free eating.\u0027Read Post | Comments (507)George Hobica, 01/25/13Syndicated travel journalist and founder of Airfarewatchdog.comIf you haven\u0027t visited lately, or ever, please do stop by.
