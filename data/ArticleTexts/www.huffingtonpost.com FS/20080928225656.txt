{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOHow busy imploding was John McCain this week? Over three crisis-laden days, he couldn\u0027t find the time to read Sec. Paulson\u0027s original 3-page bailout plan. How not-ready-for-prime-time was Sarah Palin? When pressed to cite an example of McCain pushing for oversight of Wall Street, she told Katie Couric: \"I\u0027ll try to find you some, and I\u0027ll bring \u0027em to you.\" How bitter was Bill Clinton? He couldn\u0027t stop singing McCain\u0027s praises, from Larry King to The View to Letterman to GMA. How much did Joe Biden need a history book? He claimed, \"When the stock market crashed, Franklin Roosevelt got on television.\" How unhinged was Newt Gingrich? He called McCain\u0027s campaign suspension gambit \"the greatest single act of responsible leadership ever taken by a presidential candidate.\" How steamed was David Letterman? See for yourself.Read Post | CommentsBIONora Ephron, 09.27.2008There was a moment, when the debate ended and the wives came up on stage, where I actually knew, or thought I knew, who had won. I\u0027m sorry to say it, but it was John McCain.Read Post | Comments (755)BIOEve Ensler, 09.28.2008Paul and Joanne taught me that the only real happiness comes from giving. And because they lived everything they spoke, they taught me about integrity.Read Post | CommentsBIOJohn Ridley, 09.19.2008According to a rather weepy piece in the Wall Street Journal, Rush is upset that the Obama camp is portraying him as being a bigot. By quoting bigoted statements he\u0027s made.Read Post | Comments (723)BIOAlec Baldwin, 09.28.2008You can think about him hobbling on a crutch, feigning indifference, while Elizabeth Taylor urged him on in her lingerie. The two most beautiful actors in all of film, and they just argued.Read Post | Comments (88)BIORobert Shrum, 09.26.2008Tonight I think we know who the next President will be. McCain kept repeating that Obama doesn\u0027t \"understand.\" But he clearly did. McCain made up no ground.Read Post | Comments (671)BIOCarl Bernstein, 09.25.2008It is time to confront an awkward but profound question: whether in picking Palin as his running mate, McCain has committed -- by his own professed standards of duty and honor -- a singularly unpatriotic act.Read Post | Comments (609)BIOArianna Huffington, 09.27.2008It was a good night for Obama because, when 83 percent of the country believe we are on the wrong track, standing toe-to-toe with McCain on foreign policy is all you need to do. And Obama clearly did that.Read Post | Comments (472)BIOPaul Slansky, 09.23.2008You\u0027re not fooling anyone, Bill, and it\u0027s not going unnoticed. We see your rage -- it\u0027s too huge to hide. We see that it pains you to even speak Obama\u0027s name.Read Post | Comments (2074)BIOEugene Jarecki, 09.25.2008I encourage McCain and, for that matter, anyone in Washington who\u0027s drunk the Gipper\u0027s free-market fundamentalist and gun-toting expansionist Kool-Aid, to spend a bit more time reading Eisenhower.Read Post | Comments (133)Madeleine Albright, 09.26.2008Tonight was a breakthrough for Obama, who showed himself truly ready to be president. He responded knowledgeably, thoughtfully and confidently to the toughest questions on the economy, Iraq, and terror.Read Post | Comments (534)BIONorman Lear, 09.25.2008It\u0027s a good bet that if Goldman Sachs makes it through, Mr. Buffett\u0027s involvement will prove to have been a smart one as well as a bailout. Why not call in Mr. Buffett as the people\u0027s representative?Read Post | Comments (107)BIOSean Penn, 09.26.2008The result tonight was another frustrating piece of American media that is at once far too polite, and at the same time, dismissive of an American public\u0027s need to know anything beyond jingoistic self-aggrandizement.Read Post | Comments (303)Suzy Shuster, 09.23.2008Andy Borowitz, 09.24.2008Henry Blodget, 09.23.2008Max Blumenthal, 09.24.2008Bob Cesca, 09.24.2008Jane Smiley, 09.26.2008David Bromwich, 09.25.2008Ricky Van Veen, 09.25.2008Seth Greenland, 09.25.2008Ilan Goldenberg, 09.25.2008Jon Soltz, 09.24.2008Joe Trippi, 09.27.2008Bill Press, 09.27.2008Mark Green, 09.27.2008Barbra Streisand, 09.28.2008David Sirota, 09.28.2008Elissa Altman, 09.28.2008Bruce Tenenbaum, 09.28.2008Linda Bergthold, 09.28.2008Tony Sachs, 09.28.2008","h1":"Using a mobile device?
