{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonIn the preamble of the Constitution, we are told that we are constantly moving toward a more perfect union. And while people in every age think they\u0027re living in a time of transition, ours truly is an age of transition when it comes to the rights of gay Americans. It\u0027s in the zeitgeist -- in the courts, in pop culture, in the business world and in people\u0027s voices online and offline. On Sunday, the Oprah Winfrey Network is featuring a lineup of programs about being gay in America. It begins with Oprah\u0027s Next Chapter -- with conversations between Oprah and gay celebrities including Wanda Sykes, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Dan Bucatinsky -- and continues with the premiere of Bridegroom, a documentary from Designing Women creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason.Comments (50)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Comments (57)John HudakFellow in the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, Managing Editor of the FixGov BlogKathleen Sebelius will stay, and Republicans have no one to blame but themselves. Why is this? In an ironic twist of fate the Republican Party\u0027s obsession with filibustering, delaying, or holding executive branch nominations will finally have negative consequences for the GOP instead of the president.CommentsLori LeibovichExecutive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington PostMy family and I went dark for 24 hours from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. I buried my iPad under a pile of books, stuck my iPhone in a drawer, and hid the TV remote from my kids.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWith all these instances of Big Brother encroachment, one might want to opt out of the digital world entirely. Unfortunately, that is becoming more and more difficult in an increasingly technology-obsessed world.CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe possibility of losing control of the House is beginning to stare GOP strategists in the face. Do they really want to risk incensing a big block of Hispanic and other immigrant voters by blocking immigration reform, and energizing them to go out to vote in large numbers to punish Republicans?Comments (114)Kate BartolottaOwner and founder, Be You Media GroupBeing introverted has nothing to do with lack of confidence. In some ways, I believe that the ability to enjoy being by yourself says a great deal about your confidence.Comments (147)Brett GallaherFounder, WeOccupyJesus.orgThis may come as a shock, but despite what your ex says about you, you\u0027re probably not going to Hell. Relieved? Good! But I hate to break it to you that your ex isn\u0027t going to Hell either.Comments (539)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur nation\u0027s gun violence epidemic is not inevitable. Scholars must be allowed to do the desperately needed scientific research that will help parents, policymakers and the public determine how we can all work together to stop it.CommentsCecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesWhen it comes to Ken Cuccinelli, women in Virginia aren\u0027t buying what he\u0027s selling. Turns out the more Virginians learn about Cuccinelli\u0027s positions on women\u0027s health, the less likely they are to vote for him.Comments (14)Cheech MarinActor, comedian, activist and art collectorWhile much of the nation has insurance by Allstate, Farmers, or Blue Cross, the approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country have only holy water and a prayer to protect them from financial disaster.CommentsLyndsi FrandsenFounder and co-author of the blog, For All MomkindIt\u0027s our responsibility, as mothers, to do everything in our power to make sure we aren\u0027t (even unknowingly) raising mean girls.Comments (331)Maryann JacobsenRegistered dietitian, mom of two, freelance writer and co-author, Fearless Feeding How to Raise Healthy Eaters from High Chair to High SchoolAs parents, we all say things to encourage our kids to eat healthier. Yet, in our modern, food-centric environment, even well-intentioned comments can be translated into negatives that hinder eating.CommentsCarolyn GregoireFeatures Editor, Huffington Post Healthy LivingTrivializing and misusing a sacred tradition to sell luxury (not to mention sizeist) yoga clothing is not only embarrassing, it\u0027s offensive.Comments (191)Brie DyasIf my college-age neighbors are any indication, the next generation is an absolute mess.I\u0027m not even talking about \"life\" messes (finding a job, getting married, etc.) but physical messes. This is my grandmother\u0027s generation\u0027s nightmare.Comments (77)Trita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilAdelson\u0027s extreme comments are not innocuous, they carry great consequence. They carry political consequence given that Mr. Adelson is a major donor to many politicians, Middle East-focused think tanks and advocacy groups, and prominent Jewish organizations.CommentsThrillistWe\u0027re a quick, free, daily e-mail ...Here are 15 ways to immediately get under your bartender\u0027s skin... things you should never do to the person who controls the trajectory of your life, err, night.Comments (15)Sen. Jay RockefellerU.S. Senator, West VirginiaThe U.S. was once a global leader in building and maintaining our infrastructure, but that\u0027s no longer the case. After decades of under-investment in our roads, airports and air traffic control systems, rails, and ports, we have fallen far behind -- and it\u0027s staring us in the face.CommentsRabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterWhether media commentators saw Sheldon as being serious or purposefully using exaggeration in order to make the larger point that the United States must go to extremes to ensure that Iran never gets a nuke.CommentsMike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostMy point is that just because the script for Episode VII is being completely reworked doesn\u0027t mean we are in store for any kind of disaster. (To be fair: It doesn\u0027t mean we aren\u0027t either.) But it\u0027s that this kind of thing happens and it happened almost the same way 35 years ago.CommentsJason Vargo and Jonathan PatzCities in the U.S. have been struggling to \u0027pave their way out of congestion\u0027 for decades. It doesn\u0027t work.Comments (30)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistNothing inspires me more than a young girl who has strength, confidence and a healthy self-image. Which is why I\u0027m so proud of New York City for launching its new NYC Girls Project, a public awareness campaign designed to remind girls, ages 7 to 12, that self-esteem isn\u0027t built by slipping into a pair of designer jeans or cool shoes, but by celebrating who they are inside.CommentsJohn MarcotteWeb designer, writer and occasional political satiristMy girls have tiaras and gowns in their dress-up box right next to their capes and masks. They have a drawer full of Barbie dolls that live in peaceful coexistence with their action figures. But I think it is important for them to know that looking pretty is not the only option they have in life.Comments (24)Mark GodseyDirector, Ohio Innocence Project; Carmichael Professor of Law, University of Cincinnati College of LawHow could 10 witnesses have all said they were certain a defendant was the perpetrator of the crime, when DNA testing later proved that he was innocent?CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027It\u0027s time to be honest about the deep-seated sense of race in the heart of our national politics. But when people of color speak the truth about the realities of race in our culture and politics, they are always accused of \"playing the race card.\"Comments (199)Kathleen PeddicordPublisher, Live and Invest OverseasWhen it comes to retiring young and retiring overseas, you can\u0027t really expect a little help from your friends. Declare that you intend to retire young and/or move abroad, and your existing world will oppose you.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorThe international test scores are poor economic barometers. What matters most in the decades ahead is the extent to which we cultivate creativity, ingenuity, curiosity, innovation, and thinking differently.Comments (197)Jilly GagnonWriterThat wasn\u0027t your fault, the ridge got in the way. Just take a wet paper towel and wipe away that line and redraw... you know what? It\u0027s gonna be fine.

Yet the recent debate over Syria evoked expressions of concern in Washington that Americans were once more turning their backs on the world.Comments (82)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowThis Pope seems to realize that while exclusion reduces vulnerability, it also reduces empathy and compassion.
