{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI yield to no one in my anger around the performance of some of the websites where far too many people are enduring deep frustration to sign up for coverage on the new health care exchanges. But there is an obvious danger of over-interpreting this unfortunate, time-limited episode. First, the introduction of big, complex policies like this always invoke big implementation challenges. But the larger point is this: many of us have literally been working on health care reform for decades -- three decades, in my case. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, advocates in particular and the nation in general scored a milestone victory.CommentsMartin ReesMember of the Oxford Martin Commission for Future Generations; Fellow of Trinity College, University of CambridgeWithout reliable performance indicators, the effectiveness of governments and international organizations cannot be measured and it is impossible to create the right incentives for improvement.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Conservative Republicans have lost their fight over the shutdown and debt ceiling, and they probably won\u0027t get major spending cuts in upcoming negotiations over the budget.But they\u0027re winning the big one: How the nation understands our biggest domestic problem.Comments (154)Arianna HuffingtonAs part of our site-wide focus on well-being and sustainability, Food For Thought will be examining our attitudes toward food, asking where our food comes from and how it\u0027s produced, because there are plenty of forces and special interests at work that would rather you not ask too many questions -- at great cost to our environment, our health, and the planet.Comments (105)Rachel M. MartinWriter, Findingjoy.netMotherhood is a brave journey. It\u0027s always been this brave thing to raise another independent, pushing the limits, melt your heart at night, love them forever even when they drive you crazy, human. That\u0027s what you\u0027re doing. Even on those tired days.Comments (55)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027To figure out whether economics education can shift people in the selfish direction, we need to track beliefs and behaviors over time -- or randomly assign them to economics exposure. Here\u0027s what the evidence shows.Comments (200)Sen. Barbara BoxerU.S. Senator from California; Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeHow much more pain and uncertainty do Americans have to endure before Congress decides that it should pay the bills it has racked up? Businesses and families must always pay their bills and so must Congress.Comments (233)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The problem is that the Democrats still seem to accept the Republicans\u0027 parameters for the budget debate. The implication is that current deficits are a serious problem.Comments (123)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI playfully asked Joshua Dubois what Biblical figure President Obama most closely resembled, giving him the choice of the Holy Spirit, Jesus or God.CommentsJesse Lava and Sarah SolonThe country\u0027s biggest for-profit prison companies already pull in hundreds of millions of dollars a year locking up immigrants in federal custody.

The family photo of her toned body with her three children asks, \"What\u0027s your excuse?\" Because she asked, I\u0027m happy to answer.Comments (18)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Although the $13 billion fine on the civil charges, which includes $4 billion in direct assistance to swindled homeowners, mostly in depressed inner city neighborhoods, is to be applauded, it represents about half of the profit JPMorgan garnered last year.Comments (75)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comWashington\u0027s military plans and tactics since 9/11 have been a spectacular train wreck. But lessons learned from the collapse of war policy? Don\u0027t count on it.Comments (20)Rep. Mike HondaU.S. Representative for California\u0027s 17th DistrictIt\u0027s time to eliminate the legal authority of a single House of Congress to destroy the full faith and credit of the United States. The recent crisis shows that Tea Party Republicans continue to view the debt limit as a negotiating lever to extract political concessions each time our bills come due.CommentsDylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowThe tension in the United States in palpable. The feeling derives from the ever-increasing awareness that a tiny group of wealthy individuals have a hammerlock on our political system that prevents new ways of approaching education, agriculture, health, energy, banking or climate change.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 9111. Online shopping: In addition to being a potential money pit, online shopping on a public Internet connection might allow a fellow traveler to invade your cyber space and turn your laptop into a transmitter of personally identifying information.CommentsEric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIsn\u0027t there a strong argument to be made that, by staring down the radicals inside the Republican Party who closed the government down in search of political ransom, Obama unequivocally led? And that he led on behalf of the majority of Americans who disapproved of the shutdown?Comments (19)Aysha Akhtar, M.D., M.P.H.Neurologist, public health specialist, author \"Animals and Public Health. Why Treating Animals Better is Critical for Human Welfare\"The NFL continues to fund misleading head injury studies on animals that will not get the league closer to identifying the precise causes of brain trauma in football players and how to prevent and treat it.CommentsSean McElweeWriterThere is certainly a strategic reason for Democrats to play down Clinton: three more years under press scrutiny will only make her less appealing. But there are other reasons to question whether America needs another Clinton presidency.Comments (45)Joan BladesCo-Founder, MoveOn.orgHer story details her experiences going to interview for jobs and having potential employers ask if she was married and if she had kids. As soon as prospective employers heard she wasn\u0027t married and had kids, they were not interested in learning any more about her.CommentsJoanna ZelmanFront page editor, The Huffington PostThe music started again -da dah- he stepped forward and I stepped back -dah da dah.

GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans can pummel their own party if they want to, but what\u0027s amazing is that 18 of them in the Senate and 144 in the House voted against restoring government services and paying America\u0027s debts.Comments (502)Human Rights WatchDefending human rights world wideDeaf children have a right to a quality education, like all other children, in a language and environment that maximizes their potential.Comments (20)Kristin HackmanBloggerWho am I to argue against the romance of \"When a child is born, a mother is born?\" I get it.
