{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressLast week, as House Republicans debated whether or not they would take the debt ceiling hostage in yet another round of flirt-with-default nonsense, we noted three fairly inexorable facts about these stunts. First, as a tactic, the default-bluff in exchange for concessions has a diminishing utility -- you can only back down from a bluff so many times before no one believes you! Second, the move has proven to be politically costly to the GOP (though, let\u0027s note that costs have been too short-lived for Democrats to exploit). And third, the White House will definitely reject any demand, anyway, unless everyone there goes temporarily insane.Comments (76)Ari EmanuelCEO, William Morris Endeavor EntertainmentI\u0027m not saying that I\u0027ve struck the perfect balance, but I do believe that it\u0027s important to strive for your own version of it. Like anything worthwhile, it takes discipline and practice, but defining your life beyond career success is actually good for business.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowConsidering how Bill O\u0027Reilly merely pandered to the delusional obsessions of his viewers rather than using his time to ask questions of actual substance, I thought I\u0027d suggest some additional questions O\u0027Reilly could\u0027ve asked the president -- I mean, as long as he\u0027s asking stupid questions anyway.Comments (28)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorToday is the fifteenth anniversary of my living clean and sober, free from the grips of a long, secret prescription painkiller and alcohol addiction. I went to sleep last night imagining the grief of the family, children, friends, colleagues and fans of Mr. Hoffman. His gifts, so powerful, his demons, more so.Comments (50)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkLet us quit playing ourselves: employers are not fighting this struggle so that they can hire more people. They want to maximize profits, bottom line.Comments (22)Bianca BoskerExecutive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostIn honor of Facebook\u0027s 10th anniversary Tuesday, which falls just a few months before my own 10th Facebook anniversary, I went rooting through the decade\u0027s worth of stuff I\u0027ve forked over to Mark Zuckerberg and co. Huge mistake.Comments (31)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistDespite what we might be hearing in industry spin, the environmental report released by the State Department Friday confirms that tar sands crude means a dirtier, more dangerous future for our children, all so that the oil industry can reach the higher prices of overseas markets.Comments (219)Paula BrayLives in Kalama, WAThis is America today. We have no running water; we use a hose to fill jugs. At night, in my bed, when it\u0027s cold out, my blanket can freeze to the wall of the RV. I have a Master\u0027s degree and have been in the workforce for over 30 years. By the end of this month, we will be without anywhere to turn.Comments (240)LeVar BurtonActor, Director, Co-founder of Reading RainbowMother Nature, the power of a nascent storytelling art form in the televised mini-series, and a nation largely ignorant of and reluctant to come to terms with the horrors of its slave-owning past conspired to create a \u0027perfect storm\u0027 of enlightenment in America.CommentsBrian DooleyDirector, Human Rights First\u0027s Human Rights Defenders ProgramSince the military-backed government ousted the elected civilian president Morsi in a coup in July, journalists and film makers have become particular targets.CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThat popular legend is misleading. Parks\u0027 defiance of Montgomery\u0027s segregation laws was not an isolated incident. It was part of a lifelong crusade to dismantle Jim Crow.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Remember the story about how the aging of the baby boomers will bankrupt us because we will have too few workers to support the surge of retired baby boomers? Now we are supposed to be worried that we won\u0027t have any work for people to do because the robots will be there to do it faster and cheaper. Either of these stories could in principle be true, but they cannot both be true.Comments (43)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Herein lies the tragic, indeed fatal, flaw of the State Department review. The State Department Environmental Impact Statement doesn\u0027t even ask the right question: How do the unconventional Canadian oil sands fit or not fit within the overall carbon budget?Comments (355)Cenk UygurHost, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027If MSNBC cared about not presenting liberals as sniveling cowards, they would never go through these debasing apologies one after another. But they don\u0027t care about that because the guy who runs the network doesn\u0027t give a damn about how progressives look, because he isn\u0027t one of them.Comments (231)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersLast week JPMorgan Chase\u0027s Board approved a 74 percent pay raise for its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for 2013. Sometimes we get numb to numbers like $20 million. To put it in perspective, in 2013, Dimon made $9,615 per hour. In other words, he made more in the first two hours of the first workday of the year than a minimum-wage worker made all year long.Comments (71)Nicole WildeAuthor, Canine Behavior SpecialistWe\u0027ve all heard about dogs who guard their food, or perhaps treats or toys. But there are some dogs from whom resource guarding goes beyond the norm, and seems to be an art form.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027For the Democratic hawks, Afghanistan was going to be the good war, but Obama has learned, as did then-President Jimmy Carter more than 30 years ago, that the Afghans are not to be toyed with.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCelebrities who go in and out of rehab may be struggling privately, but the message the public receives in those cases -- enough details to know that a celebrity is back in a program, but not enough to know why -- is too often that rehab is a place to go whenever you feel the need to get away for a bit.Comments (20)Peter Alexander MeyersPolitical theorist and author of \u0027Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\u0027It takes rare fortune and fortitude to live, really and richly, in the full span of one\u0027s life. Especially if it reaches to a century. From youth to nearly his last breath, Pete Seeger was flat out alive. What did his life show? This simple truth: no one lives alone.CommentsNeal SamudreWriter, Author, Speaker, Difference MakerMaybe, we\u0027re against getting engaged at an early age because we believe the wrong things about love. Call me a rebel, but I don\u0027t think love is dependent on my age.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe Justice Department charged Snowden with three counts of violating the Espionage Act, which carries prison sentences of 10 years each. Professor Smith discusses how Snowden\u0027s acts may be regarded in the future.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe U.S. markets opened with a rebound today after yesterday\u0027s selloff, so go figure. Like I said, who knows why indexes bump and grind on a daily and intra-daily basis? But these larger issues are very much worth keeping a close eye upon.CommentsJocelyn GianniniAd rep, Harper\u0027s MagazineShe simply what she saw, a beautiful woman, and was moved to speak up. And the more time I spend trying to reconcile her vision with my own narrative, the less time I have for the elliptical and bacon cheeseburgers (because there is time for both).CommentsSec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesWithout the opportunity to live a healthy life, there is no opportunity to live the American dream or participate fully in our communities. Without the security of health insurance, there is no economic security for middle-class families, and for so many other families working their way into the middle class.CommentsBarbara GarsonAuthor, \u0027Down the Up Escalator: How the 99% Live in the Great Recession\u0027If it was hard for underwater homeowners to distinguish between bankers and bureaucrats while they were losing their homes, it will be even harder for frustrated sick people to untangle the public and private strands so tightly braided into the Affordable Care Act.CommentsJohn ThompsonAward-winning historian and inner-city teacherThe reform public relations spin machine has struggled recently as more families reject top-down micromanaging of their children\u0027s schools. Common Core standards were originally sold as a corrective to the rote instruction encouraged by NCLB. Now Common Core is promising \"tests worth teaching to.\"Comments (27)Lara FriedmanDirector of Policy and Government Relations, Americans for Peace NowThere is no such thing as benevolent occupation. Occupation is bad for Israel, bad for the Palestinians, and antithetical to Israel\u0027s survival as a democracy and Jewish state.CommentsGary A. OlsonPresident, Daemen CollegeA major challenge for higher education in the years to come will be to ensure that logic, critical thinking, close reading, the scientific method, and the spirit of inquiry in general don\u0027t become lost arts -- lost to the imperative of opinion.CommentsMegan SmolenyakGenealogy Expert, Author of \"Hey, America, Your Roots Are Showing\" \u0026 \"Who Do You Think You Are?\"Were Bruno Mars to go on a world tour for the release of Unorthodox Jukebox, there would likely be unsuspecting cousins in the audiences in Madrid, New York, Kiev, San Juan, Manila and Budapest. So tell me: Which box do you think Bruno Mars ticked on the 2010 census?Comments (22)Christine BaderAuthor, forthcoming \"The Evolution of a Corporate Idealist: When Girl Meets Oil\"Of course, the international community -- companies included -- should be fighting for equal rights for all. But before urging companies to turn their attention outwards and lobby host governments, we should seek evidence that they are addressing the risks to human rights in their own operations.CommentsAdam J. RoseHuffPost senior editorSeattle didn\u0027t win the Super Bowl just because Pete Carroll is a fun guy. If you want to know how the Seahawks became the NFL\u0027s best, you have to look at how their management went back to school.CommentsLisa Guest, 2014. 4.02Monica Swanson, 2014. 4.02Adam Rutkowski, 2014. 4.02Dan Solin, 2014. 4.02Jeffrey M Cohn, 2014. 4.02Nicole Wilde, 2014. 4.02Rupa Mehta, 2014. 4.02Edward Goldman, 2014. 4.02Evan Gottlieb, 2014. 4.02Scholastic Parent and Child, 2014. 4.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"GOLD FOR GALL",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
