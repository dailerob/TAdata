{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranPresident Obama has a lot of issues to weigh with regards to Afghanistan, but I really hope he sides with the American troops on the ground. They\u0027re now being asked by our government to provide security to a population in a mission that is no longer wanted by the democratically elected leader of that country, making their current mission untenable and unproductive. Therefore, the only conclusion he can come to is to engage U.S. forces in a mission that can be successful. And that is an immediate transition to an Advise, Train, and Assist role, on the way towards a negotiated counter-terror mission with a very limited footprint.Read Post | Comments (68)Robert Reich, 03/15/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027The rise in gas prices has almost nothing to do with energy policy. It has everything to do with America\u0027s continuing failure to adequately regulate Wall Street. But don\u0027t hold your breath waiting for Republicans to tell the truth.Read Post | Comments (33)James Kwak, 03/15/12Associate professor, University of Connecticut School of Law, and co-author, White House BurningThomas Friedman\u0027s fetishizing of balance as an end in itself, in order to brand himself as a reasonable centrist who wishes we could all get along, is not going to get us there.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 03/14/12As the seemingly endless GOP nomination fight grinds on, it\u0027s becoming clearer who President Obama\u0027s most formidable opponent is likely to be: himself.Read Post | Comments (3,465)Marlo Thomas, 03/15/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistWe live on the park in New York where there seems to be a parade at least a few times a month for every possible nationality there is. One of the biggest is St. Patrick\u0027s Day, which of course thrills my husband. There\u0027s nobody named Donahue who doesn\u0027t love a St. Patrick\u0027s Day parade.Read Post | Comments (16)William Brown, 03/15/12Student, Rutgers-Camden School of LawThere is no doubt that Governor Chris Christie publicly humiliated me. But on the positive side, for a few days, the whole nation learned about the pleas of the small Rutgers campus in Camden, New Jersey.Read Post | CommentsDavid Berri, 03/15/12Co-author, \u0027Stumbling on Wins\u0027; Economics professor, Southern Utah UniversityNext time you hear an \"expert\" tell you how good a player is because he averages so many points per game, ask yourself: Is this because that player just \"takes\" shots from his teammates? Or is this because that player gets his shots to go in the basket?Read Post | CommentsJeffrey Goldberg, 03/15/12National Correspondent, The AtlanticGeorge W. Bush was, in his own way, a philo-Semite, but he never would have made such a member-of-the-tribe kind of joke as Barack Obama did when I recently handed him a copy of the New American Haggadah.Read Post | Comments (316)Wray Herbert, 03/15/12Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027We\u0027re all bombarded by information these days, unless we take deliberate steps to avoid it. Do we feel and act differently as a result of all this rapid-fire stimulation? Is it detrimental? Psychological scientists are very interested in this question.Read Post | CommentsBarbara Ehrenreich, 03/15/12New York Times bestselling authorBy the Reagan era, the \"culture of poverty\" had become a cornerstone of conservative ideology: poverty was caused, not by low wages or a lack of jobs, but by bad attitudes and faulty lifestyles.Read Post | Comments (439)Mitchell Bard, 03/15/12Writer and FilmmakerWhat happens next is up to the Afghan people, not us. The country\u0027s president has asked us to leave. If he doesn\u0027t want us there, we shouldn\u0027t be there. In fact, we should beat Karzai\u0027s timetable and get most of our troops out of Afghanistan as soon as is safe and practical.Read Post | Comments (32)Mari Fagel, 03/15/12Your Legal LadyNow, when a politician is running for election it makes sense to list off your own accomplishments while in office. Yet speaking about free mammograms in one sentence and how much he\u0027ll miss his family in another just seemed bizarre.Read Post | CommentsAngelina Chapin, 03/15/12Blogs Editor, HuffPost CanadaWhen I saw the pictures of a makeup-less Faith Hill going viral this week, that high school girl in me cringed. Making fun of somebody\u0027s natural face is as sinister as making fun of the kid with acne. That is to say, it is a mean, childish, bully tactic.Read Post | Comments (17)Christine Carter, PhD, 03/15/12Sociologist, parent educator and author, \u0027Raising Happiness\u0027Is it usually better for kids to have unhappily married parents who stay together? Or are there some cases where divorce is actually better for kids than remaining married?Read Post | Comments (89)Andrew Nagorski, 03/15/12Vice president/Director of public policy at the EastWest InstituteBerlin underwent an explosion of creativity in the arts and sciences even as it reeled from the consequences of Germany\u0027s defeat. It was precisely this chaos, creativity and excitement of the German capital that served as a magnet for many Americans, including numerous celebrities.Read Post | CommentsMary Nguyen, 03/15/12Graduate Student, Johns Hopkins UniversityThe increased attention to student debt also has brought about misconceptions that are neither helpful nor productive.

You\u0027re mad about corruption in your country -- with hundreds of millions of dollars meant to aid people in poverty being siphoned off by greedy officials.
