{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWe\u0027re beyond balance in educational credentials. Men and women are being recruited for management positions in equal numbers. Some 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies have women\u0027s affinity groups -- and by all accounts they are doing a good job in connecting women, highlighting issues and sweeping old debris off the path to female progress. Yet, the Forbes Insight Study found that 24 percent of senior leadership positions are filled by women, up 3 percent from last year. A Grant Thornton study put it lower -- 17 percent and a place for the U.S. in the bottom ten of all countries. The numbers lead to the big question: If 50 percent of the American workforce is female, why isn\u0027t that reflected at the top? The follow up questions are: Should it be? Will it ever be?Comments (89)Neil HarbissonArtistI don\u0027t feel that I\u0027m using technology, I don\u0027t feel that I\u0027m wearing technology, I feel that I am technology. I don\u0027t perceive my antenna as a device, I perceive it as a part of my body, I perceive it as an organ.Comments (34)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowUltimately, if we\u0027re going to engage in a debate about the NSA, certain people need to calm down and very carefully read everything that drops. It\u0027s a complicated issue that demands an even-keel and a clear understanding of what\u0027s being reported.Comments (189)Jason WhitlockColumnist, FOXSports.comHere\u0027s what the race-baiters on the right fail to comprehend: There\u0027s a clear-cut, easy-to-follow blueprint for avoiding the ravages of black-on-black violence and crime. America has yet to provide us a comparable blueprint for avoiding racial profiling.Comments (367)Keli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comIn this age of 24-7 paparazzi shots, most high profile new mothers hide out until they get their figures back into photo ready mode. But Middleton didn\u0027t do that, instead showing what a real mother\u0027s body looks like immediately after birth.Comments (134)William K. BlackAssoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleIt is obscene that Holder promised not to torture Snowden, but the underlying obscenity is that the United States did torture suspects and Holder has refused to prosecute those who ordered and conducted the torture.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOEurope\u0027s incomplete anniversary speaks to a broader phenomenon that serially frustrates the global economy from recovering fully from the shock of the 2008 global financial crisis: Politicians have failed to exploit the window offered by experimental central bank policies, and continue to do so.CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, against the backdrop of the Trayvon Martin case, the decision weakening the Voting Rights Act, and Detroit\u0027s bankruptcy, Howard Fineman looks at how far we still are from true equality for African-Americans.Comments (33)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe gun lobby has been enriching gun manufacturers at the expense of our children\u0027s safety for far too long. For years the National Rifle Association has blocked the truth and actively fought against the passage and enforcement of gun safety laws.CommentsJill HerzigEditor in Chief, RedbookHow did we get to this ridiculous place, where losing the baby weight is a competitive sport followed by millions?Comments (40)Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceFund managers that invested with SAC must be quaking in their Guccis. Investors expected them to perform first-class due diligence before placing funds under Cohen\u0027s management. Yet serious questions have swirled around Cohen\u0027s trading practices for more than a decade.CommentsLarry StraussVeteran high school teacher and coach, writerI\u0027d never imagined blues like that -- upbeat and exquisite. It seemed somehow to give a nod to all of life\u0027s sadness without giving in to any of it.CommentsKevin WuYouTube Comedian, KevJumbaThe students in Nairobi had been learning English by watching my YouTube videos. Incredible. I accepted the challenge and two months later I was on a plane to Kenya to teach a class of 5th graders in Nairobi.CommentsRosabeth Moss KanterProfessor, Harvard Business SchoolHuman nature allows us to think our way out of blindspots. Tribalism is muted by other human creations, such as diverse communities with complex structures and more universalistic values. We call that civilization.CommentsShannon Bradley-CollearyAging vaintress, wife dominatrix, mom butler and humble author who is slightly mustachioedWe fell into empathy with each other. Our similar sadness cancelled out the differences in our backgrounds and temperaments -- and we had the ability to make each other laugh until we peed our pants.Comments (16)Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027President Obama and Press Secretary Carney are insensitive and wrong about the scandals. The scandals are not phony. They are real. If you want to talk phony, maybe these two gentlemen should check the mirror?Comments (96)Suzan Haskins and Dan PrescherInternationalLiving.com EditorsThinking about retiring overseas but concerned you might make a less-than-worthy choice because you can\u0027t afford to visit all the places on your wish list before you make your final decision?CommentsMohammed FairouzComposerFor me, pitches, tones and keys are more than just about sympathetic vibrations, open strings and other technicalities of physics and orchestration. A pitch suggests a color and an atmosphere.CommentsMichael F. JacobsonExecutive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestThe ingredient in question is carmine. It\u0027s a red dye extracted from the dried, pulverized bodies of the cochineal insect -- an unphotogenic arthropod native to Mexico and South America with a fondness for cactus. Dannon uses carmine in four flavors of Fruit on the Bottom yogurt.Comments (153)Laura FinkFounder, Fink \u0026 Hernandez Consulting, LLCMayor Bob Filner has admitted that he has \"failed to fully respect women\" and to having a \"monster\" inside him. He is facing lurid allegations of sexual harassment and possibly assault. Filner harassed me in 2005, when I was serving as his Deputy Campaign Manager.Comments (82)Rebecca WaltonFreelancer writer, agoraphobe, mental health awareness campaignerAfter talking with a fellow agoraphobic (James) on Twitter, we came up with an idea that would push this awareness even further. What if everyone could have their stories heard and shared? What if they could all receive that positivity? We wanted to create a Diaries of a Broken Mind style campaign but on a much grander scale.CommentsRep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkNovember 30, 1950, was a living nightmare. In the battle of Kunu-ri, more than 5,000 American soldiers were killed, wounded or taken as prisoners of war. Ninety percent of my unit was killed. Little did I know, back then, that we were stopping communism.CommentsBlake PageSpecial Assistant to the President, Military Religious Freedom Foundation\"Lack or loss of spiritual faith\" is included in a list of risk indicators for use by \"leaders at all levels\" to \"identify and address risky behavior or events that may lead to risky behavior, as soon as possible.\"Comments (380)Edward DorsonUnderwater photographer, ocean activist and authorDeplorably, all recent U.S. state and territorial gains in shark conservation are now on the chopping block.CommentsChantal Sicile-KiraAuthor, \u0027A Full Life With Autism\u0027; Founder, AutismCollege.comOne morning Jeremy woke up with a big grin on his face.

Everywhere I went, I was white men\u0027s object (emphasis on object) of desire. I was being objectified, exoticized and sexualized for being one of few coloured girls in a sea of white men. Until I regain my trust in white men, I\u0027ve saved myself from being checked off someone\u0027s \"To Do\" list again.Comments (979)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistOur country\u0027s whole existence is based on the desire to break away from the throne. Yet we\u0027re always looking for our own royalty. We like to talk about our dynasties (the Bushes) and our royal family of Camelot (the Kennedys). It\u0027s clear that, for all the revolutionary blood that was shed, we are in a perpetual state of Royal Envy.Comments (17)Julianna W. Minerwww.rantsfrommommyland.comIt hit me like a ton of bricks last week. I was at the community pool, looking around to see what my kids were up to. Then I really looked at them. As I sat there drinking lukewarm coffee, I realized, Oh my God.
