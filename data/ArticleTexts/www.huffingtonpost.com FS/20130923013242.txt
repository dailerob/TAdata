{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week began with another mass shooting -- the 16th since Newtown in December. As the president presides over yet another grim memorial service, it\u0027s time for an honest assessment of what is really happening in our culture. Yes, we need better background checks and mental health screening, but we need to also look deeper -- at the root causes that lead to nearly 32,000 gun deaths a year, and over 1 million Americans taking part in gang activities. Matthew Dowd defined \"the real core problem\" as \"poverty of the soul.\" And fixing it will require more compassion, less division and the recognition that our common humanity is greater than our differences. On Thursday, Pope Francis took a step in that direction, faulting the Catholic Church for being \"obsessed\" with gays and abortion at the expense of the larger mission. \"We must always consider the person,\" he said. Our well-being as a nation depends on it.Comments (187)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhat is it going to take for us to stand up and say enough to this internal gun war of American against American? What is it going to take to create a mental health system that prevents such tragedies from happening over and over?Comments (843)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Our job, as people of faith, is to protect the poor and to make it politically unsafe for politicians to go after them -- to pick on the poor. So we will be watching who votes against feeding the hungry this week,Comments (1,877)Pam OmidyarFounder and board chair, Humanity UnitedTwo years after Sudan split, the important central border region of Abyei remains contested between the governments and communities of a divided Sudan and a newly independent South Sudan.CommentsElizabeth DrewJournalistOnly the members of the electorate can restore the institutions and procedures that make our democratic system work, starting with the next chance they get.Comments (404)Arianna HuffingtonAs the UN General Assembly begins a new session and leaders from all over the world come together to tackle our biggest problems, we\u0027re starting conversations at HuffPost on a handful of big initiatives that focus on ways to improve people\u0027s lives in the developing world.Comments (27)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostPope Francis continues to radically refocus the Catholic Church and, even as a non-Catholic, I am beginning to view him as a personal pastor.Comments (791)Linda BergtholdHealth policy researcherAs the country prepares for open enrollment October 1st in the insurance exchanges of the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), a small group of dedicated artists and politicians in Pennsylvania have been working toward a broader solution.Comments (1,346)Gavin NewsomLieutenant Governor of CaliforniaHow many people have to die before we realize that the only thing the truly stops a bad guy is not letting them get their hands on a gun in the first place?Comments (1,782)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarExcessive violence in films and on TV has been joined by excessive sex, much of it acted out according to porn-established norms. Even if much of this is artistic commentary, without discussion, kids begin to believe this is how sex really works.Comments (224)Willie NelsonPresident of Farm AidToday, as the minutes tick down to another farm bill deadline, people in towns and cities everywhere are taking matters into their own hands. They\u0027re standing up with family farmers and insisting on food that is best for them and their families.Comments (786)Dan PallottaAuthor of \"Uncharitable\"Could it be that everything we\u0027ve been taught about charity, and about giving, and about change is backwards? Is it possible that in the name of an ethic we are actually prolonging the suffering of millions of adults and children the world over?Comments (519)Gina McCarthyAdministrator, U.S.Environmental Protection AgencyToday, the auto industry is thriving, and American consumers save about $8 thousand at the pump over the life of their vehicle. We can\u0027t solve climate change overnight -- but we can get closer to a solution.Comments (557)Eric ReevesProfessor at Smith CollegeTo suggest that the terrors of children in Darfur, their pain and agony, as well as their deaths are any less \"morally obscene\" than gas attacks on children in Syria is a painfully invidious comparison -- the more so since in the end, it is politically expedient.Comments (156)Asha RangappaAssociate Dean, Yale Law SchoolThe pushback is heartening and well-intentioned, but misses what ought to be the real shame target: India. After all, despite being a country of almost a billion people, India has left it to America to crown the first Indian beauty queen who looks... well, Indian.Comments (692)Jason KirellCombat veteran, former reporter and bloggerI didn\u0027t risk my life in Afghanistan so I could come back and watch people go hungry in America. I certainly didn\u0027t risk it so I could come back and go hungry. Anyone who genuinely supports cutting food stamps is not an intellectual or an ideologue -- they\u0027re a bully.Comments (2,490)Josh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceWhen individuals like Aaron Alexis are not prohibited purchasers under existing federal law, it is obvious that universal background checks alone are not enough. We need to have a national discussion about expanding the disqualifying criteria.Comments (808)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistMy friend Paul recently called me weeping. Broken leg? No. Death in the family? Nuh-uh. Cheating spouse? Nope. What my teary friend was suffering from was a sudden outbreak of empty nest syndrome. \"I just got back from dropping my kid off at college in the Midwest,\" he sniffed. \"I\u0027m a mess!\"Comments (35)Dan FroomkinExecutive Editor, FearlessMedia.orgThe important thing about this vote to anyone paying any attention at all was the subtext -- what it really meant. But the coverage was stenographic and context-deficient.Comments (486)Kelly MacLeanStand up comic, actress, writer @thekellymacleanShe rings me up for $313. I resist the urge to unwrap and swallow whole another $6 truffle in protest. Barely. Instead, I reach for my wallet, flash her a quiet smile and say, \"Namaste.\"Comments (2,589)Mark WahlbergActor, Producer and PhilanthropistMost high school dropouts don\u0027t end up with successful careers in Hollywood. I was lucky. Compared with high school graduates, dropouts are more likely to be unemployed, in poor health, living in poverty or on public assistance.Comments (116)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThis week should remove any doubt about whether markets are highly dependent on the Fed. They sure are. Indeed, you could not have constructed better conditions for a controlled experiment. Yet, ironically, the medium-term investment stakes are now higher.Comments (152)Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027On the second anniversary of that day in lower Manhattan when people first sat down in outrage and then stayed in dedication and solidarity and hope, remember them, remember how unpredictably the world changes, remember to hope, remember to build.Comments (25)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolSay goodnight to the dream that education, journalism, scientific evidence, media literacy or reason can provide the tools and information that people need in order to make good decisions. It turns out that in the public realm, a lack of information isn\u0027t the real problem.Comments (608)Jamie BruesehoffBlogger, \u0027I Am Totally *That* Mom\u0027I know it\u0027s hard, but thank you for what you do when you bring your children to church. Please know that your family -- with all of its noise, struggle, commotion, and joy -- are not simply tolerated, you are a vital part of the community gathered in worship.Comments (2,511)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistTar sands oil is exactly the type of dirty oil we can no longer afford. It may be great for oil companies, but it is killing our planet. There is no energy security in that.Comments (481)Ellen SeidmanBlogger, Love That MaxConsidering parents of kids with special needs to be saints overestimates us, and underestimates our children.Comments (137)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureForget the debt ceiling for a moment, if you can. Forget the GOP\u0027s attempt to shut down the government over the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to explain to the American people how profoundly misguided, and even immoral, the Republicans\u0027 entire economic agenda has become?Comments (963)Jamie WhiteBlogger, dog loverHow do I know who you are? Because the people at Animal Control gave me Cocoa\u0027s intake sheet. You know, the one you filled out. The one that said Cocoa was 12 years old and you\u0027d had her all those years. I just couldn\u0027t understand why someone would dump a family member.Comments (1,338)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs gridlock shifts into overdrive and the self-inflicting wound squad are sharpening their knives, here\u0027s my abbreviated take: It\u0027s all about Boehner.Comments (237)Alicia BayerBlogger, A Magical ChildhoodWe are such a competitive culture that even our preschoolers have become trophies and bragging rights. Childhood shouldn\u0027t be a race.Comments (158)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.22.09Jim Moret, 2013.22.09Peter Dreier, 2013.22.09David Briggs, 2013.22.09Dr. Rock Positano, 2013.22.09Ernest Drucker, 2013.22.09Andrew Reinbach, 2013.22.09Cadell Last, 2013.22.09Pauline Gaines, 2013.22.09Yoani Sanchez, 2013.22.09Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"AND THE EMMY GOES TO...",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechnologyYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
