{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaTGIF. Time for our weekly preview of the guest list for this Sunday\u0027s Meet the Press, where we offer up the hard-hitting questions we’d like to hear from our jowly host. According to the MTP website, this week’s show will feature Sen. Joe Biden and Rep. Curt Weldon discussing \"Iraq, Iran, and U.S. Intelligence... What is the outlook in Iraq as the causalities and the insurgency continue?\" Sounds promising... good to see Iraq at the top of the menu, and the acknowledgement (at least by the website writer) that the body count continues to rise.Following Biden and Weldon will be a MTP roundtable where David Broder, Gwen Ifill, John Harwood, and Judy Woodruff will \"share their insights and analysis on President Bush\u0027s second term, Howard Dean\u0027s chairmanship of the DNC, and the early forecast for the 2008 elections\". So here’s what I’d love to hear Russert ask the panel: \"Can you believe we’re actually going to waste valuable and precious air time talking about something as ludicrous as early forecasts for 2008? Yet that is exactly what we are going to do: natter on mindlessly about something that is over 3 years away. Isn\u0027t baseless tea leaf reading and horse-race speculation so much more fun than talking about real news?\"Read More06.10.2005 Hooman MajdAn Iranian would only make the claim that Iran is supporting a Sunni insurgency to someone he knows is ignorant of the scale of Shia-Sunni enmity; apparently a gullible congressman will do fine.read whole post | permalink | comments06.09.2005 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.In the past four years the White House has altered, suppressed, or attempted to discredit close to a dozen major reports on global warming. My prediction: the emasculated stenographers who make up the White House press corps will ignore this latest outrage as they have prior Bush White House deceptions on critical public policy issues ranging from global warming, to the budget deficit, Medicaid and the war in Iraq.read whole post | permalink06.10.2005 Christie HefnerDr. Mardge Cohen has done something miraculous by establishing a women\u0027s HIV clinic in Rwanda, working with a number of Rwandan women\u0027s groups and the Ministry of Public Health. What makes this work especially powerful to me, is that the women being provided care are those who were infected by rape during the genocide ten years ago. We in the U.S. and Europe turned our backs on Rwanda then -- we must not let it happen again.read whole post | permalink06.09.2005 Jann WennerKarl Rove, Ken Mehlman, and Tom DeLay don’t even have to bother attacking Howard Dean anymore; their work is being done for them by the stalwarts of what’s left of the Democratic Party establishment. Dean says that the Republicans are essentially a party that is by, for, and of the white Christians -- which we all know is fundamentally true -- and all of a sudden we have Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi chiding him. Our guys are doing the work of the so-called GOP Echo Machine.read whole post | permalink | comments06.10.2005 Danielle Crittenden“Where’d you get your mullet?” Red Staters like receiving compliments from their politicians so long as they do not suspect they are being condescended to: saying “I like your mullet (or tattoo or new pick-up)” is less effective than asking where they got it, which implies you want one just like it...read whole post | permalink | comments06.09.2005 Jonathan AlterMany of the people at Fox are fine journalists and executives. But whomever was assigned to spread the \"dirt\" on me must have noticed that, while disclaimers are often appropriate, in the middle of a satirical piece it would have been unnecessary and ridiculous. They were just trying to shiv someone who had the temerity to make fun of their boss.read whole post | permalink | comments06.09.2005 Rep. Ellen TauscherOfficials at the Pentagon tell us that the U.S. is well on its way to training up enough Iraqi forces to replace our troops, or offer tragically misguided lines like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers, who last April called the spike in violence a \"symptom of the success that we\u0027re having here.\" Compare that to a recent assessment of Iraqi forces, which found that out of 81 Iraqi Army battalions, only three were considered ready to conduct independent operations.read whole post | permalink | comments06.09.2005 Bree WalkerWe are about to watch a President veto what just might be the most productive scientific health care breakthrough the world has ever seen. That he can bring himself to do this in the face of present-day potentials is mindboggling. That he can bring himself to do it in the face of what just might be possible in the future is somewhere beyond that. That he does it in the name of fundamentalist moral values which represent the views only of a distinct minority in this country is one more indicator of the need for the existing majority to coalesce and make its presence felt.read whole post | permalink06.10.2005 John DickerDon’t ask why I was on the Parents Television Council’s website.

I ask because the House GOP has started a push to repeal that limit.

Jim McDermottGiven the level of defense spending, it\u0027s fair to say that the United States has a few (thousand) military fighter jets parked on tarmacs around the world. Let\u0027s do something useful with them. Let\u0027s do something humanitarian with them.

That people actually have to TRANSLATE what is being said for them? What kind of crap is THAT? I say that if Bolton comes around to your office and you can\u0027t hold a five-minute conversation with him about what bad shape the UN is in and what a waste of time you are for being there, then he has the right to toss your other-language-speaking butt out onto the street. And he’ll do it too.read whole post | permalink | comments06.09.2005 Thomas de ZengotitaYou just can\u0027t cover every lie they tell. Sometimes I think they tell so many just to neutralize coverage of any one of them. But this Cooney story seems like such a simple containable case in point. How did this actually happen? What were the specific day-to-day mechanics? Maybe this is the one that\u0027s worth knowing about, in detail, as an exemplar?read whole post | permalink06.09.2005 Jamie CourtCongressman Chris Cox, President Bush\u0027s pick to lead the Securities Exchange Commission, helped cover up one of the nation\u0027s biggest investment fraud while a private attorney. If the Democrats in US Senate have any fight left, they will reject Congressman Chris Cox\u0027s appointment as SEC chief based on Cox\u0027s representation of swindler William C. Cooper and his company First Pension Corp, which took investors for over $130 million.read whole post | permalink06.09.2005 Jim LampleyAs for my insufferable egomania, I\u0027m reminded of a line from Bob Dylan\u0027s \"Visions of Johanna\": \"show me someone who\u0027s not a parasite, and I\u0027ll go out and say a prayer for him\". If my ego\u0027s insufferable, I regret that, but if you are going to make strong statements in public, and I do, it\u0027s useful to have some self-approval. After all, you\u0027re going to run into some Phil Mushnicks along the way.read whole post | permalink | comments06.09.2005 Cenk UygurI was asked to write something about Michael Jackson. Also, since the verdict is coming up, we’ll probably be talking about it on our show. So, last night I was trying to figure out what I thought about the Michael Jackson case.

On average, jobs leaving America pay $22,457 more than the jobs being created. Tell that to your kid. We are in the midst of the most massive transformation of our economy in history, and there is no road map.
