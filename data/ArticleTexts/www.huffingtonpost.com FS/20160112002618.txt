{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaThe only thing that will loosen the NRA\u0027s grip on Congress and state capitols are leaders who are unafraid to act in the interest of public safety and support stronger gun laws. Our most powerful weapon is to create a voting base of even greater size and influence that will vote on a single issue: gun sense. In fact, this past November, a little-known candidate for Virginia state senate -- Jeremy McPike -- pulled out a victory over an NRA-endorsed candidate, right in the gun lobby\u0027s backyard. The best part: He ran on a gun sense platform. Three years ago, a victory like this would have been completely out of reach. But with a grassroots movement of moms, survivors and supporters who are just as passionate about preventing gun violence as our opponents are about preserving gun rights, more victories like this are imminent.David Bowie did not die. Don\u0027t believe what you\u0027ve heard. Kill the messenger. Burn the newspapers and magazines. Yell out your window. David Bowie is alive. So alive, and he will live forever.Actor, comedian and best-selling authorWe need leaders willing to call out the corruption of our criminal justice system and clean it top-to-bottom. It\u0027s time to step up and become the leaders we\u0027ve been waiting for. It\u0027s time we stopped demanding justice from others and started creating it for ourselves. Who\u0027s with me?Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerWriter and Program Coordinator, Forward TogetherI am a teacher. In an age riddled by the political and corporate takeover and decimation of education, an age in which data collection and standardized tests take precedence, an age in which numbers are more important than people, that\u0027s what I need to remember.Founder, SammichesPsychMeds.comI think of his family today, mourning someone they knew and loved while a world of strangers feels their own grief for whichever incarnation of David Bowie spoke to them.Writer, runner, mermaid, Bowie fanaticOn Saturday, six Republican candidates for president joined Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator Tim Scott, and other members of their party for a forum on poverty in America. Some of what they said made sense. Much of what they proposed did not.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor34Justice co-founder and bloggerI\u0027m not proud of it, but the concepts of \u0027renewal\u0027 and \u0027recovery\u0027 felt so foreign that my body wanted to reject them in the same violent way it rejected goji berries when I tried (read: failed) to get on-board the \u0027superfood\u0027 bandwagon. But the science of energy management just made so much sense.CEO of Emergent Solutions and 2014 G20 Youth Summit ChairIn our children\u0027s eyes especially, we\u0027re all kooks with quirks and flaws. At the root of this song is a celebration of this fact, a loving disclaimer from parent to child: we\u0027re not perfect, we\u0027re actually a little strange.Deputy Features Editor, The Huffington PostThere is a social institution called education, and there is a faculty called critical thinking that education is designed to hone. It is not a statistical fluke that, on average, the more education Republican primary voters have, the less they support Donald Trump.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorHaving the freedom to kick the proverbial can down the road is a freedom Nature doesn\u0027t afford women. If I\u0027m the right age to cryopreserve and so many people I know say they want it, why am I the only woman I know with a box full of drugs in her living room?Hardware operations product manager, System-in-Package at Apple Inc.While many factors can affect a candidate\u0027s polling numbers, one uncomfortable conclusion can\u0027t be overlooked when it comes to reactions to Cruz\u0027s \"carpet-bombing\" comments: by and large, Americans don\u0027t think or care much about the real-world consequences of the unleashing of American air power.Author, Political Animals: How Our Stone Age Brain Gets in the Way of Smart PoliticsRepublicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act for five years. But they\u0027ve made absolutely no effort to patch the massive gaping hole that would leave behind. They don\u0027t want to.International President, United SteelworkersIn Kabul, where the Afghan Peace Volunteers have hosted me in their community, the U.S. military maintains a huge blimp equipped with cameras and computers to supply 24-hour surveillance of the city.Co-coordinator, Voices for Creative NonviolenceAs a budding writer, I found his lyrics amazing, complex, opaque and wonderful (only Roxy Music could compete). The haze of ambiguity around his sexuality was also appealing. His music, of course, wasn\u0027t like anything anyone else was playing and each album was wildly unpredictable.Author, reviewer, and bloggerNot that any of the pro-gun, anti-Obama rhetoric was unexpected. But what provoked the greatest amount of attention on both sides of the political spectrum was the discussion at the end of the event when the president derisively dismissed the idea of gun confiscation as a \"conspiracy theory\" that had no basis in reality or truth.Mike the Gun GuyIf we care at all about future generations, we must listen to the president\u0027s call for sensible gun legislation, while at the same time push for national police reform. We cannot address one while ignoring the other.President, National Action NetworkMy courage grew three sizes that day on the subway platform. I\u0027m now less worried about other people\u0027s reactions to my trying on women\u0027s shoes or testing nude lipsticks. What does any of it really matter? It\u0027s my life. I own it.Blogger, I Am Michael, Hear Me RohrerDolce \u0026 Gabbana is setting precedence by disregarding the influence of bigotry inundating media outlets that is geared toward Muslims, by releasing a collection intended for a highly-scrutinized community during a very sensitive time.PhD student in Religious Studies at University of California, RiversideGuantanamo is not only a symbol of the U.S. failure to fully change course, it is also an ongoing human rights tragedy where the United States continues to imprison 104 men indefinitely, most without charge or trial. What can U.S. condemnation of other nations\u0027 human rights abuses mean in the face of 14 years indefinite detention in an offshore prison of men not convicted of any crime?Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstDavid Bowie was beautiful in the most untraditional ways. I was drawn to his whimsy, his edges, his charisma, as much as I was to his piercing eyes and alluring smile. I\u0027ve had a crush on him forever. When I heard that he\u0027d died, I felt my chest tighten and I cried; I felt a thread of my own fabric pulled.Mother, Writer, Traveler, Treasure Hunter and Sushi lover. Dawn was named a BlogHer \"Voices of the Year\" for 2015 and writes regularly on her blog: Tales From the Motherland.Whether or not Professor Hawkins has violated Wheaton College\u0027s Statement of Faith will be decided by Wheaton College. But I am with those who believe that she was moved by her understanding of Christ\u0027s commandment to love and stand with the vulnerable and the stranger, whoever they may be at the moment.Teacher, writer, francophileThe stark reality is that American policies over the past year have substantially strengthened al-Qaeda. Some of the Obama administration\u0027s actions in Syria have materially increased its operational capability.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWhen I was raped in June, I realized I couldn\u0027t be silent, and my personal blog made that possible for me. Most people on my Facebook timeline are probably sick and tired of seeing my blog posts, the articles I share, and the references to my rape. It\u0027s understandable.Student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel HillThe real advantage for any of Hillary\u0027s opponents in having Bill on the hustings is that his trade record too is not just fair game, but big game -- one that is the top priority of a great many American voters who want to see decades of trade policy failures reversed beginning in 2017.President, U.S. Business \u0026 Industry CouncilIf you\u0027re in the same boat as me, please know that you don\u0027t have to suffer alone. Your mental health concerns are nothing to be ashamed of. Go to your GP. Tell them how you are feeling. If you walk away feeling embarrassed or ashamed or unsupported, it\u0027s time to find a new GP, because I promise, you don\u0027t need to feel alone in your suffering anymore.In real life and online, my words are often followed by exclamation points!After endless cycles of death, suffering, and public grief punctuating much of 2015, our country yearns for life. Our children deserve nothing less, and we cannot abdicate our responsibility to make a safe and nurturing society reality for all of our children.Executive Vice President, Union Theological SeminaryIn \"The Revenant,\" Alejandro González Iñárritu has fashioned a powerful, soaring reverie of love, duty and survival... an environmentalist\u0027s epic which raises questions not just of family and relationships, but of the morality and impact of Western colonization.Political WriterOnly in the minds of gun enthusiasts is an action that is \"legally meaningless\" construed as the president repealing the second amendment. The president is not coming to take your guns.Political blogger, Detroit NewsSaudis are becoming increasingly disillusioned and angry with their government\u0027s domestic and economic policies, and the government\u0027s foreign policies are slowly becoming less popular as well. Now, after his execution, Nimr is emerging as an icon to the Shiite Arab community. And the fate of Arab governments who have executed Shiite religious leaders is haunting. Nearly all of them have collapsed.Saudi scholar and writerThe press seems too nervous to call out the dangerous and disgusting behavior. People who cover politics know that what\u0027s unfolding at the Trump rallies is unheard of. They know it\u0027s extraordinary. They know it\u0027s potentially very dangerous.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIf some one read or saw Wild and got inspired to outfit themselves and take to a trail that is a good thing. That is one more person exploring the benefits of an enhanced relationship with the natural world. Does it really matter what inspired them to do it?Science teacher, trail runner, dog mother, writer, naturalist, farmer, radio producer, aunt, tidepool fanaticGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
