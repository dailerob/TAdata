{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe drama that played out in Greece this week is of historic importance. What is at stake goes well beyond the future of the eurozone. It is the very essence of the great postwar civilizational compact that brought unprecedented prosperity and political stability to Europe. For it is the repeal of the understandings, principles and sense of comity associated with that project that is the clear target of the financial forces that control the continent\u0027s economic affairs. Alexis Tsipras dared to reject an ultimatum whereby his country would be relegated to a permanent condition of debt servitude or thrown to the wolves of the untamed financial markets. The game is an unsavory one whereby the Troika extract anything of value and transfer it to the banks and hedge fund speculators who made spectacularly reckless loans to previous, compromised government leaders. The resistance to that fate by a government that has received a mandate from the electorate is deemed illegitimate.When reporters covering presidential politics employ words they fully know will disparage female candidates -- or when they purport to discern dishonesty by examining candidates\u0027 facial expressions -- they are taking journalistic prerogative too far.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027No doubt, Obama and his White House advisers think they are handling difficult domestic political dynamics with admirable adroitness. But, in diplomatic terms, their approach assumes that other key players -- including Iran -- will wait indefinitely for Washington to get serious about closing a deal.Authors, \u0027Going to Tehran\u0027; Penn State Professor and American University Senior Lecturer\"It\u0027s really frustrating to think that my family might suffer from my information having been stolen.\" Those are the words of David Thul, who served 22 years with the Minnesota National Guard, was deployed to Kosovo in 2003 and again to Iraq from 2005 to 2007. \"My country didn\u0027t have my back.\"Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Ndume Olatushani is an artist, organizer, and a passionate advocate for justice who works with the Children\u0027s Defense Fund\u0027s Nashville organizing team. He helps us fight to keep children and people of color, especially Black boys, out of the Cradle to Prison Pipeline™.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundTrump certainly acts and sounds like a racial bigot. But whether he really is or not, there is a much deeper issue here -- Donald Trump is a salesman who sees that racial bigotry still works with a core base of the Republican Party.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIf, and only if, the U.S. can pivot from a completed deal to a broader regional peace will it be possible to judge the outcome a success. Otherwise it\u0027s \"off to the races\", since a deal without a determined follow-up program may be just a bad as (and maybe worse than) no deal at all.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027We assumed Europe\u0027s era of mass killing had ended with World War II; Srebrenica proved us wrong. Srebrenica revealed a terrible truth about the institutions on which the post-War world depends.Member of the Board of the Committee to Protect JournalistsMy cat is my bae, my eyebrows are #onbleak, and I rejoice when weekend plans are unexpectedly cancelled. At 24, I often feel much closer to a comfortable 62. Fortunately (or unfortunately) I am not alone.Freelance writer and reporterThere\u0027s no question that Nixon was a complex figure, but diagnoses of his psyche from afar are theories lacking proof, readings of his soul as well as his mind by people who never knew him.JournalistAs a longtime employee of the Washington Post Company, I shared the negative, almost cartoonist view of Tricky Dick. But as I got into his extensive papers and the hundreds of oral histories and many of hours of White House tapes, I realized Nixon was a more complex figure.Author, \u0027Being Nixon\u0027While TFA operationalizes and cashes in on promoting the failed school myth all the while in partnership with corps member \"success stories,\" what is needed most are counter-narratives that tell a more honest story about what it means to be a teacher -- and in particular, what it means to have entered teaching by way of TFA.Ph.D. Student, Researcher, Writer, EducatorIt\u0027s a hypnotically attractive argument. It sounds tough -- more troops! -- but the number is low enough that proponents can claim, with a straight face, that we aren\u0027t repeating the Iraq War all over again. Ten thousand. More than Obama. (\"I\u0027ll be tougher!\") Less than Bush. (\"But I\u0027ve learned my lesson!\") Just right.U.S. Senator from ConnecticutStern\u0027s surrealist imagery with a subversive feminist twist showed her intellectual reach and native cleverness and made for inventive and audacious photography which far exceeded the raw material.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnConscious business is not a theory -- it is a way to work and live.

The smart phone in your pocket affords you access to more information than contained in the entire library at Alexandria, in case you occasionally become puzzled or bored. Living in the present: What\u0027s not to like? Only this. We were all born too soon.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe horrific slaying of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco by a convicted felon who illegally crossed the border five times shocked our community, our state and our nation.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeThe resurgence of Ebola in Liberia is a sharp reminder that all efforts to fight the epidemic must remain high and that the international community should continue to be mobilized.President \u0026 CEO, Save the ChildrenEven as the Confederate flag is removed from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds, shock waves are still echoing after the June 17 Charleston Massacre. Will their deaths change us? Are they martyrs for the cause of racial justice, or just nine more black victims of racism?Metropolitan Community ChurchesIn Wael Shawky\u0027s trilogy it\u0027s historicism, not history, that is being culled, a deliberate seeing in the past the makings of the present or more recent past.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoPresident Obama deserves a big thank you for these designations, and I\u0027ll show you where to do that in a moment. But first, I want to point out that most of the work that went into making these designations possible didn\u0027t happen in Washington, D.C.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubAs I examine the past 10 years of my life, I realize that it has become less about what others think of me or my choices and more about whether I\u0027m smiling or frowning.Writer.The California Senate has sent the Assembly an important elephant protection measure that would prohibit the menacing weapon called the bullhook that is used in circuses and other entertainment to control captive elephants through fear and pain.42nd Mayor of Los AngelesMayor of Oakland, CaliforniaIt was not the Grateful Dead, simply because nothing could ever be the Grateful Dead without Jerry.

Son.Always stretch before you run -- you\u0027ve heard it 1,000 times. While the advice makes intuitive sense, you might be shocked to learn there\u0027s no research to support this wisdom. And now a study from Texas A\u0026M University suggests that stretching can actually slow you down!Prevention provides service journalism at its best: news, perspective-shifting features and practical strategies to enhance lives.Before any politicians, corporations or citizens get too excited and feel any urge to celebrate a positive social response to last month\u0027s Charleston massacre, we must remember that a range of organizations have addressed only the first part of the problem of this specific tragedy.
