{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"MONTREAL -- I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of our fourth international edition, Le Huffington Post Québec, which joins HuffPost Canada in covering America\u0027s neighbor to the north. This is the first time we\u0027ll have two HuffPost editions in the same country, a reflection of our commitment to being a hub of reporting, comprehensive curation, group blogging and engagement across all of Canada. This French-language edition will encompass all things Québec and be run by a strong locally-based editorial team with deep personal and professional roots in the province. So, for everyone in Québec -- as well as those of you who speak French, and are interested in Canada\u0027s largest province -- check out Le Huffington Post Québec, and join the conversation.Read Post | Comments (191)Chris Mooney, 2/8/12Author, \u0027The Republican War on Science\u0027 and \u0027The Republican Brain\u0027From global warming denial to claims about \"death panels\" to baseless fears about inflation, it often seems there are so many factually wrong claims on the political right that those who make them live in a different reality. Maybe they actually do.Read Post | Comments (888)J. Nwando Olayiwola, 02.08.2012Family Practice Physician \u0026 Chief Medical Officer of Community Health Center, Inc.The United States has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the industrialized world. The good news is that there are great tools out there to help. Indeed, a text-messaging service that delivers vital health information to mothers at various stages of their pregnancy and during the first year of their child\u0027s life, is one of them.Read Post | CommentsBruce Ackerman and Ian Ayres, 2/8/12It is in nobody\u0027s interest to see the Supreme Court\u0027s legitimacy damaged as Super PACs increasingly erode Americans\u0027 fundamental commitment to democracy. The Court should be given a second-chance to define the meaning of free speech.Read Post | Comments (54)Barbara Becker, 2/8/12Founder, EqualShot; Faculty, Columbia UniversityWhile walking with my 8-year-old son near our home in Manhattan, he spotted a purple swastika scrawled across a billboard advertisement. As I took in the complexities of the situation, my son uttered words that made my heart break.Read Post | Comments (81)Lisa Belkin, 2/7/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, Huffington PostI am not here to chastise parents for \"helping\" on school projects. To the contrary, I am here to confess that I\u0027ve done it myself, more than once.Read Post | Comments (27)Christopher Holshek, 2/8/12Colonel (retired), U.S. Army (Reserve) Civil AffairsThe \"rise of the rest,\" which has been going for more than a half a century, is the product of how successful a job the United States has done as Chairman of the Board of Planetary Management. We are victims of our own success, having globalized everything but ourselves.Read Post | CommentsThomas B. Edsall, 2/8/12Joseph Pulitzer II and Edith Pulitzer Moore Professor, Columbia School of JournalismThe contest for power between Democrats and Republicans pits two antithetical value systems against each other; two conflicting concepts of freedom, liberty, fairness, right, and wrong; two mutually exclusive notions of the state, the individual, and the collective good.Read Post | Comments (662)Amy Ephron, 2/8/12AuthorI have a complicated relationship with my Keurig. It was given to us at Christmas by my husband\u0027s children. I\u0027d never seen anything like it before, which made them laugh hysterically (as it did half my friends).Read Post | CommentsFrancine Shapiro, Ph.D., 2/5/12Director, EMDR Institute; Senior Research Fellow, Mental Research Institute; Founder, EMDR Humanitarian Assistance ProgramsWhen I first began to develop EMDR therapy back in 1987, I experimented with everyone who was willing to volunteer. One of the things I found very interesting was that often the problem they were concentrating on would spontaneously connect in their minds to earlier memories that were related in some way. That\u0027s how I began to discover that the past was really present.Read Post | Comments (21)Radley Balko, 2/8/12Senior Writer and Investigative Reporter, The Huffington PostHow can we be facing an epidemic of overdose deaths wrought by too many prescriptions for painkillers and, at the same time, be facing a public health crisis of undertreated pain?Read Post | Comments (12)Clare Winterton, 2/8/12Executive Director, International Museum of WomenRead Post | CommentsStanley A. Dashew, 2/8/12Innovator; Entrepreneur; Industrialist; PhilanthropistWhat bothers you? I mean, what really grates on your nerves? Chances are, whatever the problem, others feel the same way. I made my first fortune in starting a company that automated the credit card industry, because paper cards were very problematic and really grated on the nerves of bankers.Read Post | CommentsBarry Levinson, 2/8/12Academy Award-winning Director, Screenwriter and ProducerNothing fluctuates daily in price like oil. All other businesses have some kind of sale celebrations going on periodically. Not when it comes to oil. And for whatever reason, we have accepted it.Read Post | Comments (27)Robert Redford, 2/8/12Actor, director, and environmental activistThe Keystone XL pipeline doesn\u0027t deliver on jobs or national security, it jeopardizes public health and safety and the president was right to reject it.Read Post | Comments (132)Marlo Thomas, 2/7/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistIt\u0027s not every day that the federal government issues a postage stamp with your dad\u0027s picture on it. But our dad was not your every day kind of guy. On February 16, the U.S. Postal Service will officially release the new Danny Thomas stamp.Read Post | Comments (84)Gavin Shulman, 2/8/12Writer, ProducerRepublican people are very passionate about non-Republican people\u0027s babies. They are all for individual liberty, except when it comes to producing individuals. Which, ironically, they think should be done liberally.Read Post | Comments (11)Brian Rooney, 2/8/12Writer and journalistWhen I hear former House Speaker Newt Gingrich rail against the \"radical\" Saul Alinsky, I just smile. Gingrich has reached into the past to find an enemy for the present, but I know something about Saul Alinsky.Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 2/8/12President, Hart International, Ltd.Instead of endlessly and ineffectively interviewing the Santorums of the world, wouldn\u0027t it be interesting if just one of the Sunday morning talk programs rounded up George W. Bush and his cohorts to hold them accountable for the monumental act of folly that is still unfolding in Iraq?Read Post | Comments (85)Matthew Bowman, 2/8/12Author, \u0027The Mormon People: The Making of an American Faith\u0027It is a mistake to assume that Mormonism is a monolithic whole. Like any faith the Mormon tradition includes within it a wide range of theological opinion.Read Post | Comments (17)Cara Santa Maria, 2/6/12Science correspondent, Huffington Post; editor, Talk Nerdy to MeWomen make up just about half of the American workforce, but we hold less than a quarter of the STEM jobs. Why is that?Read Post | Comments (599)Robert Reich, 2/8/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027So now a relative handful of super-rich Democrats want to fight a relative handful of super-rich Republicans. And we call this a democracy.Read Post | Comments (286)Clay Farris Naff, 2/8/12Science writer, journalist, authorWhen President Obama used the occasion of the National Prayer Breakfast to say that for the fortunate to pay a little more to help the less fortunate \"coincides\" with Jesus\u0027 teachings, he must have touched a nerve.Read Post | CommentsGregory Ferenstein, 2/8/12Author and educatorIn just four years, an invite to the breakout annual conference has become a coveted opportunity for emerging leaders in business, art, and government to co-mingle with their peers in adventurous activities and dream up ways to solve pressing social issues.Read Post | CommentsDr. Michael J. Breus, 2/8/12Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistThere\u0027s still a great deal of information about the effects of sleep on the brain that we don\u0027t yet understand, so any research that sheds light on this subject is exciting and potentially important.Read Post | Comments (13)Jason Rodi, 2/8/12AdventurerWe\u0027ll be travelling from a cape in South America to Africa, stopping at Bouvet Island, where fewer people have been to than the moon. Both capes represent the toughest seas on Earth, but for me it\u0027s much more than that. It\u0027s completing the loop from the end of human exploration to the beginning of civilization.Read Post | CommentsMarc Mauer, 2/8/12Executive director, The Sentencing ProjectIt\u0027s hardly a secret that the relationship between African American communities and law enforcement has been fraught with conflict. From the old days of station-house beatings to get a confession to today\u0027s \"stop and frisk\" practices, an awful lot of mistrust has been engendered.Read Post | CommentsD. R.
