To the children who experienced this abuse, my heart goes out to you and I commend you for the courageous dignity and restraint you demonstrated during this incident by refusing to retaliate in kind. There are many powerful, nonviolent ways to respond to this injustice, including dignified, disciplined nonviolent protests and demonstrations and voter registration drives in your communities.
