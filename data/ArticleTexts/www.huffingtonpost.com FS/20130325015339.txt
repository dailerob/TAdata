{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, President Obama gave a well-received tough-love speech in Israel, Syria may or may not have used chemical weapons, and Cyprus was given until Monday to come up with a restructuring Plan B after its parliament rejected Plan A: a 10 percent \"haircut\" tax on bank deposits over $100,000. Even more suspect than the health of Cyprus\u0027 banks is the decision-making on how to save them. \"Impressively stupid\" is how Cyprus.com described the EU\u0027s ambush of newly-elected (and pro-EU) President Anastassiades with a plan that -- by grabbing insured deposits -- would damage bank confidence throughout the EU. How can leaders make decisions this \"impressively stupid?\" As Felix Salmon writes, it was a move \"born of an unholy combination of procrastination, blackmail, and sleep-deprived gamesmanship.\" For proof that this kind of decision making isn\u0027t exclusive to Europe, this week was also the 10th anniversary of one of the most \"impressively stupid\" and profoundly tragic decisions in U.S. history: the invasion of Iraq.Comments (109)Alec BaldwinActorHow do I convey this without offending the gay community, or women who are supportive of more women in politics, or those who believe that Michael Bloomberg was a great mayor for New York? It may be impossible, but here goes. Christine Quinn is not qualified to be mayor of New York.Comments (444)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowIf you are reading this, you likely know I left a highly successful, self-titled show at MSNBC last June in search of meaning and purpose in my work and life. I had lost both after 18 years in Manhattan, and it was a three-tour Iraq combat Marine and his war-protestor wife who pointed me in a new direction.Comments (215)Arianna HuffingtonThere\u0027s nothing touchy-feely about increased profits. This is a tough economy, and it\u0027s going to be that way for a long time. Stress-reduction and mindfulness don\u0027t just make us happier and healthier, they\u0027re a proven competitive advantage for any business that wants one.Comments (164)Joshua FoerWinner of the USA Memory Championship; Co-founder, Atlas ObscuraHere\u0027s the thing: Despite being U.S. memory champions, Kolli, Dellis, and I occasionally misplace our car keys, just like everyone else. We don\u0027t actually have great memories.Comments (197)Margaret ChoComedian, actor and recording artistHatred and homophobia can never be underestimated. And the effect of someone saying \"God hates fags\" can never be underestimated either. It\u0027s a license to kill. It\u0027s a death sentence. It\u0027s not funny. It\u0027s not OK. It\u0027s not something I can let go easily, because I know what it truly means.Comments (395)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistRumor has it the U.S. Senate will consider a budget bill provision to approve the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. Here\u0027s what they need to share with their constituents.Comments (610)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAnyone who knows me will tell you that I love when things are organized. When I first moved in with my husband and his teenage boys, I actually color-coded their towels. It worked! And my desk is an organizational work of art -- pens over there, paperwork over here and a typed to-do list just to be sure I get it all done.Comments (53)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOEurope has more than an immediate economic and financial interest in working with Cyprus to stabilize an increasingly volatile situation. And it should do so driven less by the need avoid an institutional Eurozone exit and more by the importance of fundamentally restoring growth and hope to Cyprus.Comments (187)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe psychological and emotional toll of gun violence on bystanders, victims, and families can be overwhelming and leaves effects that last for years. What about the costs we can count? In addition to the trauma that is so deep and pervasive that it is harder to quantify, there are actual costs to gun violence that can be measured and are enormous.Comments (410)Simon JohnsonAuthor, \u0027White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You\u0027In plain English, what Sir John Peace said is called lying. Or, if you prefer the language of securities lawyers, he engaged in deliberate misrepresentation. He also violated Standard Chartered\u0027s deferred prosecution agreement with US authorities.Comments (54)Queen Rania of JordanQueen of the Hashemite Kingdom of JordanIn the last few years, we\u0027ve witnessed seismic shifts in the political, economic and social landscape of the Middle East and North Africa. Through it all, Arab women did what women everywhere do best: They multi-tasked.Comments (22)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio hostI just finished speaking with the incredible \"fourth tenor\" Andrea Bocelli about his new album, Passione.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarAs we look at the rise of females in charge, there\u0027s been speculation of a future of kinder, gentler work environments. Maybe that will happen, maybe it won\u0027t. But guaranteed, the onus isn\u0027t on the queen bee alone. It\u0027s on her worker bees as well.Comments (565)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayWe veterans of WWII and everyone who remembers Eisenhower, this gentle man with the giant fist, the president who kept us out of conflict after conflict, often against the advice of those around him, have an investment in how he is remembered.Comments (146)Una LaMarcheEditor of \u0027The Sassy Curmudgeon\u0027All of the organic, fair-trade, pasture-raised artisanal Play-Doh and 800-count recycled hemp crib sheets in the world won\u0027t matter if you as a parent don\u0027t feel at least reasonably happy and cared for.Comments (200)Barry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerJudges in Washington are mulling over the complaints that the Redskin trademark is offensive to Native Americans. And if it is indeed offensive it should be removed. Once Washington selects a new name, we might have to investigate the New Orleans Saints. It has a religious ring to it.Comments (37)Christine LagardeManaging Director, IMFThe goal of continued stability -- and certainly the hope for more broadly shared growth -- cannot be taken lightly. Everybody I spoke to in Algiers agreed the country needs a more open and diverse economy to create a bigger pie, and to ensure that all Algerians get their fair share in it.Comments (32)Evan HandlerActor, author, screenwriter, and journalistI am tired to the bone of the baseless and uninformed criticisms people continue to hurl toward the Livestrong Foundation, based on crimes Lance committed as a cyclist.Comments (143)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsToday, General Lloyd Austin became the first African-American to lead the U.S. Central Command, which has a wide-ranging area of responsibility for 20 countries in the Middle East and southwest Asia. His appointment is effective immediately.Comments (60)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt is those who would deny same-sex couples the right to marry on the premise that same-sex marriage is bad for children who must bear the burden of proof. And it is a heavy burden, indeed.Comments (136)Criss AngelAward-winning magician, authorThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone has some speculating that the art of magic has become passé. Magic will never disappear. The only mystery will be what form it will take and how it will amaze us by remaining relevant to the culture it reflects.Comments (36)Cherie Blair and Siddharth ChatterjeeWomen are half India\u0027s demographic dividend; if they are given the right tools and community support, they can not only become financially independent, but could also become the engines that fuel India\u0027s future growth.CommentsGraham NashSinger-Songwriter, Photographer and ActivistAs with songwriting, that space just before you fall to sleep (what Crosby calls \"When the elves take over the workshop\") is most informative and often leads to the creation of a song. In my dream I became friends with former President George W. Bush.Comments (73)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkThere\u0027s a reason why Blacks, Latinos, Asians, gays, immigrants and other groups overwhelmingly voted with the Democrats during the last election -- mainly that we vote with those who fight for greater equality.Comments (715)Mary Jo KilroyFormer Member of Congress, Columbus, OhioCrowley, Harlow and Callan need to think about the young victim and the physical, mental, and emotional trauma she has been through. They need to question the place of football in our society. They need to stop blaming the victim.Comments (168)Grover NorquistPresident, Americans for Tax ReformThe Fourth Amendment -- the one that is supposed to keep the government out of your mail and outside your door -- is one area that can unite grownups of the left and right.Comments (81)Ruth RileyWNBA Player and Olympic Gold MedalistAs a professional basketball player, I have had amazing opportunities to use my talents, to play with the best players in the world, and even to represent my country in the Olympics. All of those opportunities began at home.CommentsSec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesAmericans are getting more value for their health care dollars due to the health care law. Affordable Care Act initiatives are promoting coordinated care; paying for quality, not quantity; and dramatically reducing fraud and waste, contributing to the slowest growth in national health spending in 50 years.Comments (230)Steve-OAuthor, \"Professional Idiot\"; stunt performerThere\u0027s a lot of violence in the world, but here\u0027s an area where all of us can make a positive difference, first in our own lives, and then in the lives of others. Together, we can spread compassion far and wide.Comments (832)Sen. Mazie HironoU.S. Senator for HawaiiEarlier this week, I chaired a Senate hearing on an issue that\u0027s gotten a lot of attention recently, but has been a defining and personal subject for me my whole life: immigration -- specifically, its effect on families.Comments (113)HuffPost Radio, 2013.24.03Catherine Ventura, 2013.24.03Scott Thumma, Ph.D., 2013.24.03James Clear, 2013.24.03Karin Kamp, 2013.24.03Zainab Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, 2013.24.03Amy Pascal, 2013.24.03Vala Afshar, 2013.24.03Dan Persons, 2013.24.03Laurence J.
