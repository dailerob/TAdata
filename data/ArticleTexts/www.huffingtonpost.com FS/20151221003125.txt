{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation reconnected with a beloved movie franchise -- and from the reviews, \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip\" lives up to the hype. Meanwhile, in a galaxy far, far away, a small indie movie, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" also opened. And not a moment too soon, since our own galaxy could use a good dose of the Force. Witness Tuesday\u0027s Republican debate, in which several candidates vied to boost their foreign policy cred by portraying themselves as annihilator-in-chief, vowing to commit all manner of war crimes, from carpet bombing the Middle East (Cruz) and killing innocent children (Carson), to killing the families of terrorists (Trump) and placing all Ewoks in detention centers (Christie). (Sadly, only one of these is made up). The problem is, this isn\u0027t a movie, so it\u0027s up to us to prevent these ugly plot twists. To quote a small, green, 900-year-old pundit: \"fear is the path to the Dark Side.\"We are all children of God (or nature or whatever you believe in), part of the human family, and nothing you say or do can change that fact one iota. If you don\u0027t like living by these American rules, then you need to go to the time-out room in any one of your Towers, sit there, and think about what you\u0027ve said.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorThis week Congress got something done. Our country\u0027s legislators reached across the aisle and passed a landmark bill that will increase the federal funding of Alzheimer\u0027s research by $350 million next year.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and leading Alzheimer’s advocateI am guessing this is probably not the last time I will say the wrong thing, or say something the wrong way.Public speaker, activist, OlympianSo here\u0027s the big idea I think will shape 2016: sleep. That\u0027s right, sleep! How much and how well we sleep in the coming year -- and the years to follow -- will determine, in no small measure, our ability to address and solve the problems we\u0027re facing as individuals and as a society.In what\u0027s become something of a sick annual tradition, members of Congress attached a multitude of riders to this must-pass piece of legislation in an attempt to sneak through deeply unpopular things they could never justify introducing or voting for on their own.Director, Represent.UsCommunications Director, Represent.UsWhen I heard President Hollande mention the critical goal of 1.5°C I knew this would be a different COP. He was the first world leader from a developed country to utter the ceiling of 1.5°C. And the world took notice.Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationThe anxious class feels vulnerable to forces over which they have no control. Terrible things happen for no reason. Yet government can\u0027t be counted on to protect them.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Police officers often lack the training to approach the mentally unstable. This lack of training, of course, makes little sense, given the significant size and possible threat of that very population -- of an estimated eight million Americans living with severe mental illness, half are untreated.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAlthough I often disagree with Justice Scalia, and although I emphatically disagree with him about the constitutionality of affirmative action, the outrage and condemnation sparked by this comment is completely unwarranted.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThree years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut where a lone 20-year-old gunman wielding an assault weapon snuffed out 26 child and teacher lives, our nation has done shamefully little to protect children instead of guns.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIf the Fed raises interest rates for the first time since the Great Recession, they will effectively be declaring \"mission accomplished\" on jobs and wages. But there is a major issue: The data simply does not support a rate hike.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeProgressives need to build the infrastructure and the foundation at the state level to lay the groundwork for policy wins -- now is the time to dig deeper into the states. We must make progress now and over the long-term to help families make ends meet.Former Secretary of Health and Human ServicesFor 40 years, Republicans and some Democrats have been demanding an end to the ban on crude oil exports. The omnibus bill lifts that ban just as the world community meeting in Paris agreed that emissions released from fossil fuels must be lowered if the planet is to escape incineration.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Quality care requires trained, qualified providers operating in safe, well-equipped facilities. It means not only numeracy and literacy, but a nutritious diet and nurturing staff members. And it means rich exposure to words and language, especially for children being raised in poverty.U.S. Senator from New HampshireLas Vegas makes its money by catering to our baser appetites. Last night, Republicans followed suit. Carpet bomb ISIS. Take out Assad. Destroy Iran. Shoot down Russian planes. Launch cyberwar against China. Expand the Army, Navy, Air Force; modernize nuclear weapons on land, sea and air.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureBecause so few women have employer-provided retirement benefits or personal savings on which to rely, Social Security is disproportionately their sole source of income in old age. For 49 percent of never-married, divorced and widowed women aged 65 and older, Social Security comprises virtually all of their income. That is nearly one out of two single women!Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksPresident, National Organization for WomenIt\u0027s increasingly clear that Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Chair of the Democratic National Committee, isn\u0027t acting as a neutral party Chair, trying to insure a fair and democratic primary and building the Democratic Party in the states. Rather, she\u0027s acting as a shill for Hillary Clinton, doing everything in her power to ensure that no one will effectively challenge Hillary\u0027s coronation as the nominee.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistIn a system still characterized by entrenched patriarchy, voting for municipal council seats might seem like progress, or simply window dressing.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceFor good and often surrealistic entertainment, read the Journal. I do every morning. For serious business analysis, it\u0027s The Financial Times and other specialized business outlets.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversitySorry, well-meaning Actually Man, but I don\u0027t need your input. These dudes\u0027 self-assuredness is hilarious to me. They show up guns blazing to a battle I\u0027ve already been in for my entire life. It turns out that these men telling me to \"man up\" are just so incredibly fragile and sad.Comedian, writer, producerThe deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process appears to be illogical and unsettling as a majority of Israelis and Palestinians realize that coexistence, whether under conditions of enmity or friendship, is a fact that neither side can change short of a catastrophe.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUOne of my favorite posters at Facebook says, \"Nothing At Facebook Is Someone Else\u0027s Problem.\" The inequities that persist are everyone\u0027s problem -- gender inequality harms men and women, racism hurts whites and minorities, and equal opportunity benefits us all.The best answer to any questionBecause my Iranian-born parents automatically passed down their nationality on to me through jus sanguinis laws and I am an Iranian-American dual national, now I\u0027m uncertain if freely traveling to see my family will be a possibility due to the recent passage of a discriminatory House billSamira is currently pursuing a masters in Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Oxford. She was born and raised in Los Angeles.Washington has been the main contributor to the emergence of a singularly complex challenge that threatens our interests and the stability of the region. We only compound our culpability while reducing the chances of finding a tolerable way out of the jam if we remain addicted to fanciful thinking.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghSleep research that we have conducted at Brigham and Women\u0027s Hospital in Boston has shown that healthy individuals sleep for far shorter periods of time when they are living at home than when they are in a controlled setting where they must remain in bed for longer than they usually do at home.Physician; Associate Professor at The Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical SchoolTomorrow\u0027s climate will still be unlike anything our current civilization grew up with. But we now see a path to a different future and we have taken the first courageous steps along that path. My glass is half-full, with French champagne.President, Pacific InstituteBarack Obama is president for one more year. He has responded calmly to the rush of recent events, and not let calls for World War stampede him into hasty moves. For a man who received the Nobel Peace Prize in his first year in office, Obama has had to spend a lot of his time deciding on military actions.Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassador\"[On] a normal day, we see massacres and a lot of airstrikes,\" one man said, speaking in Arabic. \"What has become not normal ... is if you don\u0027t hear any attacks, if you don\u0027t hear bullets being fired, if you don\u0027t see any signs of war -- this is something we\u0027re not used to. We\u0027ve become used to war.\"Blog Editor, The Huffington PostIn the wake of the Paris terror attacks of November, 13 that left 130 dead and the San Bernardino, Calif. terror attack of December 2 that killed 14 and left another 22 wounded, anti-Muslim hate crime attacks appear to have risen sharply across the United States to a level nearly three times the monthly average of the last five years.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityLike a lot of progressive-minded folks, I\u0027d grown more aware in recent years of Sen. Bernie Sanders, and his cast-out-the-money-changers rants against income inequality, corporate greed, and billionaire influence in American politics.Author, \u0027The Bern Identity\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
