{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIt\u0027s entirely obvious now that the Iraq War was a horrible deal for the U.S, the thousands of lives we lost, and the thousands more who came home wounded and maimed, inside and out. Jeb dishonored all of them with his recent comments. If Jeb truly thinks that it was a \"good deal\" for us, then he also must be lying when he says that he wouldn\u0027t have launched the war in Iraq, knowing then what we do now. After all, if what we know now is that we ended up with a \"good deal,\" then of course he\u0027d do it all over again. Yet, in the debate and his speech this week, he went through great pains to say he\u0027d avoid the war in Iraq. They say a gaffe is when a politician tells you what they really think. I\u0027ve never seen a clearer example of that, than in Jeb\u0027s latest comment. The truth of the matter is that Jeb Bush has no idea what he\u0027s talking about. None.Exactly how Top Secret/SCI information wound up on Hillary Clinton\u0027s private server is a critical question and one likely to lead to the downfall of some assistants and possibly Clinton herself.Professor of International and Public Affairs at the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War \u0026 Peace Studies at Columbia UniversityThis focus on legal citizenship is important, but it\u0027s only part of the story.

Have you not read the editorials, articles and commentaries? I am now in prison for a crime I did not commit.Lawyer and former CIA case officerOpenly loving a trans woman might seem like a courageous act, but it is not nearly enough. Circumstances demand that we come out as a community, speak out, and join the struggle to ensure that trans lives truly matter.Development Associate at the Center for Constitutional RightsTo create true change involves disrupting the current systems that seek to oppress, and true allies and accomplices understand that to create equity means a willingness to give up something for the good of all. Anything less is empty words and more of the same.Founder, Black Girl in Maine; Executive Director, Community Change IncAfter 50 years of stagnation, the sense of progress and potential is real. We are under no illusions that Cuba will be transformed overnight, and we are clear-eyed about the challenges ahead. Among these is Cuba\u0027s continued denial of universal human rights.U.S. Secretary of StateWhere are the neighbors? Where are the schools and community organizations? Who reaches out to see what the problem is? Does anyone see this child/youth desperately in need of help and hope? Who listens or offers a helping hand amidst the violence and despair they face daily?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe actions of many in Congress (such as Rep. Collins) suggest that a few years in prison may be every bit as valuable in preparing to serve in that institution as a few years spent in a different sort of institution of higher education.LawyerDeliverance or calamity, recession-oriented or development-oriented, the \"best possible agreement,\" or the \"worst of them all,\" the new agreement between Athens and its creditors still has an uncertain fate and even more uncertain consequences.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceOne of the biggest sources of that doubt about women\u0027s abilities comes from women themselves. The next time you shy away from a promotion or an opportunity in favor of sticking with what you know or what you\u0027ve been told you\u0027re good at, reconsider. Knowing what works can be comfortable. It can also be an easy way to go nowhere.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWith the recent crisis in our nation surrounding police impropriety, violence and even murder, is our nation ready for the re-popularization of the music that gave us the \"F-ck The Police!\" chant?Founder One Church LA, Executive Director of Artist Resource Center (ARC)Wmen ask me all the time about what they\u0027re supposed to do about the men out there who say they only want younger women in their profiles.

Social Security provides protection in all three eventualities - death, disability, and old age.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksWhat has been evident from the transfer window this summer is that the Premier League\u0027s so-called \u0027smaller clubs\u0027 can now afford to splash the cash, benefitting from the lucrative TV rights deal.

Well, these family-friendly dinners are all delicious and surprisingly quick to make. You can have them on the table in 30 minutes -- or less.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomTo campaign against Social Security is to court political suicide. (It certainly didn\u0027t help Alf Landon; he was trounced.) It therefore becomes imperative to convince voters instead that the program is unreliable. That\u0027s the Republican strategy.WriterAfter forty years of rising income and wealth inequality, some of America\u0027s rich seem worried that maybe things have gone too far.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyIt\u0027s a story so awful that even though my job involves constantly reading news about drug war atrocities, I avoided this one for days.Managing Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceMoral outrage is timeless. The BLM Movement needs to decide whether its principal strategic objective is to defeat, embarrass, or publicly disrupt the campaigns of those candidates running for president of the United States; or, instead, to engage them as a potential allies in its struggle to get our nation to finally acknowledge, 24/7, that Black Lives really Matter.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityAs advocates for economic justice, we should celebrate this event and its enduring legacy while striving to make UI work better for today\u0027s workers.

This week, on the 70th anniversary of Japan\u0027s defeat in World War II, tensions simmered as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once again stopped short of an apology for suffering Japan inflicted on innocent people. Meanwhile, a newly assertive China prepares for a reportedly unprecedented military display to mark the formal end of the war in early September.After repeated calls from the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury to let the market determine exchange rates, China this week devalued its currency. That, in turn, set off fears of beggar-thy-neighbor currency wars in a slack global economy. Taking this sudden move now, even as state intervention continues to prop up China\u0027s ailing stock market, has shaken confidence in the Communist Party\u0027s lauded ability to master events.
