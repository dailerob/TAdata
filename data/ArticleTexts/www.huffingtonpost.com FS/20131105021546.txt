{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowThe Battle of Fallujah epitomized the seeming impossibility of missions we ask our Marines to handle. About a year and half after our initial invasion, a group of violent resistance had integrated into one city -- Fallujah -- and the request of our Marines was that they drive, fly and walk into that city and do as little damage as possible to the buildings and its non-violent occupants, while confronting those hidden among them intent on killing Americans and Iraqis. This is a job very few among us would ever consider especially after reviewing the rules of engagement that restricted air support, rifle caliber and other nasty bits of the Marine Corps arsenal. Our leaders were telling us this was a \"nice\" war, remember?CommentsBarack ObamaPresident of the United StatesMillions of LGBT Americans go to work every day fearing that, without any warning, they could lose their jobs -- not because of anything they\u0027ve done, but simply because of who they are. It\u0027s offensive. It\u0027s wrong. And it needs to stop, because in the United States of America, who you are and who you love should never be a fireable offense.Comments (503)Brandon GorrellDirector of Editorial, Thought CatalogUsing energy from sunlight stored during daylight hours, glow-in-the-dark lane markers on roads will illuminate at night and communicate traffic information to drivers. Utilizing Dynamic Paint -- a coating that becomes visible in response to temperature fluctuations -- the road will be able to alert drivers of road conditions.CommentsColin ColemanManaging Director, Goldman Sachs International Inc.After almost two decades of democracy the world is asking: \"what has Nelson Mandela\u0027s South Africa done with its freedom?\" With the 95-year-old father of the nation ailing, the 52 million South Africans who see him almost universally as a hero are also asking what lies ahead long after \"Madiba.\"CommentsJenny WitteFounder and blogger, Mamatoga.comMy suggestion is to switch the focus from other moms, and what other moms are doing, to your own kids. Are your kids happy and healthy being co-sleeping french fry eaters? Awesome!Comments (71)Paul SlanskyWriter; Contributor to The New YorkerThere comes a time in every day when I think something like, \"I\u0027d love to live in a country where there\u0027s a machine that can measure your soul, and when someone -- someone, say, like a Ted Cruz, or a Michele Bachmann -- falls below a certain level of humanity, he or she is simply not allowed on TV.\"Comments (52)Steven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolExecutives refusing to waive Fourth Amendment rights would be fired (or not hired). If this seems draconian, recall that innocent New Yorkers who refuse to be Stopped and Frisked -- risk arrest and jail.Comments (121)Jill BrookeAuthor, \"The Need to Say No: How to be Bullish and Not Bullied\"Those who diminish others to raise their own status can no longer escape criticism because now there\u0027s a punitive label attached to it. In the current marketplace, being branded a bully is now taken more seriously in the boardroom, in the bedroom, on the football field in the school classroom.CommentsAmitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityIs Iran seeking to stretch out the negotiations to complete its bomb making or at least get to a point it can sprint to do so -- or merely out to do medical research and provide energy, as it claims? This question can be answered in short order by looking for \"smoking guns.\"CommentsErin RuberryManaging blog editor, The Huffington Post; Contributing editor, HuffPost DCAfter spending time in Scotland earlier this fall, I think I\u0027ve found the most beautiful castle in the world.Comments (36)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteCheck out the Milky Way next time you\u0027re outside the glare of city lights, and ruminate on the thought that at least 33 billion habitable planets are somewhere up there. But that\u0027s just the local population.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere\u0027s an old saying I learned during the early days of the feminist movement about women working together toward a common goal: \"One is a pest, two is a team, three is a coalition.\" I\u0027ve always liked that comment because it speaks directly to what I believe most deeply about women: that there\u0027s safety -- and power -- in numbers.CommentsHulu.comWatchers of Good TVThey\u0027ve lampooned the president, spoofed slavery, and even came up with a new take on \"yo mama\" jokes. They\u0027re Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, stars of Comedy Central\u0027s Key \u0026 Peele.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The more complex a system is, the more it is at risk of failing in complex ways that were not anticipated by its architects. It would be hard to imagine a more complicated way of expanding health coverage than the Affordable Care Act.Comments (753)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostThe public reaction to Macy\u0027s and Kohl\u0027s announcements that they plan to stay open for business on Thanksgiving was swift and disapproving. From the department stores\u0027 perspective, it\u0027s a matter of trying to squeeze an extra day out of the holiday shopping season and more money from our wallets. Meanwhile, the public is wringing its hands over how many workers will miss precious time with family.Comments (161)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorLois Gibbs did not shrug her shoulders and say \"I don\u0027t have the time or what difference would it make?\" when calamity struck her and her neighbors. It\u0027s easier than we think to start turning things around. We have to believe so and show up.CommentsYouyoung Lee and Aaron TimmsIf you haven\u0027t seen the most recent episode of \"Homeland,\" close this browser right now. If you have: WHOA.Comments (71)Kenneth R. MillerProfessor of biology, Brown UniversityThe crowd who managed to silence a speaker last week accomplished something, to be sure. But it wasn\u0027t a blow against racism, fascism or police oppression. It was a step towards a closed campus where mob rule determines who can speak and who will be shouted down.Comments (219)Samantha Boardman MDPsychiatrist, Writer and Blogger www.PositivePrescription.comProductive people know that mornings are a great time for getting things done. And science shows that willpower is greatest in the morning. So take advantage of it and do the things that require self-discipline, like going to the gym or doing your taxes, early in the day.Comments (31)Joan AlkerExecutive Director, Georgetown University Center for Children and FamiliesEven if we stipulate that adding people to an existing program is easier than setting up a new system of coverage, comparing Medicaid enrollment to exchange enrollment at this point in time is not even close to an apples to apples comparison. Here is why.Comments (92)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsLarry TrackFitness Expert, Owner of Track FitnessFit is a lifestyle. It\u0027s about making the right choices on a daily basis. Shifting your mindset to make physical activity and healthy eating a natural choice will greatly affect your life. Here\u0027s what fit people do.Comments (80)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWashington\u0027s obsession with tax cuts and deficit reduction is distracting the American people from the slow dismantling of the social contract, and its devastating impact -- financial and otherwise -- on all but the wealthiest among us.Comments (40)Vivian Diller, Ph.D.Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027The good news? Guys have begun to see advantages to enhancing their appearance, a focus once considered outside their domain. The not-so-good news? Men may soon head down a perilous path that women have been traveling for decades.CommentsJoseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorIt\u0027s only a matter of time until the NSA capability begins targeting the left in this country, if it has not already. J. Edgar Hoover and Richard Helms did it in the 1960s and 1970s. There are no real safeguards in place that would prevent it from happening again.Comments (114)Jesse KornbluthEditor of HeadButler.comIf you\u0027re hoping to learn about the second gunman on the grassy knoll or the CIA\u0027s plot to kill Kennedy or the Mafia hitman, his new book -- and this interview -- will disappoint you.

He and his errant statements have become global punch lines, but is he truly to blame for his performance?CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWhat is really going on here is a combination of intentional insularity and ideological patronage. Instead of wanting to have their ideas tested and challenged by their clerks, the conservative Justices apparently want their law clerks to applaud and affirm their views.Comments (162)Roots of PeaceI\u0027m often asked what drives my work in the Middle East. I do it because I am a mother.CommentsChristopher ElliottAuthor, How to Be the World\u0027s Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle)My view of junk fees -- and, by the way, I\u0027m right about this -- is far more inclusive. If a fee isn\u0027t adequately disclosed, can\u0027t be adequately explained and generates enough outrage, let\u0027s call it what it is: junk.CommentsSearch for Common GroundIt is more complex than just a handful of people wearing costumes that other people don\u0027t like. It\u0027s about collective ignorance, privilege and trauma.CommentsJill Di DonatoAuthor of Beautiful Garbage: A Novel, and Professor of EnglishCan we just do away with the dreaded \u0027friends with benefits\u0027 term altogether? I don\u0027t like what it implies: 1) That unless you\u0027re having sex with me, my friendship is benefit-free. 2) That a Justin Timberlake film bears some relevance to my dating life.Comments (87)Jay Weston, 2013. 4.11Brett Gallaher, 2013. 4.11Jane Coxwell, 2013. 4.11Steve Mariotti, 2013. 4.11ReadWave, 2013. 4.11Anne Maxfield, 2013. 4.11Women \u0026 Co, 2013. 4.11Chris Weigant, 2013. 4.11Mark I.
