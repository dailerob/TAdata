{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"We finally found out the real problem with the mainstream media: They\u0027re agnostic on sanity. That\u0027s the only conclusion that can be drawn from the refusal of mainstream-media organizations to allow their employees to attend Jon Stewart\u0027s Rally to Restore Sanity. That\u0027s right, in a showdown between nonpartisan sanity and partisan madness, the traditional media have boldly decided to... not take a stand. This media groupthink explains a lot -- including why we find ourselves in a time and place in our country in which a rally to restore sanity is even necessary. Taking a stand for sanity is neither right nor left. It\u0027s reasonable. That\u0027s why HuffPost is providing buses for people who need a ride to the rally. At the moment, more than 10,000 people have signed up to allow us to drive them sane. Yes, that will be a lot of buses -- but there\u0027s a lot of sanity to restore.Read Post | CommentsJohann Hari, 10.14.2010Columnist for the London IndependentThis robot slaughter drags us into a terrible feedback loop, where the US launches more drone attacks to deal with jihadism, which makes jihadism worse, which prompts more drone attacks, which makes jihadism worse -- and on and on.Read Post | CommentsLorelei Kelly, 10.15.2010Director, New Strategic Security InitiativeThe Tea Party has pointed out how absent we\u0027ve been in building a common narrative about modern American citizenship.
