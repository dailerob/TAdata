{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Represent.UsChair of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions sits on the Board of Advisors of Represent.UsToday, millions of Americans will begrudgingly pay their taxes to a government that does not inspire confidence. With public trust in government at near historic lows, many Americans believe that their elected representatives don\u0027t care what the average citizen thinks. Unfortunately, they\u0027re right. But there is room for hope. More than a dozen new city and statewide anti-corruption campaigns are on the way in 2015 and 2016. There are more than 23,000 municipalities and 27 states where we can bypass entrenched local legislatures and put tough, new anti-corruption laws on the ballot, so citizens can vote on them directly, which means this movement isn\u0027t slowing down anytime soon.Google has committed so many abuses, over so many years, that it has hard to know where the European Commission should start. And, I believe, once the filing of complaints and litigation start, there will be additional complaints.Professor of Operations and Information Management at The Wharton SchoolIn the United States, African Americans are far more likely to be arrested for selling or possessing drugs, even though studies have shown that African Americans and whites use drugs at the same rate, and whites are actually more likely to sell drugs.U.S. Senator for New JerseyMore than 200 cities will see strikes today. Tens of thousands of people will join in and express their support. They are people like you.President, Service Employees International UnionYou really can buy anything in America in 2015 -- even things you would never guess in a million years that someone wanted to buy. Who knew, before this weekend, that if you donate enough money, you can even become a quasi-cop and go chasing down criminals and assorted poor people in your spare time? Is this an exceptional country or what?Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Below are excerpts from a piece that five of the 58 young Chibok women who escaped Boko Haram on April 14, 2014 wrote when I asked them to say what education means to them.President, the American University of Nigeria (AUN)Through a myriad of tax avoidance schemes, the wealthy 1 percent continue to profit using public resources, subsidies and infrastructure while the 99 percent disproportionately pay the bills for it -- all while struggling to pay their own bills, mortgages, student loans, and more. Americans must ask why individual taxpayers are fronting the money for hugely profitable corporations.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorOn Tax Day, while working Americans contribute their part to keeping the country running, many companies that pay low-wages will exploit a loophole in the tax code that that allowed them to write off taxes on over $66 billion in executive compensation pay between 2007 and 2010.Policy Analyst, National Employment Law ProjectThis move truly designates Chile as a global leader in marine conservation. Chile has passed effective fishery regulations in the past -- like implementing science-based fishing quotas -- but a ban of this scale marks a truly historic move. Hopefully, other nations will soon follow Chile\u0027s footsteps, prohibiting bottom trawls around sensitive habitat.Actor; board member, OceanaI did not take her proclamation as a literal expression of hatred. For that, she’d have used a period, which in addition to its other functions has taken on the role of notating earnest textual anger.Books Editor, The Huffington PostI have a news tidbit for Beltway journalists: Latinos are not all the same. We actually are not Barbies, easily fitting into one another\u0027s costumes or convertibles or dream houses. And for the love of God, this particular Latina is getting mighty tired of being mistaken for Latinos I Am Not. Case in point: Marco Rubio.Associate Professor of English at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro; Fellow, Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, Harvard UniversityOur founding fathers were prescient in many ways, providing a system that had checks and balances designed to preserve liberty and ensure a peaceful and stable society. But the founding principle of this form of government is the consent of the governed. The gigantic role of money in our political system isn\u0027t what they had in mind.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterMy old agency director? He could have been imprisoned for what he said to me. That was almost 20 years ago, but I will never forget his words and their after effects.Writer, counselor, and bird-watcherIt was back to the edit room to update yet again a video that is heartbreakingly more relevant than ever. We can only pray that it will never need another revision. Sadly, we\u0027re pretty damn sure it will.Co-host, The HuffPost ShowCo-host, The HuffPost ShowAfter adopting legislation to sweep away NCLB\u0027s bad policy, the harder issue will be what should replace those provisions to bring about real, comprehensive improvement in American public schools? School improvement is necessary, but not for reasons commonly assumed.Founder, and former President, Center on Education PolicyTo this day my boobs are often on display as they continue to bring me nothing but joy. There is no doubt that I am cisgender. My son, on the other hand, had a very different experience. My son\u0027s breasts tortured him until the day they were surgically removed.Feisty physically disabled chick, proud mom, advocate, writer, coffee addict, cat lover, reality TV junkie, eternal optimistAs a faculty survivor activist in the new campus anti-rape movement, it is unsettling to witness the \"appalling silence of the good people,\" especially those who hold the greatest power to address the crisis: faculty members.Associate Professor of Politics at Occidental College in Los AngelesPuerto Rico, though it is not a state, has the privilege of issuing municipal bonds. Interest on those bonds is free from U.S. taxes. Typical municipal bonds pay 3 percent returns these days. But Puerto Rico\u0027s municipal bonds pay 8 percent or more.CEO, Professional Investor and Chairman, Intelligence Squared U.S. DebatesIt is in the interest of everyone, rich and poor, to see the minimum wage increased to at least $15 an hour. That will help not just minimum-wage workers. It will have a rippling effect, raising everyone\u0027s wages. And while we are at it, let\u0027s raise another significant part of everyone\u0027s compensation package. Let\u0027s raise Social Security.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksProfessor of Social Work, Syracuse UniversityThe \"fight for $15\" matters -- because the lives of working people matter, and because the success of this effort will help strengthen the American economy for everyone. But the significance of April 15\u0027s action runs even deeper than that.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourWho deserves a break more these days: a struggling working family, or the heir to a billion-dollar fortune? According to the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, it\u0027s the billion-dollar baby.Executive Director, Americans for Tax FairnessLet\u0027s be clear. No American citizen should be denied housing, the ability to attend school, to apply for a mortgage, or to serve on a jury because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.U.S. Representative for Rhode Island\u0027s First Congressional DistrictEnough of the indecent psychodrama surrounding Marine Le Pen and her father. Enough of the indulgent, sentimental, and voyeuristic commentary about the daughter \"sacrificing\" a poor King Lear, leaving him to rave on his moor in St. Cloud. And most of all, enough of the obscene political whitewashing that the entire affair has enabled. Because, after all, what is the reality?Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.It is sad and ironic that in this era when the mantra about accountability in education is mouthed repeatedly by policymakers, those who have the most authority accept no accountability for the system they have managed and created.Professor, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human DevelopmentHow long can we expect to see new reports and videos of unarmed black men being shot by police in incidents all across the country? Aspects of two of the most recent shootings in Tulsa, Okla. and North Charleston, S.C., suggest some answers to the question, and the answers do not bode well.Director, ACLU National Office\u0027s Racial Justice ProgramOur loophole-ridden corporate tax code creates winners and losers. The winners are a narrow set of large multinationals that boast armies of tax lawyers and accountants, and the losers are average taxpayers and small business owners who are left to foot the bill.Tax and Budget Associate, U.S. PIRGAs someone who has always shared her home with pets, I have come to develop a special relationship with the family veterinarian. She performed the first check up on Monty when we brought him home as a tiny puppy.Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer, PetplanWe are what we spend. If we let the Pentagon consume the largest part of our discretionary budget, then we give license to be defined in those terms. We will continue to address global problems with bombs rather than diplomacy. We should not be satisfied with that.Executive Director of WAND, Women\u0027s Action for New Directions. Win Without War co-chair.The reason most of us have seen little gain from economic growth over the last three decades is that the rich have rigged the rules to ensure that money flows upward.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Solutions are possible. Times have changed, but we haven\u0027t yet made the changes we need to ensure that women are paid more than spare change. In short, we are living in a Modern Family World with Mad Men workplace policies.Executive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgSince the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling five years ago, the influx of big money in politics has distorted Washington\u0027s ability to represent the people\u0027s interests over corporate interests.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"BANKBUSTER",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
