{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"With 36 days until the presidential election, I\u0027m delighted to introduce Firsthand, a project that uses all the tools at our disposal to expand the conversation, puts the spotlight on what really matters most in people\u0027s lives and allows you to share the ideas and images that tell the story of our country during this campaign season, as you see it. Every month, drawing on reader input, we will ask a broad question -- for example, how a certain challenge or trend is affecting your community. Using HuffPost’s platform, you\u0027ll then be able to share your response. It might be an Instagram photo with two sentences of explanatory text; a brief video clip; or a scan of a flyer that is landing on car windshields in your neighborhood. The result will be a vivid multimedia mosaic that captures the everyday events that are a testament to the changes underway in American communities.Read Post | Comments (80)Hillary Clinton, 10/01/12U.S. Secretary of StateWe want our progress to be transparent and want our partners to ask us hard questions. They can expect that we will do the same.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 09/30/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The other image Brown has carefully pursued is that of the last moderate Republican standing. But this is also hogwash, and it is the job of Warren and the press to dispatch that claim. If I were questioning Brown, here are some of the questions I\u0027d ask.Read Post | Comments (305)Jimmy Carter, 10/01/1239th president of the United StatesThe act of building, of renovating, of coming together cements a bond not easily undone. When we bring together available resources, take decisive action and advocate for lasting change, we build the kind of stability, that Haiti -- and we -- need.Read Post | Comments (105)Neil Katz, 10/01/12Executive News Editor, Huffington Post Media GroupMitt Romney\u0027s problem, other than saying something offensive to 47 percent of Americans every few days, is that he\u0027s running in the wrong party. Sounds crazy, but here\u0027s why.Read Post | Comments (245)Michelangelo Signorile, 10/01/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt surely isn\u0027t happening in this election cycle and may not happen in the next one, but Republicans could be reaching the end of the line on gay marriage and some conservative activists are even beginning to admit it.Read Post | Comments (320)Arianna Huffington, 09/30/12I\u0027m delighted to announce that today we launch JobRaising, which will help job-creating nonprofits raise money, raise awareness and help put Americans back to work.Read Post | Comments (148)Michael Moore, 10/01/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorFrom the start, Bain Capital had support from the government. We all built that. Just don\u0027t ever mention that in public.Read Post | Comments (370)Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, 10/01/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyMitt Romney\u0027s at it again -- shading the truth on CBS News\u0027 60 Minutes. He\u0027s perpetuating the false Republican narrative that President Obama should have gotten more done during his first two years in office because he had a supermajority in the Senate.Read Post | Comments (358)Michael Hogan and Christopher Rosen, 10/01/12Hey, Mike: Another week, another favorite? \"Life of Pi\" premiered at the New York Film Festival on Friday and thrust itself into the Oscar conversation with the force of a Bengal tiger attacking a villainous hyenaRead Post | CommentsChristina Wilkie, 10/01/12Staff Reporter, The Huffington PostI\u0027ve been reporting on the MEK for The Huffington Post since last summer, and members of the group have threatened my house and hacked my email. Still, I believe the State Department\u0027s decision Friday to remove the MEK from the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations was a good one.Read Post | Comments (13)Lee A. Saunders, 10/01/12President, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIORichard Hayes gets to work at 6 each morning to keep the neighborhood beautiful. He works a second job late in the day. He is just one of the many workers who Mitt Romney doesn\u0027t see and doesn\u0027t respect who are toiling long and hard in his community to provide vital public services.Read Post | Comments (82)James Franco, 10/01/12Actor and authorI am usually drawn to work that deals with the world of mass consumerism and popular culture. I find myself very attracted to work that uses the flashy opacity of fast food and modern living to critique and examine the way we live now.Read Post | CommentsDavid Paul, 10/01/12President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThe Romney that poked his head out of the ground last week was not the Romney that Republican activists presumed that they nominated. We saw glimpses once again of the Romney that once was -- and that Romney\u0027s primary opponents long warned against.Read Post | Comments (12)Gary Hart, 09/30/12President, Hart International, Ltd.Whether consciously or not, in deciding on a president we are really trying to decide who will protect our trust, the public trust, by standing on principle when the chips are down.Read Post | Comments (99)Edward Falzon, 10/01/12Author, \u0027Being Gay Is Disgusting\u0027 (a biblical parody)As long as we condemn a video before we condemn a violent reaction to it, we\u0027ll always be bestowing power upon those who wish to pass the kind of anti-blasphemy law being pitched at the UN.Read Post | Comments (13)Jill Smokler, 09/28/12Blogger, Scarymommy.com1. Mommy is on the phone right now, so let\u0027s entertain ourselves quietly.Read Post | Comments (89)William McGuinness, 10/01/12Senior Editor, Huffington Post CollegeWhen did I start? I\u0027ll spare you the details. Why do I do this at all, you ask? It\u0027s different and new. It\u0027s chilly! And for these reasons.Read Post | Comments (15)Cenk Uygur, 10/01/12Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027Here\u0027s my new favorite fact: whoever is leading two weeks after the last convention has never relinquished the lead in the last 15 presidential elections. It\u0027s way past two weeks since the last convention and President Obama doesn\u0027t have a small lead, he has a huge lead.Read Post | Comments (770)Nico Lang, 10/01/12Co-Creator and Co-Editor, In Our WordsAs gay parenting is the central subject of the show, The New Normal is (whether I like it or not) a landmark show, and how Murphy defines \"the new normal\" will matter to same-gender parents everywhere.Read Post | CommentsSayu Bhojwani, 10/01/12Founding Director, The New American Leaders ProjectAs in past years, the presidential debates on Wednesday are not designed to provide concrete or detailed policy proposals. But, at the least, we want to see more from our two presidential candidates than pandering to voters with baseline moral arguments around fairness and justice.Read Post | Comments (26)Chris Kelly, 10/01/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027No one wanted DIVX. It was just a wish list from the studios. But you can see why they tried it. \"I get everything and you get nothing\" isn\u0027t much of an proposition, but it\u0027s worth a shot. Mitt Romney\u0027s the same offer, in political terms.Read Post | Comments (42)John Pavley, 09/30/12CTO @ The Huffington Post, Mgt HckrWhile the iPhone 5 release is a devastating flub for Apple it\u0027s a fantastic opportunity for the rest of us.Read Post | Comments (132)Mattea Kramer, 10/01/12Senior Research Analyst, NPPFive big things will decide what this country looks like next year and in the 20 years to follow, but you\u0027re not going to hear about them in the upcoming presidential debates. And yet, on those five subjects, a little reality would go a long way.Read Post | Comments (32)Leo W. Gerard, 10/01/12International President, United SteelworkersRepublicans\u0027 reaction to last week\u0027s Monday Night Football debacle was record-breaking given their decades of hating on union workers.Read Post | Comments (244)Robert Reich, 09/30/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027If the payroll survey is significantly more than 96,000 -- the number of new jobs created in August -- President Obama can credibly claim the job situation is improving. If significantly fewer than 96,000, Mitt Romney has the more credible claim that the economy isn\u0027t improving.Read Post | Comments (220)Anne Zink, 2012.30.10Amelia, 2012. 1.10Mark Phillips, 2012. 1.10Rimjhim Dey, 2012. 1.10Hillary Clinton, 2012. 1.10Alexandra Pyke, 2012. 1.10Chon A.
