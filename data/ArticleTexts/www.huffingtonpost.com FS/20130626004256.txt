{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe Voting Rights Act of 1965, and amendments that followed through 2006, held that the states of the Old South, and a few other jurisdictions that had practiced official or “de jure” segregation, should be specifically and deeply scrutinized every time they tried to change their voting laws. The requirement for “preclearance” was based on voting and turnout patterns that, in turn, had their roots in segregation, Jim Crow and the practices that the South devised to disenfranchise blacks after the Civil War.The court said Tuesday that that history and those formulas are no longer relevant -- or at least not relevant enough to make sense in the multiracial America of today.Comments (760)Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectAs President Obama said today, history will judge the present generation by our success or failure in meeting and surmounting this existential challenge. So I urge the nation to follow President Obama\u0027s lead and take the positive steps he announced today, but to keep fighting.Comments (33)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m in Aspen for the inaugural 21st Century National Service Summit, sponsored by The Franklin Project, a new venture of the Aspen Institute. The goal is to make universal national service a new American rite of passage. It is, of course, an idea at the heart of the founding of the country itself, connected to the very \"pursuit of happiness\" in our Declaration of Independence.Comments (218)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkThis outrageous ruling puts African Americans, other minorities, the poor and all oppressed groups now at the mercy of state governments, yet again. It\u0027s as if we\u0027re in pre-1965 America.Comments (44)Martin GarbusTrial lawyer, authorThe court has now effectively struck down the Voting Rights Act. It is not likely that this partisan Congress can ever arrive at legislation that is fully committed to the preservation of the voting rights of all citizens.Comments (40)Rep. Earl BlumenauerU.S. Representative from OregonPresident Obama is right that we have a moral obligation to act, yet the Republicans\u0027 plan remains the same tired \"drill, baby, drill,\" which the American people know is a slogan, not a solutionCommentsCecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundGovernor Perry and friends are fast tracking a bill that would essentially end access to safe and legal abortion throughout the state -- but folks from El Paso to Texarkana are coming right back with their own message: not without a fight.Comments (40)Spencer OvertonProfessor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosVoting rights protections are still needed, and it is feasible to design up-to-date and adequate protections. While today\u0027s Supreme Court decision is a setback, Congress has the power to do the right thing and update the Voting Rights Act.Comments (19)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of Al Huffington Post Maghreb, a French-language edition of The Huffington Post covering the Maghreb countries -- Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria.Comments (188)Dustin Lance BlackFounding board member, American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER); Academy Award-winning screenwriter, \u0027Milk\u0027Tomorrow\u0027s Supreme Court decision on marriage equality isn\u0027t just political. Each of us has a very personal reason that our stomach is filled with butterflies today. Here\u0027s mine.Comments (15)Mitchell BardWriter and FilmmakerDon\u0027t get bogged down in the legal arguments offered by Roberts. The legal argument is an excuse to allow business conservatives to undo a key piece of legislation that did huge work in giving more Americans the power to vote, but made it harder for business conservatives to win elections.Comments (47)Michael BruneExecutive Director, The Sierra ClubIs everything in the Climate Action Plan workable -- or even a good idea to begin with? Of course not. On balance, though, the plan offers a way for our nation to move forward strongly.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWe encourage universities to more fully document the factual necessity of their plans and the reasons why some limited consideration of race in a holistic review process is the only practical way to achieve the diversity they think necessary to serve compelling educational interests.CommentsSoraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderJust when I thought nothing could get more ridiculous than last week\u0027s \"masturbating male fetus\" rights argument to justify extreme anti-abortion rhetoric, this happened: Rep. Jodie Laubenberg explained, \"In the emergency room they have what\u0027s called rape kits where a woman can get cleaned out.\"Comments (227)Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsWhat happened in Albany last week has major implications for national anti-corruption efforts that are central to making progress on the issues that you care about most, yet keep losing. Health care, climate change, education, financial oversight, military spending... the list goes on.Comments (290)Sean McElweeWriterThere\u0027s no excuse for America to continue on the road of inequality. Plenty of other countries have managed to grow quickly without drastic inequality. Inequality is bad for democracy, health, safety, social cohesion and social mobility. Let\u0027s not let anyone sugarcoat it.CommentsSteve StraussBest-selling author, USA TODAY columnist, leading small business expert. Visit www.TheSelfEmployed.comBusiness majors are fine, but they are preoccupied with theory, proving themselves, and doing it \"right.\" But the English majors are used to getting a tough assignment, figuring it out, and getting it done, (usually) on time.Comments (470)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureOur democracy was under siege even before the Supreme Court\u0027s ruling on the Voting Rights Act. It\u0027s a mistake to view this decision in isolation. It\u0027s part of an ongoing, corporate-backed constitutional coup.CommentsFrances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilPresident Obama has announced a robust plan for tackling climate change and reducing dangerous carbon pollution. This marks an historic turning point.CommentsErnest OwensCommunication \u0026 Public Service scholar, University of PennsylvaniaBlackness is not a trend or a fad. What \"feels black\" is as versatile and subjective as the number of outfits, hairstyles, and jewels you use to cover up your identity, Miley Cyrus.Comments (120)Philip RadfordExecutive Director, GreenpeaceToday, in his speech at Georgetown University, President Obama challenged us to answer the essential question for every future energy policy decision we face -- what will the net climate impact be if this project goes forward?CommentsShirley Sagawa and John BridgelandIt is time to use 21st century strategies to create a national service certification system open to any 501(c)3 nonprofit, public agency, tribal government, or social enterprise. With such a system, the number of Americans officially performing \"national service\" could double, triple, or quadruple within a few years. National service could become deeply embedded in our culture and a rite of passage for millions.CommentsAri MelberMSNBC Co-Host, AttorneyIn Shelby County v. Holder, Chief Justice John Roberts\u0027 opinion is a model of extremism pitched as incrementalism.CommentsDavid WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\u0027To me, Edward Snowden just seems like a narcissistic creep who wants to be a star on the global stage. But rest assured that would never stop me from making the man a playlist that\u0027s perfect for long trips from Moscow to Ecuador in the company of Wikileaks lawyers.Comments (74)Phaedra Ellis-LamkinsCEO, Green for AllSimultaneously, an effective climate plan must also include measures that will protect Americans who are most vulnerable right now. While the pollution that causes climate change threatens all of us, low-income communities and people of color are hit first and worst.CommentsTimothy P. ShriverChairman and CEO, Special OlympicsBy any name, it is a force. It is the most powerful means of social and political and cultural change ever discovered. It always starts when the desire to be part of something bigger meets the power to make a difference in something very small. Once unleashed, it cannot be stopped.CommentsKader A. AbderrahimEditorial Director, Al Huffington Post MaghrebAl Huffington Post Maghreb is a news website with a dual purpose: to deliver \"hot\" news, occurring every day, happy or sad, serious or light-hearted. We will do this with ambition and professionalism, while seeking a unique approach to make this information more attractive.CommentsGreta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027I think the political party leadership in both parties should be worried -- the Tea Party comes from both political parties and is growing and it packs a punch.Comments (36)Michael SolisWriter and development worker in Latin AmericaThe following are 10 strategies geared toward heterosexual men and women, who are key to dismantling forms of communication that invisibilize LGBT people. The catch is that a few of them require straight people to step outside the heteronormative comfort zone and pretend to be gay.CommentsSusan DanishExecutive Director, The Association of Junior Leagues International Inc.We agree that there is enormous potential value in creating an expanded national service model that harnesses the energy of young and old citizens alike to help solve pressing societal issues, ranging from children\u0027s welfare to adult literacy to public health. But one size does not necessarily fit all.CommentsRebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027What do the U.S. government and Silicon Valley already have in common? Above all, they want to remain opaque while making the rest of us entirely transparent through the capture of our data.CommentsMia Norton, 2013.25.06Michelle Chen, 2013.25.06David Finkle, 2013.25.06Jared Feldschreiber, 2013.25.06Brad Johnson, 2013.25.06Geoffrey R.
