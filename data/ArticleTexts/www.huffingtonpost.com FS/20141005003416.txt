{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Spouse Calls, Stars and StripesWhen the Secretary of Defense reiterates \"no boots on the ground,\" military families like mine don\u0027t breathe a sigh of relief alongside the rest of America. We know too much. Even without a stated combat mission against terrorist organizations overseas, we know our loved ones and their boots are already in ships, airplanes, and yes, even on the ground. More are likely to follow, to train and support indigenous forces. Whether the Pentagon calls it a combat mission or boots on the ground won\u0027t matter much to those doing the job and wearing the boots. Call them advisers, trainers or support personnel. They\u0027ll do what the mission requires. Their families will hold the fort at home, knowing terminology won\u0027t matter much either to enemies who\u0027ve shown they have few scruples regarding human life.I\u0027m a business strategist and from where I\u0027m looking, the game has changed dramatically in the past 50 years. Talent has become the critical force in the economic equation, more important than either raw materials and labor, and a worthy if not overwhelming adversary for capital.Author, \u0027Fixing the Game\u0027This Israeli fantasy of making peace with the Arabs without first making peace with the Palestinians has been around for decades. It is, in effect, a desire to turn the Arab Peace Initiative on its head. As is often the case, Netanyahu\u0027s clever, but disingenuous, ploys can\u0027t stand up in the face of reality.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027One of these guys is very wrong, and neither one delivered any real context to their analyses. Each view is a kind of cartoony boardwalk caricature of the president, rather than an accurate portrayal of the real-life leader.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027These decisions are a significant turnabout from a month ago, when Turkey seemed reluctant to get involved. What is driving the AKP to join the American effort against ISIL?Professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History, University of MichiganNeither the Justice Department nor the White House Counsel has backed up Obama\u0027s bare war-making assertion with a serious legal opinion.Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027The ocean covers 45 percent of the planet, produces almost half of all the oxygen we breathe and sequesters more than a quarter of the CO2 we emit into the atmosphere. It is, in essence, the kidneys of our planet, keeping systems healthy, giving life -- and there is no way to put it on dialysis.Founder, Virgin GroupI spoke to James K. Boyce about his research and the impact of environmental inequality on politics, education, economics, and the shape of our society.AlterNet Editor; Co-founder, Recessionwire; Founding Editor of New Deal 2.0For the past week, the commercial arteries of Hong Kong have been clogged with (mostly) student demonstrators clamoring for \"democracy.\" What is the end game here? I predict resolution, albeit one unsatisfying to most Westerners as well as a minority of Hong Kong citizens who aspire an American brand of democracy.CEO, JWT Asia PacificIt\u0027s becoming increasingly apparent some new Koch Brothers are on the loose in Washington. Like the Brothers K, they got rich on filthy fossil fuel revenues, and are using their booty to buy up think tanks, lobbyists and the best law firms. They\u0027re tossing some of the nation\u0027s top liberal institutions into their shopping carts, too.Investigative journalist and authorFans of market forces for education simply don\u0027t understand how market forces actually work. What they like to say is that free market competition breeds excellence. It does not, and it never has.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comChildren are not sexual. Exposed skin is not sexual. Children with exposed skin are not sexual. Children are children.www.PicklesInk.comThe sheer scale of free speech today is without precedent; more people than ever before are able to connect and communicate. Going forward, these Internet users need common-carrier rules, as much as the First Amendment, to protect this most democratic right.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressWhile no one would wish for it to be vaulted to the forefront of daily conversation in the way it was, we, nonetheless, have an unprecedented opportunity to educate men and women, young and old, about boundaries and alternatives to violence.Philanthropist, Author, EntrepreneurPredictably, this one case diagnosed here in the U.S. has resulted in a media feeding frenzy, rumination, recrimination, and the familiar blend of hyberbole and hysteria that tends to populate those infamous 15 minutes during which any given crisis holds our attention.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterIt\u0027s almost Yom Kippur and for those of you who are fasting, I can imagine the whining by four o\u0027clock. \"I\u0027m hungry. Yikes this is hard.\" It actually is kind of hard not to eat for a day and I am not in awe of people who go on prolonged cleansing fasts, as I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s actually good for you.oneforthetable.comThe last time the unemployment rate was below 6 percent was in July 2008. Moreover, while the labor force fell slightly (though statistically insignificantly) last month, the decline in the jobless rate over the past year has come for the \"right\" reason: more people finding work, not leaving the job market.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs an independent consultant I appreciated the autonomy my business afforded me and enjoyed coaching others in my area of expertise of wellbeing and performance. And here I was lying helpless, injured and traumatized.Entrepreneur, author, international business consultant and coachThe second week of early voting has ended and 88,371 people have voted in all reporting states, with 31 days to go until Election Day on Nov. 4. Early vote should easily eclipse 2010 in absolute terms, and likely signals higher overall turnout.Associate Professor, University of FloridaOnline dating has made me feel more alone and rejected than ever.Just because an event hasn\u0027t been positively \"attributed\" to climate change in a formal \"detection and attribution\" study does not preclude speaking about the role climate change may have played, when the event is (a) consistent with expectations in a warming world, and (b) part of a larger trend.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027In my case, obesity was a symptom, and not the problem itself. I wish someone had told me before I had gastric bypass surgery that my real issues were shame and addiction. Getting thin wasn\u0027t my solution -- it was what made me miserable enough to finally get well.Personal Trainer, Coach, BloggerAnd every time the NRA has a week as bad as this one, the American public wins.President of Everytown for Gun SafetyIf this story is actually what I believe it to be, a wake-up call from the universe, men will stop making excuses, women will stop being angry, and people will start talking and healing the things that really matter: relationships, families and our collective investment in the future of this world.Spiritual Life Coach, NY Times Best-Selling AuthorIn order to rank these deals, we focused on not only the selection of food served, but also the value you\u0027re receiving for your money and the length of availability. But should you decide to take any of these chains up on their offer, remember the one cardinal rule of all-you-can-eat dining: don\u0027t fill up on the bread.TheDailyMeal.comWhile the idea of believers being \"caught up in the air\" is mentioned, it is metaphorically describing the Second Coming. Paul is not claiming, nor even implying that Christians will disappear before all hell breaks loose on earth. In fact, the very idea of the rapture is antithetical to the narrative of scripture.Writer, Blogger, \u0026 SpeakerIf I have gay children, I\u0027ll love them. I don\u0027t mean some token, distant, tolerant love that stays at a safe arm\u0027s length. It will be an extravagant, open-hearted, unapologetic, lavish, embarrassing-them-in-the-school cafeteria, kind of love.Irreverent, Relevant, and Revealing RabbiIn Berlin, public anger over data collection runs deeper than I expected. Unlike in the United States, wariness of how the government uses personal information affects the way many people interact with technology in daily life.Arthur F. Burns Fellow in BerlinMisplaced diagnostic exuberance has turned age-appropriate immaturity into a psychiatric disease and treats it with a pill, rather than just letting the kid grow up.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityI\u0027m constantly witnessing ways in which my toddler son is getting less than his older sister did. And yet, despite the outward appearance of deprivation, I\u0027m discovering that the things he\u0027s missing aren\u0027t as important as I thought.Author, blogger at MommyAtoZBlog.comJesus was clearly a Marxist, not by name, but by ideology. He sought tirelessly to end poverty, to feed and house the needy and to heal those in need.Author of Parenting Without GodGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"REPORT: ISIS NEARS BAGHDAD",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
