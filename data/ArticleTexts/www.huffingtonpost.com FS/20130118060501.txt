{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureF. Scott Fitzgerald warned, \"There are no second acts in American lives.\" And for recent American presidents, second acts have been brutal. The hope of the first act succumbs to the karmic reckonings of the second. Nixon cast out by his crimes in Watergate. Reagan laid low by his Iran Contra follies. Clinton shamed from his personal excesses. Bush Jr. ostracized after Iraq, Katrina and economic calamity stripped away his strut. Can Barack Obama avoid that reckoning? In the wake of the Great Recession, in a country scarred by extreme inequality, a sinking middle class, spreading poverty, and a corrupted politics, can the president define and rally Americans to embrace a new foundation for growth and shared prosperity?Read Post | Comments (240)John Mackey, 01/17/13CEO, Whole Foods MarketI believe that, if the goal is universal health care, our country would be far better served by combining free enterprise capitalism with a strong governmental safety net for our poorest citizens and those with preexisting conditions, helping everyone to be able to buy insurance.Read Post | Comments (658)Bob Cesca, 01/17/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowGlenn Beck is building an amusement park called -- what else? -- Independence Park. But he\u0027s pitching it to be much more than a roadside tourist trap with a tilt-a-whirl, concessions and skeeball. Beck wants his herd of followers to believe it\u0027s a real city -- his own version of Ayn Rand\u0027s \"Galt\u0027s Gulch.\"Read Post | Comments (346)Ian Bremmer, 01/17/13Author, \u0027Every Nation for Itself\u0027We live in a global political order that has become unmoored from the underlying trend of U.S.-led globalization. We have much less of a single moral guidepost and leaders are finding it increasingly difficult to act on their moral sensibilities.Read Post | Comments (118)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 01/17/13Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureJohn Mackey\u0027s politics are bad for Whole Foods -- not just because opinions may drive customers away, but because his proposals would hurt his corporation\u0027s profitability.Read Post | Comments (119)Morgan Lorraine Roach and Luke Coffey, 01/16/13Halting the advance of Islamist militants in Mali is not the same has defeating them. Now that France has committed itself to the crisis, Hollande will need to better define France\u0027s mission in Mali and outline how long French forces will remain there.Read Post | CommentsLisa Belkin, 01/16/13Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostJust as it is becoming clearer that this might be the start of real change, it is also clear what is making it so: this one is about parents and children.Read Post | Comments (586)Joseph A.

In the process, the sports media complex has appropriated for itself the mantle of moral arbiter.Read Post | Comments (13)Rev. Al Sharpton, 01/17/13President, National Action NetworkAs we move forward with the president\u0027s executive orders and with his second term in office, it\u0027s vital that the rest of us highlight and immediately denounce the sort of dangerous language that Sen.

Throughout the years, we\u0027ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly. Sometimes, we look back and say to ourselves, \"What was I thinking?\" This year is no different.

Boyd Jr., 01/17/13Fourth-generation farmerWhat are you hunting that requires the need of a semi-automatic weapon -- an instrument used for military warfare? This defies common sense and it should be central during the gun debate. This kind of extremism is part of the reason I do not have an NRA membership.Read Post | Comments (439)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 01/16/13CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOPaul Krugman is right: Japan is attempting a paradigm policy shift with potential systemic implications; and sustainability and success are not certain.
