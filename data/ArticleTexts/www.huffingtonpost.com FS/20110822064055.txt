{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This summer, with all of HuffPost\u0027s new launches and international expansions, I\u0027ve had no time for a \"traditional\" vacation. So I created my own vacation here at home, with weekend massages, facials, yoga classes, and explorations of my new neighborhood. I realized, for example, that I live just blocks from the High Line, New York\u0027s magnificent park set on a former elevated train track. Or, tucked away on a small street, the Cherry Lane Theatre, where I just saw a beautiful new play, Manipulation. Then, Cafe Cluny, where I discovered the best pistachio ice cream -- better than any pistachio gelato in Capri. I made a conscious effort to see my home neighborhood with fresh eyes and those nuggets of rich local history were my immediate reward. All in all, my travel-less vacation has been a lovely reminder that when it comes to travel, the journey to knowledge and adventure need not be long.Read Post | CommentsAmb.
