{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, USC Marshall School, and author of \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Childhood Denied\u0027Given Obama\u0027s hemming and hawing about appointing Warren, it\u0027s not far-fetched to think that history could repeat itself. Another woman trying to break the old guard\u0027s economic chokehold could be shown the door. If the financial overseers do pull a \"Brooksley Born\" on Warren, they will be overestimating their power and underestimating both the acumen and the power of Americans who supported President Obama in the past. They will also be turning their backs on those striving to join the middle class and those struggling to remain there.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 09.13.2010While America was preparing to burn Qurans for 9/11 Day, NPR went out and found the missing oil. Three guesses where they found it!Read Post | CommentsEd Kilgore, 09.13.2010Managing Editor of The Democratic StrategistIt\u0027s been a long and fascinating primary season, with most of the heavy action on the GOP side, and that\u0027s largely how it will culimate with tomorrow\u0027s eight-primary event.Read Post | CommentsMarty Kaplan, 09.13.2010Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolThe loser in the lead-up to November is any political figure who believes that Americans truly are sick and tired of negative campaigning and bitter partisanship, which is what Americans always say, but which usually results in winning elections.Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 09.13.2010Author, Political Commentator, and Blogger (ChrisWeigant.com)Anyone in the media talking about raising income tax rates on the top two income brackets should disclose their possible conflict of interest. \"Full disclosure, I fall into the top tax bracket myself, so I would personally be affected by changing this rate.\"Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 09.13.2010Professor of Literature at YalePresident Obama has yet to develop a consistent clarity in the explanation of his policies: an ability that is tested in open debate and unrehearsed exchanges more than in the formats of the prepared speech and the polite interview.Read Post | CommentsJanet Tavakoli, 09.13.2010President, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe American money cartel is as dangerous as the Mexican drug cartel. Wall Street is winning the class war, and taxpayers supplied its weapons of choice: PR spin, lobbying, the money train to Congress, and constant bullying.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 09.13.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureAmericans need ways to process all the information they\u0027re receiving. They\u0027re struggling with the cognitive dissonance they experience when they\u0027re told the economy\u0027s doing better, because they know that in their world it\u0027s not.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 09.13.2010Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchAmerica\u0027s problem is that because of bad policy we don\u0027t have enough demand in the economy for jobs. If there is a mismatch of jobs and skills it is between economist positions and the people who fill them.Read Post | CommentsKevin Zeese, 09.11.2010Executive Director of VotersForPeace.US and ProsperityAgenda.USLast week every former U.S. DEA head came out against Proposition 19 -- no surprise there. But voters should ask themselves: Has the marijuana war, with more than 800,000 arrests each year, worked?Read Post | CommentsWilliam Bradley, 09.13.2010California-based Political Analyst NewWestNotes.comIt doesn\u0027t look like Matt Weiner is much of a Beatles fan. We\u0027ve had Bob Dylan, the Beach Boys, and now the Rolling Stones ... but the lads from Liverpool have been relegated to Christmas gifts for Don\u0027s kids bought by his former secretary.Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 09.13.2010Scholar in Residence at the University of ColoradoWhat are thoughtful people to do when the men, and women, who buy ink by the barrel use an unconscionable amount of it to \"report\" on a minister in Florida for the simple reason that he threatened to burn a Quran?Read Post | CommentsCandy Spelling, 09.13.2010AuthorIt is said there are no coincidences or irony in Hollywood, so I\u0027ll just say it\u0027s interesting that today\u0027s Hollywood trades are making news themselves, rather than reporting other show business news.Read Post | CommentsKathy Kelly, 09.13.2010Co-coordinator of Voices for Creative NonviolenceIn Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and other areas where the U.S. routinely kills civilians, the actual killing seems distant. We grow so accustomed to our remote roles that we hardly notice the rising antagonism caused by U.S. aerial attacks.Read Post | CommentsMarshall Auerback, 09.13.2010Roosevelt Institute Senior FellowRational discourse about fiscal policy is not helped when our Secretary of State begins espousing the notion that our deficit represents a security threat, along the lines of a financial bubonic plague or comparable to a terrorist threat.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 09.12.2010Co-founder and co-editor of The American ProspectObama has insisted that the Bush era tax cuts, which expire this year, be extended for \"only\" about 98 percent of Americans, but not for households making over $250,000 a year. Hard to argue with that, but watch the GOP try.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 09.13.2010Rabbi and writerHow did an attention-seeking nonentity with barely enough Church followers to fill a phone booth become an international personality and provoke a global furor?

Even more, they are thrilling -- for Marie de Hennezel, a French psychologist, spent years \"accompanying\" the dying on their path toward death.Read Post | CommentsDylan Loewe, 09.13.2010Speechwriter, Author of Permanently BlueThere\u0027s no question that Republicans are benefiting from having redistricting occur after the November election and not before it. But there is a difference between being better off and being in good shape.Read Post | CommentsEddie Glaude, Jr., Ph.D., 09.13.2010Professor of Religion and Chair of the Center for African American Studies at Princeton UniversityPresident Obama has become our national scapegoat. Americans are good at exorcising demons, in order to affirm our inherent goodness, but we find it terribly difficult to look directly at ourselves in the mirror.Read Post | CommentsAnthony Tjan, 09.13.2010CEO of Cue Ball and Vice Chairman of ParthenonThere used to be a time when you could go to have a lunch or dinner with someone and you could have, well, lunch or dinner. During that lunch or dinner you could reasonably expect uninterrupted conversation.Read Post | CommentsSen. Tom Harkin, 09.13.2010Democratic Senator from IowaThis week, Sen. Mike Johanns is due to offer an amendment to the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act that could effectively kill the Prevention and Public Health Fund. This would be a grave mistake.Read Post | CommentsAlan Dershowitz, 09.13.2010Criminal and civil liberties lawyerThe time has come for the entire international community to recognize that the greatest single barrier to real peace and stability in the Middle East is not the Israeli-Arab conflict, but rather the threat posed by a nuclear Iran.Read Post | CommentsEtan Thomas, 09.13.2010NBA Player, Atlanta HawksWhen it comes down to it, who is looking out for the troops\u0027 best interest? They deserve more than simple praise. They deserve to be told the truth about why in fact they went to war in the first place.Read Post | CommentsNick Turse, 09.13.2010Associate Editor, TomDispatch.comAs the US approaches the tenth anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan, pundits chew over just what \"success\" in Afghanistan might mean for Washington. What success might mean for ordinary Afghans hasn\u0027t been a topic of conversation.Read Post | CommentsBob Samuels, 09.13.2010President, University Council - AFTThe great magic trick in this era of joblessness and historic inequality is that the Republican party has actually convinced many Americans that the real threat to their economic survival comes from the poor and the middle-class.Read Post | CommentsRobert Weller, 2010.09.14Eric Ehrmann, 2010.09.13Andy Stepanian, 2010.09.13StyleCaster, 2010.09.13Roger Catlin, 2010.09.13Jamie Henn, 2010.09.13Mary Hall, 2010.09.13Marissa Bronfman, 2010.09.13Candy Spelling, 2010.09.13Linda Constant, 2010.09.13","h1":"Using a mobile device?
