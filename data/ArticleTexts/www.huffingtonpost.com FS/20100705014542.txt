{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Happy 4th of July! This week, the House authorized an additional $30 billion to fund the war in Afghanistan. Any time the funding of jobs programs or unemployment benefits is raised, our leaders immediately go into sticker shock. But they don\u0027t bat an eye when it\u0027s time to sign the next check for our wars of choice in Afghanistan and Iraq (2010 price tag: $161 billion). We are letting the American Dream die here at home while pursuing military adventures abroad that ultimately leave our nation less safe. To highlight this red, white, and blue tragedy, Robert Greenwald has put together this powerful video, and our HuffPost bloggers have weighed in. And don\u0027t miss Arthur Delaney\u0027s interview with the family of Marine Cpl. Jacob Leicht, the 1,000th U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan. Jacob was born on the 4th of July; he would have turned 25 today.Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 07.03.2010Scholar in Residence at the University of ColoradoHistory\u0027s road is littered with the wreckage of empires that tried to rule the world even as they were collapsing at home.

Gags about impossibly spicy food? I\u0027d never heard those before!Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 06.28.2010It\u0027s truly bizarre how many in Washington are describing the situation in Afghanistan accurately, but then fail to draw the most obvious conclusion based on what they\u0027ve just said.Read Post | CommentsDr. Jill Biden, 07.04.2010Second Lady of the United StatesMy husband Joe and I flew to Iraq to celebrate the Fourth of July with our troops.

Dianne Feinstein, 07.01.2010U.S. Senator from California.At a time of great hardship for many Americans, it is unconscionable that a few mega-corporations can simply misplace a few decimal points and quickly rack up millions of dollars in unjust profits.Read Post | CommentsCraig \"Meathead\" Goldwyn, 07.01.2010Barbecue Whisperer, Hedonism EvangelistWave the flag, light the sparklers, and start the grill.

She\u0027s just a creep. Jerry Brown was obviously talking about Whitman\u0027s method of getting her message out, not the message itself, which isn\u0027t like Goebbels\u0027 at all.
