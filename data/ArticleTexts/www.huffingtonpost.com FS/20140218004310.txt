{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It is a staple of American history that the president\u0027s party loses seats six years into his term. Voters are weary of the incumbent and receptive to change. In the past century, even the beloved Franklin Roosevelt lost seats in his sixth year, 1938, before going in to win two more terms. The circumstances are far from auspicious and the stakes could hardly be higher. Democrats hold the Senate by a margin of 55-45, counting the two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Only Democratic control of the Senate has allowed President Obama to win some key victories over the Republican House, including the recent increase in the debt ceiling and some relief from the budget sequester, as well as forcing through some confirmations of presidential nominees. What are the odds that Barack Obama and the Democrats will beat the odds, and what might they do to improve their chances?Comments (137)Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghA feature of the Obama presidency has been his campaign against the American public school system, eating way at the foundations of elementary education. That means the erosion of an institution that has been one of the keystones of the Republic.Comments (17)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersA study released last month shows what each state will lose in federal funding by rejecting the Medicaid expansion. No state that refused to expand Medicaid will save money, the researchers found.Comments (55)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarStudies have long challenged the idea that nice guys finish first. So is Fallon an anomaly? Or does he represent a shift in the balance of power between the tyrants and the team players?CommentsRev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryOf what value is the soul of an African American teenager? Today, in America, it seems like there is not an equality of souls, of human beings, especially when it comes to the lives of young African American men.Comments (43)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsLet\u0027s celebrate Presidents Day this year -- by honoring women who paved the way. And who knows? 2016 could be our lucky number.Comments (43)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWill he or won\u0027t he reprise the \"chained CPI\" cut to Social Security that he proposed in last year\u0027s budget? Nobody on his team is talking. The answer to that question could determine the financial fate of millions of Americans -- and the political fate of the president\u0027s party.CommentsDavid FontanaAssociate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.Sometimes we need a reason to feel better, and that reason lies in upstate New York. Politics is highly imperfect even there, but politics are better there. The voters, their political parties, and their elected officials have kept politics local, and have made politics work.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhether it is Florida or any of the other 22 states with these ridiculous and incomprehensible laws on the books, we must push back aggressively and immediately.Comments (13)Elizabeth DrewJournalistIt\u0027s possible that criminal charges will be brought against Christie or his aides. But much larger questions are before officials of New Jersey and the federal prosecutors investigating the various charges against Christie and his subordinates and allies.Comments (48)Michael RussnowScreenwriter; former member, WGAW Board of Directors; former U.S. Senate aideFor all these reasons, and not just one, I\u0027m going against the grain of what appears to be the general consensus and strongly suggest that Leonardo DiCaprio deserves the Oscar this year for The Wolf of Wall Street, even more than favorite Matthew McConaughey.Comments (15)Matt YoderManaging Editor, Awful AnnouncingAfter the interview, there has been a firestorm of criticism aimed at Christin Cooper with the general consensus that she was going to keep pressing Miller until he cried on the air.Comments (11)Ellen PageActressI\u0027m here today because I am gay. And because... maybe I can make a difference. To help others have an easier and more hopeful time. Regardless, for me, I feel a personal obligation and a social responsibility. I also do it selfishly, because I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission.Comments (41)Thomas A. FosterAuthor\"The Founding Fathers were all virgins!\" Yes, the usual attention-grabbing headlines are about sexual dalliances but why not consider this possibility?CommentsJonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillDunn\u0027s lawyer, Cory Strolla, insisted that the trial was not about race, but instead about a \"subculture thug issue.\" But what work is \"thug\" doing here, other than to dehumanize a group of young men for the purposes of devaluing their lives in order to justify ending them?CommentsBishop Minerva G. CarcañoBishop in The United Methodist ChurchWe call upon President Obama to stop the deportations. Show mercy and compassion. Show us courage. Show us Presidential leadership on this President\u0027s Day.CommentsPeter Van BurenAuthor, \u0027We Meant Well\u0027 and the upcoming \u0027Ghosts of Tom Joad, A Story of the #99Percent\u0027It\u0027s still possible to remember, almost nostalgically, how the Fifth Amendment used to guarantee Americans due process. The key phrase was indeed that \"due process.\"CommentsFrank RobertsFord Foundation Fellow, New York UniversityWhat we wanted to believe was that America was ready to make good on its word. We wanted young black boys and girls to believe that that the phrase \"liberty and justice for all\" applied to them too.CommentsDamona HoffmanHost of \"Dates \u0026 Mates\" Radio ShowSince it seems that many people have no idea what is appropriate to say to a pregnant woman, I\u0027ve written a few guidelines based on the comments that sent me home crying over my last two pregnancies.Comments (12)Johann KossPresident and CEO of Right To PlaySport and play are our instincts and a human need. Events like the Olympics show us sport\u0027s ability to transcend our differences and unite us -- both in victory and defeat. Athletes are the carriers of that power.CommentsRandi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersLet\u0027s do a mini-lesson in critical thinking. Here\u0027s a glossary of programs that many lawmakers love to hate. Let\u0027s examine whether they are a drain on or a benefit to individuals, their families and our communities.Comments (48)Joe SestakDad; Former Congressman; 3 Star Admiral; Director, Defense Policy, Director, Navy Anti-TerrorismWhat we\u0027re missing today is pragmatic leadership where leaders are willing to say, \"Here\u0027s where we are, here\u0027s what I think we have to do based on the facts, here\u0027s measurable benchmarks that we need to hit, and if we don\u0027t, hold me accountable.\" So what are the facts?CommentsWayne BesenFounder, Truth Wins OutPeople have said that the harassment may have stopped had Martin used his 6\u00275\" 312 pound frame to body slam the bullies.

Over the years, this conflict transformed into unions against school administrations, the public against teachers, and Democrats against Republicans.CommentsJason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressEarlier this week, Politico\u0027s Byron Tau reported on the sad state of The Can Kicks Back, a deficit-hack outfit spun off of Fix The Debt, whose unique strategy in the \"OMG TEH DEFICITZ\" Wars was to attempt the enlistment of millenials in the effort to impoverish their grandparents.Comments (199)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThere is a deplorable and tragic common thread that ties together recent, global acts of oppression against LGBT people: Christian complicity.Comments (589)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThere is something desperate about the current quality of politics in Washington DC. It is not that our elected representatives steadily avoid any discussion of key issues. It is rather that the way in which they choose to discuss those key issues trivializes them to the point of folly.Comments (17)Brian ShactmanAnchor and reporter for MSNBCCold War or no Cold War, when Russia plays the United States in hockey, it\u0027s an event. When it\u0027s in the Olympics, it means more. When those Olympics are in Russia and the nation\u0027s president basically pins a nation\u0027s hopes on its hockey team, well, then it\u0027s intense.Comments (14)HuffPost RadioErick and Jonathan butt heads on the issues of the Debt Ceiling and Immigration. \"No path to citizenship -- no GOP path to the White House.\" But the two then find consensus on NFL gay play, ex-felons voting, blaming Hillary for Bill.CommentsHenriette Lazaridis PowerAuthor, The Clover HouseThese days, we can consume our art in conditions of perfection: CD\u0027s with no crackle or static, photographs with no scratches.
