But when I saw that the president will be hosting a concert honoring Sir Paul next week, my first reaction wasn\u0027t, \"I hope they play \u0027Hey, Jude.\u0027\" Given the White House\u0027s decidedly tame response to the BP disaster (perfectly summed up by James Carville as \"hands-offy\"), it was, \"Are you kidding me?!\" This is not the time for a White House sing-along. It\u0027s time to set up a temporary White House in New Orleans until the well is capped. And if there is a concert to be held, why not make it a fundraiser for all those whose lives are being destroyed by the oilpocalypse?

Without it, Obama risks turning into a real Nowhere Man.Read Post | CommentsChris Matthews, 05.26.2010Television news anchorOn the eve of the Senate Armed Services Committee\u0027s vote on \"Don\u0027t ask, don\u0027t tell,\" I read a letter from an American serviceman in Afghanistan. \"I found out this soldier under my command was gay,\" he began. \"I learned about it after he died.\"Read Post | CommentsBill Maher, 05.28.2010Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"We just had the fifth anniversary of YouTube and the twelfth of Google, and between them, they\u0027re killing off a great institution: lying.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 05.24.2010Co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington PostThe financial reform bill passed by the Senate last week is more notable for what it has left undone.
