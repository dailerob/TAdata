{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Just over two years ago, at the 25th anniversary of DotCom in Washington D.C., I was asked to predict what the game-changing inventions would be in the next 25 years of the Internet. Mine was less of a prediction than a hope -- that one day someone would create an app that would gauge the state of our mind, body, and spirit, and then offer us the exact steps we would need to take to realign all three aspects of our beings. At the time, I was just thinking out loud. But today, I\u0027m delighted to announce that HuffPost is at work on an app we call \"GPS for the Soul.\" I hope it will be just the beginning of our journey to reconnect with ourselves, our creativity, our intuition, and our wisdom.Read Post | Comments (84)Robert Kuttner, 04/15/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Does Ben Bernanke deserve the accolade bestowed in the April Atlantic magazine cover profile, \"The Hero?\" Not entirely.

Let\u0027s just accelerate the timetable, and let everyone know what really went down at those meetings during the crisis of 2007 and 2008. And we got them. And we\u0027ll show you just what we got.Read Post | Comments (156)Marlo Thomas, 04/16/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistDon\u0027t ever tell me I\u0027m not \"allowed\" to do something. You can attempt to persuade me with logic. But forbid me from doing something? That\u0027s an invitation. And that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be thinking about today, on April 16th, the 40th anniversary of women running in the Boston Marathon.Read Post | Comments (43)Tony Blair, 04/15/12Former Prime Minister of BritainThis is absolutely the right moment for government to do all it can to promote philanthropy; and certainly nothing to harm it.Read Post | Comments (193)Russell Bishop, 04/16/12Author, Consultant and Executive CoachJust as a GPS system in a car helps recalculate your route, GPS for the Soul will help you notice when you\u0027ve gone off-course.

The idea that $30 billion of additional revenue would tip the balance in any way is simply ludicrous.
