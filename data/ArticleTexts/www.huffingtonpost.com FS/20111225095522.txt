{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Merry Christmas, HuffPosters! We have a special gift for you tucked under our Featured Blog Posts tree: a line-up of holiday-inspired offerings. As for me, I\u0027m spending this grace-filled day with my daughters, my sister, and my ex-husband (see our Divorce section for advice on co-parenting during the holidays!). And I am spending much more time today on our Impact section, celebrating those committed to making things better, than on our Politics section, fuming over those whose endless partisan bickering is making things worse. Among the blessings I\u0027m most grateful for today is our HuffPost community -- our team, our bloggers, our commenters, and all of our readers -- which has been an incredible gift. Not a return or re-gift in the bunch!Read Post | Comments (40)Marlo Thomas, 12/23/11Award-winning actress; Author; ActivistHere\u0027s what my merry Christmas contingent had to say about their favorite memories.
