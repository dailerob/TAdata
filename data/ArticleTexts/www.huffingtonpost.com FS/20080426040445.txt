{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOIn his column today, Howard Kurtz takes me on over my post on the self-loathing liberal media -- and completely misses the point. \"Is Arianna saying the media shouldn\u0027t employ conservatives at all?\" he asks. Of course that\u0027s not what I\u0027m saying, Howie. MSM outlets should absolutely include conservative voices in the mix. Just not those whose careers have been built on intentionally deceiving the American people. READ MOREThe Self-Loathing Liberal Media Newsweek hires Karl Rove. The New York Times hires Bill Kristol. CNN hires Tony Snow. By embracing these unabashed propagandists, the mainstream media have revealed a self-loathing streak a mile wide.

And at 11 pm I\u0027ll be on Real Time with Bill Maher on HBO.Read Post | CommentsBIOJohn Ridley, 04.25.2008I take exception with the idea that Wright\u0027s pro-black teachings make him some kind of radical separatist. There\u0027s a difference between being pro-black and pro-white and the difference is a bad one.Read Post | Comments (338)BIOKevin Powell, 04.25.2008Mrs. Bell always told me that she truly believed justice would be done in this case. She really did. I never had the heart to tell her that it is rare for a police officer to be found guilty of murdering a civilian.Read Post | Comments (16)BIOAdam McKay, 04.25.2008Okay, I get it. We let all Republicans and most Democrats off the hook because they will roll over for the companies that own the media and in McCain\u0027s case literally get blown by lobbyists, but come on! Are we not even remotely pretending anymore?Read Post | Comments (46)BIOBill Maher, 04.25.2008New Rule: Stimulating the economy is like stimulating your body--there are good ways and bad ways to do it. And John McCain\u0027s \"gas tax holiday\" is basically economic crystal meth.Read Post | CommentsBIOJackson Williams, 04.25.2008Clinton\u0027s argument may be self-serving, but it\u0027s also true: the Democratic standard-bearer can\u0027t afford to have tens of millions of working class voters, women, and those over age 45 unenergized in November.Read Post | Comments (141)BIOChez Pazienza, 04.25.2008I grew up in Miami in the 80\u0027s, which means that I lived through three major race riots before I was 20-years-old.

But did you really think for one minute they would let it be otherwise?Read Post | Comments (29)BIODylan Loewe, 04.25.2008Obama is being described as unelectable, as incapable of connecting with working class voters, and as someone who might be uncomfortable with patriotism. Obama is being defined by others. It\u0027s time for him to do the defining.Read Post | Comments (260)BIOEric Schmeltzer, 04.25.2008It\u0027s not very often that I\u0027ll compliment McCain, but his campaign\u0027s strategy over this now-infamous North Carolina GOP ad hitting Obama is one shrewd move.Read Post | Comments (12)BIODaniel Levy, 04.25.2008Yesterday could not have presented a more stunning portrayal of the self-marginalization of America as an actor in Israeli-Arab conflict resolution under the Bush administration.Read Post | CommentsAndy Stern, 04.25.2008Raymond J.
