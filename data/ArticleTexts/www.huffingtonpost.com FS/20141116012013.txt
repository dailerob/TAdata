{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWhatever happened on that unfortunate day between Michael Brown and Darren Wilson, nobody should have died. And the tensions resulting from Brown\u0027s death were only exacerbated by the police response that focused on exerting power and control through militarized means rather than ensuring public safety and protecting the rights of everyone in the community. Sadly we cannot rewrite that chapter in Ferguson\u0027s history, but the pages of the next one remain blank. As governor, you have an outsized influence in determining what it will say. You must do everything in your power to ensure no other lives are lost and no other persons are hurt. Your actions can help bring a modicum of justice to a community that has already unjustly suffered so much.Until the final book of my Anjou Trilogy to be published next year, I have not dared tackle the life of a man. I find few men write well about women, and few women write convincingly about men.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.Next week, Arab American leaders from a dozen key electoral states will convene in Washington to map out a political strategy for 2016. Despite the very real challenges facing these leaders, this generation of Arab Americans can approach the future with some confidence given the progress that has been made the last three decades.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027I am thrilled that the comments I made in my cover interview for OUT 100 have generated a spirited dialogue about HIV/AIDS -- and the advent of a whole new class of preventative life saving medication. I am less thrilled that they were almost entirely misconstrued. Perhaps I could have been more articulate -- but my comments were never meant to be incendiary or judgmental.ActorOffice gossip is alive, flowing freely and -- depending on your point of view -- either as natural as casual conversation or a pathogen infecting morale, productivity and even health. Adding to the darker view, gossip may be a special problem for women -- its most able practitioners and, perhaps, its most vulnerable targets.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe proposed Act is a huge step forward in our nation\u0027s effort to redesign our surveillance programs to protect the privacy of American citizens without sacrificing the compelling need to protect our national security. This legislation should be signed by the President -- without delay.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWhen we realize that something as primal as the food that we choose to eat each day makes such an important difference in addressing both global warming and personal health, it empowers us and imbues these choices with meaning.Medical editor, The Huffington Post; Founder and president, Preventive Medicine Research InstituteAmericans need to hold all 2016 candidates to account, congressional and presidential. We can play a role in shaping the platform and agenda, rather than reluctantly accepting a system of mass surveillance.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveBy demonstrating their willingness to work together, the leaders of the United States and China are opening a new chapter in global climate negotiations. This bold leadership comes at a critical time for our planet when the costs of carbon pollution affect our lives more and more each day.Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectBefore we spend billions on various short-term fixes to the Pentagon\u0027s existing nuclear enterprise, let\u0027s rethink the hundreds of billions the department wants to spend on nuclear weapons we don\u0027t need at prices we can\u0027t afford.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyThe millions of Americans who struggle with falling wages, shrinking personal wealth, and rising healthcare costs would presumably be astonished to hear Bill Clinton\u0027s sunny assessment of their future.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThere seems to be one common thread running through the behavior of chronically late individuals that is probably the most shared reason for them being perpetually tardy, and yet it is consistently overlooked. You are late because you don\u0027t want to be early.Writer on health, well being, and psychologyThe 21st-century customer knows more than ever about which farmers are good to the environment and good for the health of shoppers. But there\u0027s one thing that promo ads won\u0027t tell you: whether farmers are good to their employees.Actress, Founder of the Eva Longoria FoundationCo-founder of the Coalition of Immokalee WorkersWe slowly developed an ability to vocalize, to be open and to share the pain. As much as family and friends were there for us, the only person who would understand the day-to-day void left at home was my daughter.A family-first, Brooklyn-based, design-obsessed entrepreneur.In the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina, a few more elderly native speakers of Cherokee silently pass away every few months. A language spoken for at least three millennia in the region faces extinction.William C. Friday Distinguished University Professor at North Carolina State UniversityOur government persists with a business-as-usual path, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus that continued carbon emissions threaten the climate system on which civilization and nature as we know it depend.ClimatologistEnvironmental attorneyWhile all of us are at risk of becoming a victim of identity theft this holiday shopping season, there\u0027s an even bigger problem. It not only pre-dates the digital era, it was around long before credit cards: It\u0027s spending more than you can afford.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911With a stroke of the pen, the president can have a dramatic effect on the lives of millions of workers, leveraging not only the $1 trillion in spending on federal contracts, but setting an example that will accelerate similar action at the state and local level.President, Institute for America\u0027s FuturePundits and policy gurus have long been sounding the alarm, warning that the interests of young and old are on an inevitable collision course -- kids vs. canes. But, the halls of Cleveland\u0027s Intergenerational School tell a very different story -- one of positive outcomes for all involved.Author, \u0027Working Together: Why Great Partnerships Succeed\u0027Author, \u0027The Big Shift: Navigating the New Stage Beyond Midlife\u0027; Founder and CEO, Encore.orgEven with all the shouting between sides, we\u0027re still not discussing the real issue: The US has no comprehensive energy policy, and we stumble, under the terrible lack of leadership in Washington, from crisis to crisis with little effort to reduce our overall demand for heavy hydrocarbons such as crude and coal.Energy Veteran and Author, Founder, this-small-planet.comThe administration is desperate to find a balance: air strikes but no (or few) boots on the ground, attacks on ISIS but no inadvertent bolstering of the Assad regime, assembling a coalition of Arab states against ISIS but trying to prevent some of these states from funding extremist factions on the ground, and so on.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusUnless Earth is special beyond reason, you can confidently assume there are plenty of societies out there. That doesn\u0027t mean that they\u0027ll come to Earth (or, as many believe, already have). Interstellar travel, despite what you\u0027ve seen at the local multiplex, is hard. But we could easily get in touch via radio signals or flashing laser lights.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe execution of Mr. Panetti accomplishes no reasonable goal. Executing someone who does not understand the reason for his punishment violates not only the Constitution, but basic decency.Senior staff attorney, ACLU Capital Punishment ProjectThe annual \"base\" budget of the Pentagon is half a trillion dollars. That\u0027s the money that the Pentagon gets if it fights no wars.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyGone are the days of President Reagan\u0027s ketchup as a vegetable. And it is about time the feds try to do something to combat childhood obesity and promote healthy eating habits. Problem is, a lot of students aren\u0027t eating any of it.Veteran high school teacher and basketball coach; author, \u0027Students First and Other Lies\u0027Is Florida the most dangerous places in the country for children with disabilities, behavioral disorders or the sheer misfortune to be born into abusive families? That could well be the case, based on a series of troubling investigative reports.Contributing Editor, The Washington MonthlyHuge fashion brands, time and time again, fail to include diverse body types in order to challenge unattainable beauty norms and become more reflective of society. Myla Dalbesio serves as a reminder that successful models don\u0027t need to be stick thin.ReadUp, DebateOutBefore arriving in Ferguson, I had never retold Michael Stewart\u0027s story, or my own. I\u0027d hoped to spare the next generation. Still, Stewart\u0027s killing has never left me. It indelibly marked my soul and informs how I move through everyday life: wary, guarded, even afraid, and believing that our bodies are the front lines in a contest over race, rights, and who counts for what.Arthur F. Thurnau Professor; Associate Professor of History and Afroamerican and African Studies, University of MichiganRather than propping up an anything-goes gun culture, religion may be part of the solution in promoting conversations that move beyond the partisan divides that have immobilized debates over gun control.Writer, Association of Religion Data ArchivesThe world is filled with a**holes. They are everywhere. They hit your parked car without leaving a note, cut you off while waiting in line at Whole Foods and literally knock you out of the way on their mad dash to the subway so you face the closed doors instead of them.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityHere\u0027s the craziest part: While Congress mires itself in the politics surrounding Keystone, it continues to ignore critical tax policies that could lead to exponentially more American-made jobs in renewables and energy efficiency.Executive Director, Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2)Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"VERSION 2.0 GO FOR LAUNCH",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
