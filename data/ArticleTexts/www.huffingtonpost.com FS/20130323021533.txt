{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIf the current crisis were to intensify to such an extent as to force Cyprus to leave the eurozone, look for it to turn to Russia for immediate financial assistance to stabilize what would likely be a very disorderly domestic situation. And if this once-improbable (indeed, once-unthinkable) event were to materialize, expect Russia to be highly willing and very able to step into the chaos. Europe has more than an immediate economic and financial interest in working with Cyprus to stabilize an increasingly volatile situation. And it should do so driven less by the need avoid an institutional Eurozone exit and more by the importance of fundamentally restoring growth and hope to Cyprus.Comments (104)Joshua FoerWinner of the USA Memory Championship; Co-founder, Atlas ObscuraHere\u0027s the thing: Despite being U.S. memory champions, Kolli, Dellis, and I occasionally misplace our car keys, just like everyone else. We don\u0027t actually have great memories.Comments (88)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowWe have an untapped resource that has yet to be re-purposed. Our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are not only experiencing a criminal rate of unemployment, but they are the men and women who have proven themselves willing to pull together and face the most difficult challenges, under the most dire circumstances.Comments (15)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAnyone who knows me will tell you that I love when things are organized. When I first moved in with my husband and his teenage boys, I actually color-coded their towels. It worked! And my desk is an organizational work of art -- pens over there, paperwork over here and a typed to-do list just to be sure I get it all done.Comments (28)Flynt and Hillary Mann LeverettGoing To Tehran authors; Penn State Professor and American University Senior LecturerThe United States is reaching the end of its ability to threaten ever more severe sanctions against third countries doing business with Iran -- but rarely implement such \"secondary\" sanctions -- without eroding the deterrent effect of the threat.Comments (130)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistRumor has it the U.S. Senate will consider a budget bill provision to approve the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. Here\u0027s what they need to share with their constituents.Comments (284)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe psychological and emotional toll of gun violence on bystanders, victims, and families can be overwhelming and leaves effects that last for years. What about the costs we can count? In addition to the trauma that is so deep and pervasive that it is harder to quantify, there are actual costs to gun violence that can be measured and are enormous.CommentsJillian BermanAssociate Business Editor, The Huffington PostDon\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m happy everyone is more aware of the plight of working women, but all the advice isn\u0027t helping me overcome the real obstacles to my success in the workplace and frankly, in life.Comments (143)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorDidn\u0027t someone around the table in Brussels raise their hand and say, \"Hey, wait a sec... do we really want to levy this tax on a banking system that\u0027s already teetering?\"CommentsTom Zeller Jr.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostIs Earth Hour, the annual ritual in which people the world over turn out their lights as a show of solidarity in the fight against climate change and other environmental issues, a waste of time and energy? Bjorn Lomborg certainly thinks so.Comments (111)Penny Love HoffFitness/Lifestyle CoachLosing your memory is sort of like gaining weight; you don\u0027t quite know how it happened but one day your zipper won\u0027t quite zip. And the same thing happens mentally.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIronically, it\u0027s many of the same politicians who say they are \"tough on crime\" that are collecting millions of dollars in campaign money from the biggest crooks in America.Comments (52)Hope KronmanStudentWe will continue to find new and, I\u0027m sure, exhilarating ways to connect online. And while we do, we must not lose sight of the boundaries between real and virtual life.CommentsBill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolIn my experience, mindful people make much better leaders than frenetic, aggressive ones. They understand their reactions to stress and crises, and understand their impact on others. They are far better at inspiring people to take on greater responsibilities and at aligning them around common missions and values.Comments (13)Laura SchockerSenior Editor, Healthy LivingDespite being a stage-five worrier, I try to keep my anxiety in its proper perspective. But after researching and writing a piece published earlier this week about what stress is doing to your body, I realized I still have a long way to go when it comes to handling the ever-present stress in my life.Comments (29)Christine LagardeManaging Director, IMFThe goal of continued stability -- and certainly the hope for more broadly shared growth -- cannot be taken lightly. Everybody I spoke to in Algiers agreed the country needs a more open and diverse economy to create a bigger pie, and to ensure that all Algerians get their fair share in it.CommentsRep. Keith Ellison and Rep. Raúl M. GrijalvaAll we\u0027ve heard from Republicans is the same exhausted line about cutting everything in sight, retrenching, reining in the American dream, and foreclosing on any positive government role in our nation\u0027s future. It\u0027s time for jobs to be the priority for Washington that it already is for the American people.Comments (83)Kerri ZaneSingle mom advisor and healthy living expertYes, it can be very stressful, but there are actually a lot of benefits too.Comments (395)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsToday, General Lloyd Austin became the first African-American to lead the U.S. Central Command, which has a wide-ranging area of responsibility for 20 countries in the Middle East and southwest Asia. His appointment is effective immediately.Comments (12)Gayatri Devi, M.D.Neurologist and Director of the New York Memory ServicesWhy should we when we can outsource it to our cell phones? Our brains, honed to remember key people in our lives, cannot possibly remember the myriad numbers of celebrities and acquaintances we meet, which is why we call in Google.CommentsSimon JohnsonAuthor, \u0027White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You\u0027In plain English, what Sir John Peace said is called lying. Or, if you prefer the language of securities lawyers, he engaged in deliberate misrepresentation. He also violated Standard Chartered\u0027s deferred prosecution agreement with US authorities.Comments (27)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesAmericans are getting more value for their health care dollars due to the health care law. Affordable Care Act initiatives are promoting coordinated care; paying for quality, not quantity; and dramatically reducing fraud and waste, contributing to the slowest growth in national health spending in 50 years.Comments (53)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveWhile liberals deplore the process that produced the ultra-conservative House of Representatives, the reality is that America is culturally gerrymandered. There are toxic pockets, like Provo, Utah, where citizens believe \"Government is the enemy.\"Comments (510)John Whyte, M.D., MPHChief Medical Expert and VP, Health and Medical Education at Discovery ChannelWhile the spring season does offer the chance to pick up on those healthy New Year\u0027s resolutions that you might have conveniently forgotten, it is not without its share of misconceptions. Let\u0027s take a look at five common spring health myths and why they are more fiction than fact.CommentsErica AbeelAuthor, \u0027Conscience Point\u0027Few lawmakers have the guts to ask: What powers does our government have to kill people without due process? The larger question asked by Dirty Wars: What happens to us as Americans when we finally see what\u0027s hidden in plain sight?CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowHere we are, ten years later, Democrats -- commemorating an unnecessary war in Iraq by continuing to allow gun zealots to purchase unnecessary weapons of war. Obviously, Democrats are more willing to vote for a misguided war than to prevent the proliferation of weapons of war.Comments (1,119)Alexandra RosarioAssociate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostI had only been engaged for four months when I realized something important about my wedding.Comments (58)Linda BergtholdHealth policy researcherWhat is actually going on with health reform? Is it really going to happen? Yes it is. But it will mean different things for different people. Here\u0027s what it might mean for some of you.Comments (198)Dr. R. Keith SawyerAssociate Professor, Washington University; Author, \u0027Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration\u0027You probably think that memory is the exact opposite of creativity. After all, the things you memorize already exist, they\u0027re not new. And creativity is all about a new idea that didn\u0027t exist before... right?CommentsShelley EmlingEditor, Post 50We\u0027re all guilty of muttering something off-putting now and then, but there are simply a few words and phrases that -- according to some -- are just plain strange to hear coming out of the mouths of post 50s.Comments (157)Bonnie FullerPresident \u0026 Editor-in-Chief, HollywoodLife.comRush Limbaugh took to the radio airwaves on Wednesday, Mar. 20 to slam Beyoncé and her new highly confident anthem. But Rush clearly didn\u0027t even listen to the song.Comments (39)Jodi Okun, 2013.22.03Marian Wright Edelman, 2013.22.03Chris Weigant, 2013.22.03Ken Fallin, 2013.22.03Mark Brennan Rosenberg, 2013.22.03Shawn Amos, 2013.22.03Stereo IQ, 2013.22.03Maya Rupert, 2013.22.03Julie Gray, 2013.22.03Jonathan Smith, 2013.22.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"MOURNING IN AMERICA: THOUSANDS KILLED SINCE NEWTOWN1 DAY SINCE NEWTOWN37 DEAD  ",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
