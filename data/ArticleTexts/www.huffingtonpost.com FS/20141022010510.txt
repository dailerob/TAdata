{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Doing something stupid is not always better than doing nothing. And imposing a travel ban is high on the list of stupid things. The travel banners may have enormous faith in the competence of government, but as a practical matter a travel ban will not keep everyone who has been Liberia out of the country. People will come through third countries and simply lie about their travel history. Passport marks will be smudged or removed. Travel banners may have great confidence in the ability of our immigration authorities to prevent such trickery, but those of us in the real world know that many people will slip by. And, thanks to the travel banners, these people who may have been exposed to Ebola will be hiding from the health authorities because they have broken the law to get into the country. Now isn\u0027t that a great way to control the virus?I have worn Oscar de la Renta\u0027s signature fragrance, Oscar, my whole adult life, and I will stay forever devoted and will wear him to my grave. Gentle, soft, feminine, chic, elegant. His style. My scent. Words I attribute to us both.Actress and children\u0027s book authorIt\u0027s hard to tell how much the far right, in its enduring hate for Obama, is seeing an opportunity in the Ebola hysteria, or the Ebola anxiety is feeding and re-igniting those racist and religious attacks on Obama from their heyday in \u002707-\u002710 when he was so unknown.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesThe times that are most challenging for us as parents -- the times when we must discipline our kids -- are the times we have the greatest ability to support and shape a child\u0027s growing brain.New York Times Bestselling Author, Neuropsychiatrist, Mindsight Educator, and Interpersonal NeurobiologistCo-author of \u0027The Whole-Brain Child\u0027Do you supervise individuals that would describe themselves as an introvert? In many cases, we hold misconceptions about introversion, which can lead to ill-fated supervisory decisions. I\u0027d like to point you in the right direction.Industrial/Organizational Psychologist, consultant and speakerThe conversation about privilege threatens to cut off the legs of the feminist movement before it can even crawl (yes -- crawl, we\u0027re in 2014 and birth control is seen by many as a dirty word). Privilege is weighing us down. By us I mean all of us -- all feminists.Host and producer, HuffPost LiveWriter, Communications ConsultantIt is now possible for insurgent, anti-establishment candidates to raise a ton of money from small donors online, and to use that money, plus the Internet, plus old-fashioned organizing, to build nationwide, strong volunteer organizations -- all without any help from either of the idiot parties.Electoral College DropoutMedical Correspondent, CBS Evening News with Scott PelleyPerhaps the spread is a commentary on party culture. Perhaps it\u0027s a cautionary tale. Or maybe it\u0027s just a series of provocative photos meant to do exactly as they have done -- and many works of art have done before them -- which is spark conversation.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhen the risks are very high and the treatment benefits low, a duty to treat is less than categorical.Professor of Preventive Medicine, Stony Brook University School of MedicineImmigration enforcement officials, or ICE, took my husband, after having overstayed his visa by 20 days. He was caught going ten miles over the speed limit, and now awaits deportation after a month-long incarceration.International development workerThe World Series between the Kansas City Royals and the San Francisco Giants features two teams that were pretty good in the regular season but have been played either excellent (the Giants) or almost flawless (the Royals) baseball during the postseason. There is a clear path to winning for both teams.lincolnmitchell.comTo the deep consternation of the oilogopoly and their kindred and influential allies in government and finance the price of oil has been dropping precipitously.Author, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027Your gender, religion, race or sexual orientation has no effect on your ability to lead conversations.NBA PlayerAs the onslaught of the nation\u0027s fast-growing coal-mining boom tears across the heartland, citizens in southern Illinois have filed a Writ of Mandamus in Federal District Court against the US Secretary of Interior, in an attempt to revoke the state\u0027s control over its notoriously inept and rogue mining agencies.Author of \"Reckoning at Eagle Creek: Secret Legacy of Coal in the Heartland,\" www.jeffbiggers.comWay back in 2008, my now husband and I went on our first date. On our one year anniversary, his gift to me was a Word doc of all of our text messages since our first date (what he likes to refer to as #thegiftofdata). To celebrate our six year anniversary, I decided to take his present to the next level.Data scientist. Blogger. Lover of all things girly.The US can become carbon neutral in our lifetimes. In the process, we will put millions of Americans to work, make our companies more competitive, and shield our communities from extreme weather. And we will honor our obligation to leave the world a better place for future generations.President, NRDCThink of Ebola as the universe\u0027s unfair challenge to everything that war bred in our governmental system. As it happens, those things that the U.S. did, often ineffectively and counterproductively, to thwart its enemies, potential enemies, and even its own citizenry will not be an antidote to this \"enemy\" either.Director, Center on National Security at Fordham Law SchoolI\u0027ve never been in a situation where I thought I could be raped. I\u0027m a big guy, strong, how could I be raped? Until the moment when my legs were in the air, totally vulnerable, looking into the eyes of a man insistent on fucking me, did I ponder, Am I in danger?Writer, Comedian, ManRed Army is a documentary about so much more than just hockey. It\u0027s a window not just into the world of elite athletes, but also into the Cold War -- its oppression, its defections, its KGB trickery, its era of indefatigable distrust and ever-simmering antipathy between them and us.Former CIA Operative; Author; Security and Intelligence Consultant; Contributor on TechKnow; MomAt this moment there is no Ebola epidemic in the United States. But some have tried -- quite intentionally -- to create an epidemic of fear and panic for their own political gain. That is irresponsible and reprehensible.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe real reason that the gunnies want to push physicians out of the discussion about gun violence is because the NRA and its allies want to disconnect gun ownership from violence to make their products more acceptable, more enjoyable, more normal for every dad and mom.Mike the Gun GuyStudies show as many as 48 percent of people in abusive situations stay out of concern for their pets\u0027 safety, and more than 70 percent of pet owners entering shelters report their batterer had threatened, injured or killed their pets. But despite this issue, most domestic violence shelters only take humans -- no pets are allowed.Freelance journalist; Founder, Rock 1 KidneyRich people often try to self-fund (buy) their way into office, but how successful are they?Board Certified in Internal MedicineI\u0027ve been to West Africa, working as a music journalist, and to get there from the United States is not easy. I was based in Ann Arbor at the time, and had to take four flights to get to Mali, connecting in places like Amsterdam and Zurich along the way.Music journalist (Afropop Worldwide, the Rough Guides) and CD producer (The Rough Guide to World Music CD series).There is a phenomenon of what I call, \"First-World-Problem-Shaming,\" where we make people feel bad about their anxieties because somewhere in the world children are starving.WriterIt\u0027s become somewhat of a Sunday morning tradition: I lie in bed, I scroll through Instagram, I see pictures from the various weddings my friends have attended that weekend, I click on the wedding hashtag, I silently look at 15, 20, sometimes 50 pictures of what is often a complete stranger\u0027s wedding. Repeat.Author of \"Modern Dating: A Field Guide\"Statistically, black women are more likely to die of breast cancer than white women, even though more white women are diagnosed with it. Heartbreakingly, one of the reasons for this is fear.Founder and Spokesperson, PinkChoseMe FoundationI\u0027ve seen the vaccination debate from many angles, and I think I can help clear some things up.

Here are the most common concerns I hear, and some responses.Author of Keep Calm and Parent OnAs a gay man who has been with my partner for almost 13 years and married for almost two, it felt nice to hear these two Christian groups making an effort toward gay people.
