{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Two new American generals have been summoned to oversee military training efforts in Iraq. Each will, in due course, be called upon to testify before Congress as to the progress they are making in their mission. Neither will earn an additional star if he reports back that his charges are militarily incapable of achieving the optimistic objectives set forth by the Obama administration. Congress can anticipate that each of these men, and any others they call upon to testify, will provide them with the sort of pat answers one has come to expect from such hearings. But void of meaningful political change in both Iraq and within the political leadership of the \"Free Syrian Army,\" there will be no cause in either of those countries worthy of the sacrifice of the men America plans to train to fight in the spring offensive of 2015.Conflicts in faraway places matter in various ways to the United States. These conflicts matter because we recognize that violence within any particular country can quickly cause national and regional instability, displacing millions of people, upending markets.U.S. Ambassador to the United NationsThere are essentially three primary reasons why Republicans enjoyed such an impressive victory on election night.Television political commentator, radio talk show host, lecturer, political analystHeroes usually make a decision to put themselves in danger or to protect people who are in danger. But the true victims in this story -- the mountain gorillas of Virunga -- are hard to see as anything other than innocent quarry of machinations far beyond their ken.Award-Winning filmmakerTomorrow, I will miss the bonding experience that is nursing my baby. Instead, she will struggle to eat (she doesn\u0027t do well with the bottle) as I rush throughout my day to pump for her in a small, confined space. The thought of this alone makes my heart hurt and my frustrations rise.Mother and writerLet\u0027s face it, the status quo is sustained -- and the media should know better, that the more things \"change,\" the more they stay the same.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveThe campaigns and the media coverage were all about polls, attacks, and sound bites. The Republican campaign message was simply: vote against President Obama. Here\u0027s what we should be talking about.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe inadequacy of words that console is exacerbated when a child takes his or her own life. It\u0027s a loss that adds the additional burdens of unbearable remorse and unanswered questions to already grieving parents; the general ambiguity heightens the pain and prolongs the grieving process.Partner, Sensei Marketing; Author, Influence MarketingOn Election night, 2014, as campaign spending records were shattered and Jon Stewart declared \"Money\" the big winner, the people of Tallahassee, Florida lit a beacon of hope for the rest of the nation.Director, Represent.UsAn adopted person can -- sometimes -- be fortunate enough to find the identity of their biological mother and father through one of the major commercial DNA tests available today. And they can potentially learn quite a lot from it.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityGenomics technical manager for AncestryDNAPity the American people for imagining that they have just elected the new Congress. In a formal way, they of course have. The public did vote. But in a substantive way, it\u0027s not true that they have chosen their government. This was the billionaires\u0027 election, billionaires of both parties.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityYour Social Security number is a skeleton key in the hands of an identity thief, but it\u0027s not just about money. Those nine digits are used in too many transactions to enumerate, and because of that, there are plenty of opportunities for them to fall into the wrong hands.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The Kris Maharaj case is a judicial train wreck, and it is sadly not unique: it is past time for a wholesale reassessment of how we deal with a miscarriage of justice, and time is running out for Mr. Maharaj.Actress, activist and motherAs Bob Herbert tells us, we have lost our way. Our elected officials dream no big dreams. They have little or no concept of major public works programs to rebuild our nation\u0027s infrastructure, which would put millions of people to work and invigorate our economy.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027To some it appears that there are two separate electorates in the U.S. -- one for the general election that closely resembles the makeup of the actual population, and one for the mid-terms that skews heavily toward older, more Republican voters. That perception is generally true, but it\u0027s not entirely that simple.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersWe like to think that somewhere, in each state, there\u0027s a truly sublime pie, and to prove that point, we\u0027ve crunched the numbers (and the crusts) and come up with a definitive list of the best pizzerias in every corner of this great nation.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelWe have seen the rise of a community known as the disgruntled commenter, the one who picks fights, hates the writing, never has anything nice (or productive) to say. But that\u0027s the price we pay and, well, I\u0027ve come to realize it\u0027s a relatively small one.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarFashion PhotographerSo many children need help escaping the poverty and violence and homelessness and unequal schools that are setting them up to fail.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIf Republicans emphatically do not want to cooperate in any meaningful way with Democrats, is there anything Obama can do to change that? No, not really. But according to the press, Obama is supposed to change that equation, or else he loses.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaAlthough Republicans will now control 53 percent of the seats in the Senate, these Republican senators actually represent only 46 percent of the American people. It\u0027s a strange kind of landslide, indeed.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWhen I resided in a different body, I didn\u0027t know how different my life would be and how different I would feel about myself in a fat body.Marketing, Medical Device \u0026 Healthcare Industry, WriterHe\u0027s now written a memoir titled Herbie Hancock: Possibilities that deals frankly with his life, including wrestling with drugs and how his family and his faith in Buddhism helped him overcome his addiction.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorYour data is telling a story about you. Maybe the story\u0027s a good one: you vote at every election, you pay your bills on time, you do your job well and get to work on time each day. But there are now so many data brokers -- buyers and sellers of data -- that databases may be defaming you without you even knowing it.Author, The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms that Control Money \u0026 Information (Harvard University Press, 2015)My three children are Oglala Lakota. They grew up here on the Pine Ridge Reservation. If they hadn\u0027t, maybe they wouldn\u0027t have known about the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. That\u0027s because Wounded Knee, the most famous catastrophe in Native history, is rarely taught in U.S. schools.President and Co-founder of Native American Natural Foods, tankabar.comCritics revile Rand for defending selfishness as a virtue -- but a less altruistic, more self-centric, more rational approach to dating is precisely what women need to date with less drama, less resentment, less heartache.Malibu based writer, former Cato Institute policy director and former speechwriter for President H.W. BushDemocratic strategists have been segmenting the electorate and seeking individual self-interest-based issues in each electoral block. The strategists also keep suggesting a move to the right. This has left no room for the Democrats to have an overriding authentic moral identity that Americans can recognize.Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics and Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!This film was to be titled Top Secret. The Hollywood trades compared the race to make the first atomic film to the U.S. vs. Germany race to make The Bomb. At the Truman Library, I discovered a 16-page outline by Rand from January 19, 1946.Author, Blogger, Film ProducerA quiet moment and a sound different from anything I\u0027d heard at the table happened. Finley, her head resting on the table, arms crossed beneath her face like a cradle. Her voice no more than a squeak, I missed it the first time.Advertising professional and blogger, amandamagee.comOf all the countries that I\u0027ve visited in this region, the mentality of people here in Romania seems to have changed less than in the other places.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusAusterity and supply-side economics don\u0027t work to create jobs and they don\u0027t work with voters. As 2016 looms, Hillary and the insightful Republicans will figure out how to deal with all that, in different ways, but deal with it they will. No one will want to embrace the economic policies and politics of Andrew Cuomo.Senior Fellow, DemosGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"SEALS: \u0027SHOOTER\u0027 A SHAM",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
