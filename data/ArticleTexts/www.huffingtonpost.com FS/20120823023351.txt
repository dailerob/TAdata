{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Given the way Mitt Romney gushed when he introduced Paul Ryan as his VP pick, you\u0027d think he\u0027d not just found his running mate, but his soul mate as well. Romney praised Ryan for his \"leadership,\" his \"values,\" his \"steadiness,\" and his \"firm principles.\" But then, right after Ryan was picked, the Romney campaign immediately made sure that Ryan abandoned each one of those qualities. In other words, you fall in love with that special someone for his independence and fiery spirit -- and then right after the honeymoon, you try to turn him into a doormat. It\u0027s a strange process for both members of the ticket. We\u0027ve set up a system to pick our leaders in which the willingness to lose all self-respect -- to say nothing of our respect -- is one of the essential job requirements.Read Post | CommentsTavis Smiley, 08/22/12PBS talk show host, PRI radio hostIn this election season, how many of us are living a lie by remaining silent and static about things that should matter -- practicing a politics of convenience and cowardice, rather than a politics of courage and conviction?Read Post | Comments (141)Rep.

But it\u0027s to recognize that self-esteem really, truly comes as the result of achievement -- in the classroom, on the field, at home -- rather than false accomplishments.Read Post | Comments (85)Dr. Michael J. Breus, 08/22/12Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistWe know that sleep has a great effect on how we eat. But does how we eat -- or more precisely, what we eat -- have an effect on our sleep? One thing we might not be talking about enough is how choosing the right foods can help strengthen sleep.Read Post | Comments (16)Lisa Turner, 08/22/12Enlightened nutrition, intuitive eating, healthy livingThere\u0027s not much you can do to stop the inexorable march of time; but you can protect your health, and age more gracefully, with the following foods:Read Post | Comments (43)Noah Michelson, 08/22/12Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesRight-wing and evangelical pundits are ignoring one little thing: If we consider that, at the very least, straight Americans outnumber queer Americans 10 to 1, then there are many, many more straight people in this country having \"gay sex\" than there are gay people having it.Read Post | Comments (265)Marcus Samuelsson, 08/22/12Chef and authorOur country is in the midst of a cataclysmic health crisis, much of it caused by how we eat. There shouldn\u0027t be a distinction between what\u0027s healthy and unhealthy. Cooking and eating well is not just an issue of access or cost -- it\u0027s also an issue of education and understanding.Read Post | Comments (13)George Lakoff and Glenn W.
