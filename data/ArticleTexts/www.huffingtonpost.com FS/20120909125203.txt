{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Afghanistan. Mitt Romney didn\u0027t even mention it in Tampa. Clint Eastwood did, and got a big applause by asking Invisible Obama why he won\u0027t bring the troops home in short order. It\u0027s not a bad question -- especially given the president\u0027s promise in Charlotte to \"use the money we\u0027re no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work...it\u0027s time to do some nation-building right here at home.\" But despite sky-high unemployment right here at home and a war price tag of $2 billion a week, the president stuck with his plan to withdraw from Afghanistan by 2014. He opened his acceptance speech by harkening back to his 2004 convention keynote. Perhaps he should have harkened back to 2002, when he declared, \"I\u0027m not opposed to all wars. I\u0027m opposed to dumb wars.\" Afghanistan has become a dumb war. It\u0027s time to get out.Read Post | Comments (52)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 09/07/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCONotwithstanding citizens dropping out of the labor force, 5 million Americans were classified in August as \"long-term unemployed.\" Meanwhile, teenage joblessness rose to over 24% -- an alarming level given the risk that out of work youth face in going from being unemployed to being unemployable. As hard as Ben Bernanke and his Fed colleagues try -- and they have been trying very hard, taking monetary policy ever deeper into unfamiliar/experimental territory -- the institution does not have the proper tools to deal with our unemployment crisis. The bottom line is a simple one. It should concern us all as citizens and parents. And it is worth repeating over and over again: If Congress is not careful, these trends will further increase an already-material risk that, for the first time in a very long time, our children\u0027s generation may be worse off than that of their parents.Read Post | Comments (956)Michael Moore, 09/07/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorDon\u0027t sit it out. Don\u0027t try to convince anyone Obama has magically transformed us - just tell them four years is simply not enough time to undo all the hurt caused by biggest economic crash since the Great Depression and the biggest military blunder/lie in our history.Read Post | Comments (1,313)Patton Oswalt, 09/06/12Comedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesNothing wrong with being rich. Nothing wrong with striving and bettering yourself. But there\u0027s definitely something wrong with people confusing capitalism and corporatism (the latter wants to destroy the former) -- and then demanding everyone else make the same mistake.Read Post | Comments (1,019)Arianna Huffington, 09/03/12The thinking behind the HuffPost Oasis at the national conventions is to help people to better deal with the destructive effects of stress in their lives and to help them be their best selves so they can go out in the world and make a difference in the lives of others.Read Post | Comments (91)Paul Reiser, 09/04/12Actor, writer and stand-up comedianThe term \"gentle giant\" may be overused, but I can\u0027t imagine a soul for whom the words could be better intended.Read Post | Comments (72)Steven Van Zandt, 09/08/12Record producer, songwriter, and musicianWhat the Democrats needed to do this week was very clearly lay out what they had intended to accomplish during the first term and why it didn\u0027t happen.

That\u0027s why I\u0027m running for president and that\u0027s why I approved this message.Read Post | Comments (377)Richard Branson, 09/04/12Founder, Virgin GroupThe war on drugs has had a devastating impact in the U.S. Yet, as Republicans and Democrats gather at their national conventions, neither party has taken a strong stand on the critical need to support drug policy reform. And that\u0027s surprising. Drug reform is not a partisan issue. For Republicans, reform efforts both ensure and secure states\u0027 rights and at the same time minimize waste of limited federal dollars. For Democrats, minorities who make up a large portion of their constituency disproportionately bear the greatest burden of current drug policies. And a Gallup Poll this past year found that fully 50 percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana.Read Post | Comments (2,272)Marlo Thomas, 09/06/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistAs kids head back to classrooms this month -- many of them on school buses -- it\u0027s time for parents and guardians to step in and step up to their responsibility, and help avert another year of bullying before it has a chance to begin.Read Post | Comments (43)Mark Cuban, 09/05/12Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, HDNetI only wish that candidates were held to the same standards of fact that CEO\u0027s of public companies are.

Examination, urine sample, and blood tests were taken and I was rushed to hospital for a scan.Read Post | Comments (46)Jim Wallis, 09/05/12Christian leader for social changeWe\u0027ve got a poverty problem in this country, paired with leaders who won\u0027t even say the word \"poverty,\" let alone solve the problem. We have a political class that is so far removed from the hardships of a normal life that they can\u0027t even connect with the middle class, let alone the poor. In Washington, the pervasive dominance of money in politics has made it nearly impossible for the stories and hardships of the poor to make headway into the national conversations. The poor don\u0027t have lobbyists or super PACs, and they certainly don\u0027t have a real commitment in the party platforms at the conventions this season. So people of faith and conscience will keep beating the drum about poverty and asking each candidate, every candidate, what their policies will do to the least of these.Read Post | Comments (845)Cecile Richards, 09/05/12President, Planned Parenthood Action FundBarack Obama has fought for women over the last four years -- and that\u0027s why we\u0027re fighting for him in this election.Read Post | Comments (155)James Franco, 09/05/12Actor and authorSpalding Gray\u0027s Morning, Noon and Night is charming and disarming.

The economy is dead in the water. Obama has no plan but to wait for the upturn. Mitt Romney\u0027s plan to cut taxes would be disastrously worse, plunging us into a deep financial and social crisis. It\u0027s long past time to face basic facts. America\u0027s economic problems are structural and will not be solved by more tax cuts, quantitative easing, or short-term stimulus. Neither party offers real solutions, though the Republicans\u0027 policies would drive us much faster to ruin. Real solutions require fresh strategies to break free of vested interests in energy, healthcare, education, and infrastructure. In other words, in today\u0027s political environment, real solutions won\u0027t happen any time soon. We are stuck.Read Post | Comments (448)Chris Fici, 2012. 9.09Sister Joan Chittister, OSB, 2012. 9.09Joshua Stanton, 2012. 9.09Craig Crawford, 2012. 9.09Janine Boldrin, 2012. 9.09Neil Parmar, 2012. 9.09David Gebler, 2012. 9.09Cody Tresierra, 2012. 9.09Arianna Huffington, 2012. 9.09Marki Flannery, 2012. 8.09","h1":"ROMNEY ADVISERS: WE\u0027RE LOSINGHuffpost Live",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in StyleYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalAOLConnect with your friendsMost Popular on HuffPostDon\u0027t Miss HuffPost Bloggers","h2":"Using a mobile device?
