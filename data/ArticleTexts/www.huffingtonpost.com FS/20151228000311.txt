{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On Christmas morning, millions of children woke up early to see what was under the Christmas tree (no doubt, merchandise from a certain movie set \"a long time ago\" was well-represented). But millions more woke up to a very different reality filled with fear, instability and misery in parts of the world where conflict, civil war, and massive refugee displacements rage. And that\u0027s to say nothing of the xenophobia, scapegoating and ugliness that have taken hold of our political culture here at home. No matter what tradition we come from, as we enjoy the last moments of the holiday season with our loved ones, let\u0027s remember those around the world for whom Peace on Earth isn\u0027t just a holiday greeting, but a dream that is tragically out of reach.In recent weeks, two of the legal scholars I most admire have independently called for possible limitations on the scope of First Amendment protection in light of the dangers posed to the United States by online radicalization messages directed at Americans. Although I certainly understand the concerns driving these suggestions, it is essential that we resist the temptation to restrict our most fundamental freedoms in moment of panic.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt\u0027s not just that God came, but how God came. It wasn\u0027t accidental that the savior of the world was born to a poor peasant woman in an occupied country in an animal stall because they were literally homeless at the time of his birth. And soon Jesus and his family were made refugees and had to flee their country because the most powerful political ruler around the Christ child felt very threatened by his coming.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThis holy season as Christians honor and celebrate the birth of the world\u0027s most famous poor baby born in a manger, I hope we all will pause to remember the 15.5 million invisible poor babies and children in our rich country who need our help to survive and thrive and reach their God-given potential.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhen it comes to the Federal Reserve Board and its importance to the economy, most of the candidates seem to be failing as badly as Donald Trump did on his nuclear triad test.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027After three decades of engineering a winner-take-all economy, and buying the political power to consummate their hold on the wealth created by the system they had rigged in their favor, America\u0027s plutocrats have been taking the final and irrevocable step of separating themselves permanently from the common course of American life.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe 20D vote has thus opened the door to no less than three extremely complex and uncertain scenarios. The only certainty about this election is that the country broke with its past.Editorial Director, El Huffington PostA number of folks have asked me about an article claiming that recent minimum wage increases may have \"killed as many as 200,000 jobs.\" In fact, based on a balanced look at the underlying data, the article could also just as easily have argued that these increases did not kill 200,000 jobs. Let me explain.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPeople may think that women no longer face sexism in media or politics when they speak, but that ignores the very obvious fact that even before women say anything they have already, in split seconds, jumped through hundreds of \"what if I said something about sexism\" hoops.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Cruz, not Trump, is becoming the man to watch. And he bears watching. His holiday rhetoric is not that of a God-smacked extremist prone to verbal excess, but a cold-eyed cynic, a top-tier graduate of Princeton and Harvard who condescends to his target audience for his own narrow ends.Novelist and contributing opinion writerThe principle that one should \"love they neighbor as thyself\" is the direct opposite of the kind of right wing philosophy embodied by Ayn Rand and her disciple, Paul Ryan -- and by people like Donald Trump or Ted Cruz.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersAs a member of Congress and the head of a social security advocacy group, we believe that it\u0027s time to take action to ensure that seniors, veterans, workers who have been forced to stop work as the result of serious and permanent disabilities, and others receive a badly needed raise.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksU.S. Representative from Illinois\u0027 8th Congressional DistrictThe U.S. has some big problems that require bold solutions. Unfortunately, books about solutions to our society\u0027s problems are often given short shrift by reviewers or languish on our bookshelves. As I often say, this country has more problems than it deserves and more solutions than it uses. Now comes S. David Freeman.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorCelebrate as you will -- Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, something else or nothing at all. But to paraphrase Bernie Sanders, \"enough with your damn war on Christmas.\" Can we just have some peace on earth and lay this phony war to rest in peace?Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIn Jesus\u0027s time, there were no borders, or border patrols. If you were in danger, then you would just tie your belongings to your donkey, and you would leave. And wherever you went, no one would think of turning you away or hurting you, simply because you were from somewhere else.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictWalter, I pray that on this Christmas and every Christmas for as long as you shall live that you will remember and know how much your parents love you. May the birth of Jesus be a reminder that your life is precious.Former Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostNow millions of Black girls AND women will see this story in a whole new way and more importantly, they will see themselves in the smartest, kindest, most useful character in the entire Harry Potter series. Eventually, Black girls will start to see themselves as limitless. What could possibly be wrong with that?Blog Editor, The Huffington PostEven the ideas you consider worthy and apolitical have to struggle to rise above the noise level. I hope that many who read these lines and think about the many Syrian children who will spend this season in schools that are bombed, scavenging for food, will not only sign the petition but also ask others to join us in advancing a good cause.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityMartin Shkreli, the former hedge-fund manager turned pharmaceutical CEO who was arrested last week, has been described as a sociopath and worse. In reality, he\u0027s a brasher and larger version of what others in finance and corporate suites do all the time.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027This December marks seven years since my dear friend and lover passed away. Nothing about that winter felt merry, and I certainly didn\u0027t feel in the \"holiday spirit.\" My heart was breaking while the rest of the world carried on singing carols and exchanging gifts, putting on their best holiday game face.Writer, Traveler, Optimist, and End-of-Life care Advocate.Republicans are trying to whip people into a frenzy, then convince them that only by taking extreme steps can their government keep them \"safe.\" And, of course, only Republicans have the you-know-whats to take those extreme steps because \"political correctness,\" blah, blah, blah.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027I have no idea what\u0027s going to unfold on the campaign trail in 2016. But I do know the press would be better off reporting the facts, rather than being tied to outdated narratives that don\u0027t reflect reality.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaBased on our research, we know that prevention is possible. We\u0027ve made youth sports concussion one of our focus areas, but we can\u0027t solve this issue alone. All of us play a role in creating a culture of concussion safety. Here\u0027s how we can prevent sports-related head injuries.Director, CDC\u0027s National Center for Injury Prevention and ControlWhy can\u0027t we just admit that BB-8 is adorable, Finn is hilarious, Rey is badass, seeing Han and Chewie again was awesome, the special effects were tremendous, Poe is Soloesque, Kylo Ren is intriguing -- and this movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever?Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingDear Hillary: Your post also troubles me. You cannot intersperse a few words in Spanish and a couple references to what your staff assumes to be a Latinx culture, and then call yourself our abuela.Masters Candidate in Religion, Yale UniversityThe message of winning humbly is lost on many of us. Even more, the idea of resilience in the face of numerous defeat. If anyone understands how to transcend the agony of losing, it is you, the breadwinner of your family since you were 11 years old.Poet/novelist, community organizer and educatorSometimes the biggest obstacles are the ones we create and tell ourselves about the world around us. It\u0027s easy for delusions and lies to take root and grow, and left unchecked, they can do serious harm. Do any of these sound familiar?Leadership Global Consultant and CoachTrump\u0027s brazen and popular foray into the realm of vile rhetoric has revealed a long-standing but well-hidden truth about the GOP and conservativism in the United States: right-wing thought has devolved into a disease of ignorance and hate.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyI am a half Egyptian, half white-American Muslim woman who was raised in a standard, middle-class suburb in The Middle Of Nowhere, USA. My mother and older sister wear headscarfs for various deeply personal reasons, and I do not. In truth, I don\u0027t wear a headscarf for one reason.Student, american, egyptian, muslim, musician, writer?The big news today was that Senator Lindsey Graham has decided to drop out of the presidential nomination race. But recently, what has surprised me even more, is one Hillary Clinton quote in particular about the Middle East that hasn\u0027t gotten any media attention at all.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAs our life moves at full speed all around us, we must force ourselves to slow down and take a breath. We must remind ourselves there is joy this holiday season.Mom, wife, school counselor, unlikely writer.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
