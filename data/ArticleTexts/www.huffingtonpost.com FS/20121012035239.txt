{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"In the last month, the United States hit three milestones in the war in Afghanistan. In late September, the 33,000 additional soldiers that President Obama ordered to Afghanistan in late 2009 came home. The number of U.S. soldiers killed reached 2,000. And this past Sunday marked the 11th anniversary of the longest war in American history. But the war has barely come up during a campaign that already seems interminable. Even though our presence in Afghanistan is a big drain on America\u0027s budget, in the first presidential debate last week the word came up exactly once. Will it come up in the vice-presidential debate tonight? It will of course come up on October 22nd, when the presidential debate is devoted to foreign policy. But there most likely won\u0027t be any actual debate. Because the one milestone the U.S. has not yet hit is the answer to the question: Why on earth are we still there?Read Post | Comments (104)John Hudak, 10/11/12Fellow in Governance Studies, Brookings InstitutionTonight Obama needed a champion, an advocate, and a force that did what he failed to do: show a contrast with Gov. Romney and rekindle the post-DNC enthusiasm. Joe was that force.Read Post | CommentsRobert Watson, 10/11/12Professor and director of American Studies at Lynn UniversityAfter watching this debate, I can\u0027t help but to think: Who are the folks who are still undecided?! After two years of campaigning, well over a billion dollars in spending, countless speeches, and two debates, voters have two dramatically different choices.Read Post | Comments (22)Steven Weber, 10/11/12Actor, wise-assThe American people, their attention spans scrupulously shortened to the point of an Oliver Sacks case study with three second recall, has supposedly forgotten all the crap that, from Romney and Ryan, passed for policy. But ladies and gentlemen, that\u0027s just BS.Read Post | Comments (27)Craig Crawford, 10/11/12News commentator, blogger, authorWho knows what vice presidential debates mean, but at a minimum they show us who\u0027s ready to step up if needed. Paul Ryan might be ready someday, but not now. Joe Biden\u0027s decades of experience showed. Ryan\u0027s lack of readiness was painfully apparent.Read Post | Comments (38)Jared Bernstein, 10/11/12Fmr.

You may believe you aren\u0027t at risk anymore if you\u0027re married or in a monogamous relationship. This simply isn\u0027t true.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 10/11/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistCancer is a very serious matter, and mammograms can save lives. But really, is there any medical procedure that conjures up such a mixed bag of emotions -- dread, fear, resignation and even embarrassment?Read Post | Comments (131)Gordon Brown, 10/11/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationPakistan needs to be shocked into action, with the Taliban shamed and forced into accepting the basic freedoms of every girl.Read Post | Comments (110)Cecile Richards, 10/11/12President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundIf we want to help our kids to make healthy decisions, we have to be clear about our values and about the information we give them on how to stay safe. Nowhere is this truer than those seemingly awkward conversations with teens about sex.Read Post | Comments (35)Jamal Abdi, 10/11/12Policy Director, National Iranian American CouncilThe Senate should not be handing out promises to enable foreign leaders to decide whether and when the U.S. goes to war. This would not be a mutual defense pact -- it would be a suicide pact.Read Post | Comments (35)Christy Turlington Burns and Monique Villa, 10/11/12In the time it takes to read this column, around 70 girls below 18 years old will have been forced into marriage, often with dire consequences.Read Post | Comments (146)Dan Froomkin, 10/11/12Senior Washington Correspondent, Huffington PostVeterans are \"the other one percent.\" But the tiny minority of Americans who carry the heavy burden of war face enormous challenges that neither presidential candidate is addressing.Read Post | Comments (80)Rick D. Axtell, 10/11/12Paul L. Cantrell Associate Professor of Religion, Centre CollegeOne wonders if anyone is listening to the voices of poor people in America.

Borosage, 10/11/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe bastion of high finance, the IMF, has come out against austerity. Can Mitt be far behind? Look forward to the next debate, when Romney\u0027s new \"etching\" will no doubt have him denouncing the president for his jobs program, while suddenly offering up his own version to get the economy going.Read Post | Comments (70)Jennifer Garner and Mark Shriver, 10/11/12A report card marked with too many C\u0027s and D\u0027s is not something to boast about.
