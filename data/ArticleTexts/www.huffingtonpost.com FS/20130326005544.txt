{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe path to the Supreme Court by gay marriage advocates is a lesson for every movement. What took the LGBT rights movement to this moment, and indeed what has taken us to moments of truth and potential victory more often than not, are those who went against the established leaders and groups. The couples in Hawaii in the early \u002790s, who ultimately received the support of LGBT people across the U.S., did something that had the major gay groups in Washington of the time up in arms. The groups were focused on making incremental change, mostly on getting a hate crimes bill and a watered-down employment discrimination bill passed as the first major pieces of legislation to protect gay people. The idea of fighting for marriage seemed just crazy and, to them, bound to cause a backlash that would distract them and immerse them in something they didn\u0027t plan on.Comments (145)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzRepresentative, Florida\u0027s 23rd Congressional DistrictOnly when women everywhere can stand tall and strong together in peace and security can we confidently say: Once we were slaves, and now we are free.Comments (125)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027What people do in their bedrooms shouldn\u0027t be the public\u0027s business. Women should have rights over their own bodies. Same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. But what powerful people do in their boardrooms is the public\u0027s business.Comments (95)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerIn the real world, which increasingly is becoming the virtually augmented reality world, a smartphone, a pad, or a laptop are survival tools. Even the Amish have a word processor.Comments (53)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile girl power, the movement that began in the early 90s, has aimed to empower many young girls to be ambitious, assertive, and self-reliant, that girl power as interpreted on TV and in film is slowly but surely seeping into our streets as something more sinister.Comments (263)Stewart BrandCo-founder, “Revive \u0026 Restore”; Author, Whole Earth DisciplineDeath is still forever, but extinction may not be. A dead body can\u0027t be reanimated once it begins to rot, but the essence of a species -- its genome -- survives rot for centuries, even thousands of years. That DNA knows how to make living animals, once we figure out how to invite it to do so.Comments (180)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAfter marathon and heated discussions, agreement was reached on a new rescue package for Cyprus. Compared to what had emerged a week earlier, this is a better technical outcome -- both in what it contains and in what is left out.CommentsMargaret ChoComedian, actor and recording artistDan needs some paradise right now. He is on trial for contesting and questioning Don\u0027t Ask Don\u0027t Tell, which was later repealed, yet now he has to go to court, and face some possibly harsh consequences, for speaking out against it years ago.Comments (75)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The vote on the Sanders Amendment should\u0027ve been newsworthy. Here was an opportunity for all the senators who have explicitly or implicitly supported the adoption of the chained CPI to step up and say why the switch to the chained CPI was a good and necessary measure. However, not one senator was prepared to stand up and argue the case.CommentsLuluSinger, songwriter and performerToday at 64, I firmly believe that I am ageing victoriously, in large part due to the positive examples set by those who are ageing in the spotlight.

It may seem rough, but really it\u0027s not so bad: you\u0027re just one of six million Spaniards who are unemployed today.Comments (43)Jennifer KnappGrammy-nominated, Dove-Award-winning singer and songwriterWe often confuse those who speak from lofty perches as having earned the authority to speak for the many, when if fact, they were probably just the first to grab the microphone.Comments (209)Peter G TatchellHuman rights campaignerAfter months and years of delay, in 2011 President Obama finally scrapped all restrictions on lesbian and gay people serving in the US armed forces. But only after a series of dramatic civil disobedience protests outside the White House, involving a young gay Korean American soldier.CommentsAlon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe fact that the president linked Israel\u0027s ultimate national security to the establishment of a Palestinian state is not going to move Netanyahu to change course. He is fixated on grabbing more Palestinian land.Comments (14)Fauzia BurkeFounder and President of FSB, a Web Publicity and Marketing FirmThe whole media storm over Sheryl Sandberg\u0027s book makes me wonder, why are we so set on judging each other? I know one thing from my personal experience, if you are a mom, you\u0027re working hard. None of us are better than the other.Comments (20)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio hostSchools have literally become gateways to prison, instead of gateways to learning.

KeeganPresident, People for the American WayThere is a school of thought that a broad victory for marriage equality at the Supreme Court would galvanize the opposition and end up being a setback for the gay rights movement. I disagree. The side that can\u0027t afford to win or to lose at the Supreme Court this week is the anti-gay right.Comments (32)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersUnless Americans step up the way Cypriots did and demand real regulation, as well as send the message that they don\u0027t trust Wall Street by moving their money to community banks and credit unions, they can bank on being bilked.

Vicki FlippinPastor, The Church of the VillageLent and Holy Week are not just a time to take stock of our individual lives and turn towards God. This is also a time to take stock of our life together to prune out what is not healthy or helpful, to root out what is sinful.Comments (622)David PaulPresident, Fiscal Strategies GroupIf our economic model is working for a decreasing share of the population over time, democratic pressures will ultimately demand not just changes to the system of measurement, but to the system itself.Comments (197)Ruth RileyWNBA Player and Olympic Gold MedalistAs a professional basketball player, I have had amazing opportunities to use my talents, to play with the best players in the world, and even to represent my country in the Olympics.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI suspect the Koch brothers are perfectly happy to have folks like me running around arguing about the correct deflator to use or the percent of the Ryan budget\u0027s spending cuts affecting low-income programs, while they continue to buy \"research\" that says otherwise and policies that exacerbate inequality.Comments (194)Ted JohnsonColumnist at VarietyThat swing of public opinion is a contrast to the much slower timing of past civil rights struggles, and explanations are open for debate.
