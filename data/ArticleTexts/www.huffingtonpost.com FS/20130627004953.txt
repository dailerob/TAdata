{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostNobody ever can or should be mandated to perform a religious act -- including officiating at a wedding. Want proof? Ask most Rabbis about doing an interfaith marriage. So, these conservatives who have planned to defy SCOTUS on DOMA are within their theological right (and rites) to refuse. However, there are thousands and thousands of clergy who feel that our religious rights (and rites) have been inhibited by DOMA and laws that limit the legal implications of the marriages we have performed between same sex couples. Today is a clear victory for religious freedom as it maintains the rights of clergy who say \u0027I Don\u0027t\u0027 to gay marriage, but liberates those of us who say \u0027I do.\u0027Comments (209)Jeff CohenAuthor and media criticWhen a huge swath of the country is on the side of the guy-on-the-run and not the government, it\u0027s much easier to see that there\u0027s nothing \"objective\" or \"neutral\" about journalists who so closely identify with the spy agencies or Justice Department or White House.Comments (129)Stephen SidwellFounder and CEO, LYFE Kitchen, RetailFor me, the worst part about dieting is being hungry. But what I learned is that you can\u0027t exercise a weight problem away. What started with food has to end with food.Comments (12)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWith the overturning of DOMA, it will simply be easier for states to embrace marriage equality and move past intolerance. It now becomes harder to push anti-gay policies, because there is no incentive to do so under federal law. Today is a dark day for the forces of anti-gay bigotry.Comments (44)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundThe fact of the matter is, here in Texas, we\u0027ve started something no one can stop. People don\u0027t want politicians making women\u0027s private medical decisions, cutting off access to lifesaving preventive care or safe and legal abortion -- and they absolutely will not stand for it.Comments (168)Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectAs President Obama said today, history will judge the present generation by our success or failure in meeting and surmounting this existential challenge. So I urge the nation to follow President Obama\u0027s lead and take the positive steps he announced today, but to keep fighting.Comments (574)Jay Sterling SilverLaw professor, St. Thomas University School of LawWhile Snowden\u0027s apparent escape from U.S. jurisdiction doesn\u0027t represent a happy ending for either of the parties in the case of the United States v. Snowden, the government seems to have achieved, sub rosa, the goal of any settlement: it cut its losses.Comments (62)Margaret Wheeler JohnsonWomen\u0027s EditorAs employers have gotten used to working parents leaving at a reasonable hour and not working weekends, they\u0027ve gotten used to single staffers, particularly single women, picking up the work that employees with kids won\u0027t get to.Comments (108)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostIn a state that sorely needed it, a few Texas Democrats put their foot down on the issue of women\u0027s reproductive rights and in the process likely awoke a sleeping giant.Comments (61)Aaron ZelinskyVisiting Assistant Professor, University of Maryland School of LawHere is a list of the 10 most important lines from today\u0027s Supreme Court opinions in Windsor.Comments (39)Ani VrabelAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s not a great exaggeration to say that last weekend, I walked into my own worst nightmare: the New York Turtle \u0026 Tortoise Society\u0027s annual Turtle and Tortoise Show. I had decided it was time to kick my ridiculous phobia -- and I figured an unconventional fear deserved an unconventional attempt to beat it.CommentsFrances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilPresident Obama has announced a robust plan for tackling climate change and reducing dangerous carbon pollution. This marks an historic turning point.Comments (42)Michael W. TwittyCulinary historian, Judaics teacher and food writerI am more angry about the cloud of smoke this fiasco has created for other issues surrounding race and Southern food. Culinary injustice is the annihilation of our food voices and nobody will talk about that like they are talking about you and the \"n word.\"Comments (68)Rahm EmanuelMayor of Chicago, ILCities can drive dramatic improvements on climate but we can\u0027t do it alone. As the Mayor of Chicago, I see the both the benefits of tackling this challenge and the threats that remain.Comments (12)Sean McElweeWriterThere\u0027s no excuse for America to continue on the road of inequality. Plenty of other countries have managed to grow quickly without drastic inequality. Inequality is bad for democracy, health, safety, social cohesion and social mobility. Let\u0027s not let anyone sugarcoat it.Comments (233)Jess LivelyConsultant and bloggerI believe that most of our failed attempts come from the fact that we are trying to fit ourselves into a prescribed routine that isn\u0027t capturing our real desires.Comments (11)Rajan MenonProfessor of Political Science, City College of New York/City University of New York; Non Resident Senior Fellow, The Atlantic CouncilThe road to recovery will be long even under the best of circumstances: a ceasefire that occurs within the next few months and that lasts; a stable, legitimate, and efficient post-war polity; and abundant long-term economic aid from other countries.CommentsAnya Malkov2013 Master in Public Policy graduate, John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard UniversityThe Hoeven-Corker border security plan is politically brilliant. However, the military-style enforcement surge is as far from the reality of border residents\u0027 lives as North Dakota and Tennessee are from the border itself.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkThis outrageous ruling puts African Americans, other minorities, the poor and all oppressed groups now at the mercy of state governments, yet again. It\u0027s as if we\u0027re in pre-1965 America.Comments (489)Mitchell BardWriter and FilmmakerWendy Davis\u0027s actions, while a short-term victory, don\u0027t address the moral rot at the heart of the GOP agenda, including the party\u0027s all-out assault on a women\u0027s right to choose what happens with her body.Comments (55)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (38)AnnMaura ConnollyPresident, Voices for National Service; Chief Strategy Officer and Executive Vice President, City Year, Inc.There is no excuse for turning away civilians -- especially young people -- who are looking for ways to put their energy and idealism to work for our country because there aren\u0027t adequate opportunities for them to do so.CommentsKelly LewisFounder, Go! Girl GuidesDid any of these experiences ruin my time abroad? No, but I could\u0027ve certainly done without them.CommentsKevin PowellPublic speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027We need to call it what is: There are certain people in power, specifically white males of privilege in America, who\u0027ve never believed in Dr. King\u0027s dream.Comments (36)Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe court said Tuesday that that history and those formulas are no longer relevant -- or at least not relevant enough to make sense in the multiracial America of today.Comments (1,504)Jim SleeperLecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityI have to note that so much was actually wrong with premises and strategies embodied in Sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act that you can almost say we asked for this.CommentsJonny DorseyDirector, Aspen Institute Impact Careers InitiativeAll too frequently, we struggle to communicate the value of service. The impact of service unfolds over decades and lifetimes; it\u0027s hard to measure and harder yet to squeeze into pithy sound-bites. We need those stories of individuals to really understand the power of service.CommentsRep. Earl BlumenauerU.S. Representative from OregonPresident Obama is right that we have a moral obligation to act, yet the Republicans\u0027 plan remains the same tired \"drill, baby, drill,\" which the American people know is a slogan, not a solutionComments (71)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027That an issue of this importance is being virtually ignored by our press is mind-boggling to say the least, and one has to wonder what nefarious influences the oil industry and its moneyed interests are able to bring to bear.CommentsTom DanAssociate Editor, The Huffington PostThe lack of federal acknowledgement of same-sex couples has made and continues to make my life as a twenty-six year-old foreigner with an American partner painfully and bitterly difficult. It will continue this way until the Defense of Marriage Act is repealed.CommentsMichèle FlournoySenior advisor, Boston Consulting GroupIndeed, many veterans report finding a renewed sense of mission and meaning through service here at home. For many, community service offers them a chance to reconnect to \"a mission that matters,\" to restore a sense of accomplishment and having impact, and to experience the kind of teamwork and community that reduces their sense of isolation and creates a positive sense of identity.CommentsSpencer OvertonProfessor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosVoting rights protections are still needed, and it is feasible to design up-to-date and adequate protections. While today\u0027s Supreme Court decision is a setback, Congress has the power to do the right thing and update the Voting Rights Act.Comments (73)Richard J.
