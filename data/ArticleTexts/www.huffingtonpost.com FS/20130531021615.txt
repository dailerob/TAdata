{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostIf workers now earning $8 an hour inside warehouses or at fast-food counters manage to get more pay, they are not going to hide the extra money in the Cayman Islands or leave it to their heirs via elaborate trusts. They will go out and spend it almost immediately, boosting their local economies. They will distribute their dollars at grocery stores, generating additional demand for agribusiness and the truck drivers who haul the crop to stores. They will leave their funds at hardware stores, as they address long-ignored problems in their homes; or they will perhaps hire carpenters and plumbers and electricians to do the work, enabling these professionals to buy trucks and add more workers. This additional commerce will shore up state and city coffers, enabling hard-hit school districts to add teachers to alleviate crowding. In short, lifting the fortunes of the lowest-paid workers will improve the economy for virtually everyone.Comments (633)William BaldwinActorThis shot over the bow of wrestling from the IOC could be the wakeup call we have been waiting for. Never before have I witnessed more outrage, more passion, and more interest for our beloved sport.CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThere\u0027s no doubt that Beck is a conspiracy theorist. He\u0027s a purveyor of wacky, purely fabricated gibberish leading to the ultimate conclusion that there\u0027s an unholy alliance composed of the Obama government and \"fascist\" progressives out to destroy us all.Comments (113)Mika BrzezinskiCo-host of MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\"Somewhat aspirational. I loved it. Didn\u0027t know what it meant. But I found it to be hilarious and cuttingly honest, which I admire. I considered getting a T-shirt with the words typed out across my chest.Comments (70)Tom GreenComedian, actor and Internet pioneerThank you Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg for making Schadenfreude convenient. It\u0027s as if we are enjoying the spectacle so much that we haven\u0027t noticed the cameras are now pointed at us. Who is laughing now?Comments (155)Chris BarnesWriterFor almost thirty years, the adventures of Blanche, Dorothy, Sophia and Rose entertained us. Most people can even sing the theme song. But what do we know about the house that the series was set in?Comments (142)Ester BloomWriter; Full of Pith and VinegarLike a drunk person crashing at your house, a baby may need to be carried inside; paw at your breasts, with or without other people present; and insist on telling long, incomprehensible stories.Comments (12)Conde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comA ship graveyard in Mauritania, a picturesque 16th century Italian village, a once-grand train station--we can\u0027t help but be mesmerized by these mysterious and beautiful abandoned places around the world.Comments (11)Jonathan TurleyProfessor of Public Interest Law, George Washington UniversityEric Holder\u0027s feeble response was the ultimate proof that these are Obama\u0027s sins despite his effort to feign ignorance.Comments (161)Melissa MohrAuthorOnce upon a time, the English population was decimated by the plague. The King was so concerned about the shrinking number of his subjects that he ordered his people to reproduce.Comments (45)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIf a U.S. senator can unwittingly pose for pictures with terrorists in Syria, how can we guarantee that the arms McCain supports sending there won\u0027t also end up in the same place McCain did -- with terrorists?Comments (49)Jackie Morgan MacDougallWriter/Producer/On-Air PersonalityWe try to teach our daughters to love their bodies, no matter the size. We want to empower girls to respect themselves. But how can we teach them to make strong, independent decisions about their own selves when society, peers (and yes, even parents) are sending mixed messages?Comments (664)Bill McKibbenAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027You need to see this: Former Obama administration green jobs advisor Van Jones just came out swinging against Keystone XL. Van doesn\u0027t just raise the stakes, he debunks the outright myths that are leading our nation down a road to disaster.Comments (25)Jim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupSeveral officials in the DRC told the Secretary-General and me the same line: \"We are a rich country with the poorest people.\" What they didn\u0027t say was that the DRC is a rich country with people thirsty for peace.CommentsJaime WooAuthor, \"Meet Grindr\"Mad Men has a habit of bringing in minor characters who signal the broader theme for the following season. With bloggers Tom and Lorenzo suggesting that Bob Benson might be gay, his sudden appearance in Season 6 could allude to next season\u0027s big theme.Comments (25)Tracy MiddendorfActress; Founder, Shutter to ThinkEducation is a pretty basic right. If we can\u0027t make sure it\u0027s available to everyone, we\u0027re not doing so well.CommentsDanny RubinManaging Editor, News To Live ByYou\u0027re halfway through the most formative decade of your life. You don\u0027t need all the answers, but you must keep asking questions. Start with this one: What\u0027s something new that I can learn right now?Comments (82)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m happy to announce that next week, on June 6th, Mika Brzezinski and I will be co-hosting the Huffington Post’s first-ever women\u0027s conference, \"The Third Metric: Redefining Success Beyond Money \u0026 Power.\"Comments (106)Jamal Abdi and Trita ParsiAs Iran approaches another presidential election, and as Iran\u0027s government steps up its efforts to silence and impede free expression, the people of Iran will know that -- at least when it comes to access to communications tools -- the U.S. government will no longer be standing in their way.Comments (27)Laura CococciaEditor, \u0027The Journal of Cultural Conversation\u0027Sarah and I reconnected recently to talk about how to achieve the \"zen\" that comes with leaving sugar behind. She shared how sugar can make our minds us edgier and less clear, and revealed the ways to overcome cravings on the road to resetting our bodies from sugar dependency.Comments (33)Tom Frieden, MD, MPHDirector, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)The basic tools of disease tracking and data analysis -- which CDC\u0027s disease detectives and others relied on to eradicate smallpox, identify Legionnaires\u0027 disease, and stop SARS -- remain essential. But they are no longer enough.Comments (12)Allison TateAuthor, mother of fourAs a mother who does not work for pay, I\u0027m not sure how to define success in my everyday. Catching up with the laundry? Getting the kids out the door without any screaming or crying from anyone, including me?Comments (40)Alex CastellanosRepublican media consultantTimes have changed. Our government hasn\u0027t. New Republicans believe we can fix that and, in so doing, make America young again. The government won\u0027t be fixed by itself. It needs smart, young leaders to tackle the problems this nation currently faces.Comments (75)James ClearEntrepreneur, weightlifter, and travel photographerRecently, I\u0027ve been following a simple rule that is helping me crush procrastination and making it easier for me to stick to good habits at the same time. I want to share it with you today so that you can try it out and see how it works in your life.Comments (85)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersIt\u0027s hard to go back to representing bankers when you have just been prosecuting them. To get at the root of our problems, we\u0027re going to have hold K Street accountable, not just government.CommentsDan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostMichele Bachmann in many ways is the perfect representation of the Tea Party: Loud, hateful and ultimately, inconsequential.Comments (47)Richard Besser, M.D.ABC News Chief Health and Medical EditorOn Friday, I have the honor of moderating an incredible panel discussion on the progress that has been made to understand AIDS, how that was accomplished, and what it will take to finally end the AIDS epidemic.CommentsDr. James HansenClimatologistOur government has failed to address climate, energy, and economic challenges, but our democracy and economic system still have great potential for innovation and rapid adoption of improved technologies, if the government provides the right conditions and gets out of the way.Comments (79)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Even as the economy slowly recovers from the worst downturn since the Great Depression, government-haters and deficit-hawks are sticking to their same story: Americans have lived beyond their means and must now learn to live within them. The reality is quite different.Comments (123)Dean PraetoriusDirector of Trends and Social Media, The Huffington PostPerhaps the rumors of the social media editor\u0027s demise have been greatly exaggerated. In our newsroom, at least, the role is very much alive and well.CommentsMichael T. KlareAuthor and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeDid Washington just give Israel the green light for a future attack on Iran via an arms deal? Did Russia just signal its further support for Bashar al-Assad\u0027s Syrian regime via an arms deal?Comments (17)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.30.05Jay Weston, 2013.30.05Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013.30.05Christopher Elliott, 2013.30.05Marten Weber, 2013.30.05Danielle Ripley-Burgess, 2013.30.05Tracy Middendorf, 2013.30.05Jason Salzman, 2013.30.05Amy Hollingsworth, 2013.30.05Allison O\u0027Kelly, 2013.30.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"END OF THE LINE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
