{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"My book tour has officially been crowdsourced... and we have our winners! After nearly 400,000 votes were cast, you have decided that I\u0027ll be going deep into the heart of Texas, to Harlem, and to the campus of Stony Brook University on Long Island to talk about the issues contributing to our country\u0027s slow slide into Third World America. I also want to remind everyone about the webcast we\u0027ll be hosting next Wednesday, October 6, at 8:30 pm EST to talk about the problems facing America\u0027s beleaguered middle class -- and the steps we can all take to turn things around. Anyone with an Internet connection can join the event -- but we think the best way to be a part of it is to host or sign up for a HuffPost Meetup.

Can\u0027t hear you!\" loud noises. The filibustering is unmatched on the Democratic side. The brazen, hubristic flaunting of obvious hypocrisy is unmatched. But still, it\u0027s \"both sides.\"Read Post | CommentsJane Hamsher, 09.30.2010Founder, FireDogLake.comWhat Obama is facing, which other presidents have not, is moment-by-moment online documentation of the distance between his words and his actions by issue advocates on his own side.Read Post | CommentsMaria Bello, 09.30.2010ActressIn Haiti, 53 women are running for Congress and Senate who could change the dynamic of the rebuilding of Haiti.

Elisberg, 09.30.2010Columnist and screenwriterO\u0027Keefe\u0027s efforts to lure a CNN reporter into a videotaped sex den have rightly been ridiculed as laughable.

On parole.Read Post | CommentsTom Engelhardt, 09.30.2010Editor of TomDispatch.comLike people bingeing on anything, the present Pentagon and military cast of characters can\u0027t stop themselves.
