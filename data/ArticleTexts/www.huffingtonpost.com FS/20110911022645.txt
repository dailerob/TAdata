Hilda Solis, 9/9/11U.S. Secretary of LaborOn this weekend\u0027s solemn anniversary, we honor the sacrifices of our first responders who ran into burning buildings while others ran out. The selflessness of our firefighters, police, EMTs and hazmat workers who were first on the scene inspired the world.Read Post | Comments (14)James Zogby, 9/10/11President, the Arab American Institute; Author, \"Arab Voices\"Ten years have now passed since that fateful September day, and just as it hurts to recall the horror and the death and profound sense of loss we suffered back then, it is as painful to think of all that we have lost and the damage we have done to so many others and to ourselves in the decade that followed.Read Post | Comments (48)Robert Klitzman, M.D., 9/10/11Professor of clinical psychiatry, Director of the Masters of Bioethics Program, Columbia University.Ten years ago, my sister died at the World Trade Center.

We\u0027re wiser -- in some ways But wen we retell the story of 9/11, we generally gloss over the fact that some of the first responders who died might have lived.Read Post | Comments (44)Derek Henry Flood, 9/9/11Independent Editor, Writer and PhotojournalistA decade of talking about who has won and who has lost is both immaterial and intellectually childish. It was never about winning or losing. It is about carrying on with life. Getting on with the business of this awkwardly, unevenly integrating world.Read Post | Comments (11)Mark Hyman, MD, 9/10/11Practicing physicianWhat can you do to help your child and what can we do as a nation to raise a smarter, fitter, happier generation of children?
