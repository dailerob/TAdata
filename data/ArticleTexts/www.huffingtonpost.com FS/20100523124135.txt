{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington PostThis week, after months of intense lobbying from corporate interests, the Senate passed a financial reform bill that is that D.C. specialty: \"reform\" that\u0027s been watered down within an inch of its life. Yes, it will create a much-needed Consumer Financial Protection Agency and requires an audit of the Fed. But it doesn\u0027t end \"too big to fail\" banks, doesn\u0027t create a 21st century Glass-Steagall firewall, and leaves open dangerous loopholes in the regulation of derivatives. And we can expect more loopholes to be inserted as the bill heads to conference committee. In public, the big banks groused. In private, they counted their record profits, watched their stocks go up after the Senate vote, and agreed that the $1.4 million a day the finance industry spent lobbying Congress -- including putting 70 former members of Congress and 940 former federal employees on its lobbying payroll -- was money well spent.Read Post | CommentsBill Maher, 05.21.2010Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"New Rule: The Republican leadership in America must produce their birth certificates!
