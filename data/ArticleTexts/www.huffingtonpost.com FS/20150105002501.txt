{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week we said goodbye to Mario Cuomo. He was an electrifying speaker -- not just because of his style but because of the rich language, the erudition, and especially the soul he brought to his speeches. As he demonstrated in his famous speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, shining a light on what we can do better doesn\u0027t have to be disheartening, it can also inspire. \"There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces that you don\u0027t see, in the places that you don\u0027t visit in your shining city,\" he said, addressing Ronald Reagan. \"You ought to know that this nation is more a \u0027Tale of Two Cities\u0027 than it is just a \u0027Shining City on a Hill.\u0027\" We also bid farewell to 2014, which I\u0027ll remember as the year that awareness of how mindfulness can enhance well-being reached a tipping point. Here\u0027s to a New Year in which our inner resilience and wisdom can help us meet the challenges ahead.We\u0027ve all had New Year\u0027s resolutions that we\u0027ve broken. One year, I resolved to learn how to touch-type instead of hunting and pecking for each key. How\u0027d that turn out? I am hunting and pecking this right now. Time and time again when I went for it alone, I\u0027d get busy or just let it go. But the resolution I kept?Chief Operating Officer, FacebookAll three meanings of \"resolution\" are wonderfully attractive to me -- and timely for this brand new year.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersLike many moms, I am often so worried about wrapping presents, preparing the holiday dinner and making sure everyone is happy that making sure everyone is healthy doesn\u0027t always make it to the top of the list.National Sounds of Pertussis® Campaign Ambassador, actress and mother of twoCongress long ago learned that public scrutiny makes it harder to pass bad bills. So in the midst of negotiations to avoid another government shut-down earlier this month both houses of Congress rammed through new sanctions against Russia as part of the misnamed \"Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014.\"Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWell we did it. Made it through another year. Women have had some good news and some bad news with a bit of the ridiculous thrown in. So let\u0027s review some items affecting the female sex both here and abroad that didn\u0027t make the front pages in 2014.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsDespite the House Republican leadership\u0027s vigorous defense of Scalise Tuesday on the notion that the appearance was a regrettable, long ago, solitary honest mistake by a decent public servant important, uncomfortable questions remain.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityRather than feeling deflated and defeated by the passing of any stage in life, we might better direct our energy to the challenges before us. As with each New Year, every major life transition should be a time to think about what we have gained and celebrate our progress.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachWhen anyone of us resolves toward self-improvement, it can impact the lives of those we love. How much more impact can we have, if in the new year we work to recreate the future of this country we love, by resolving to take bold steps in a new direction in a new year?Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateInstead of creating an endless list of New Year\u0027s resolutions that I will naturally not complete -- because let\u0027s be honest, we are all way too ambitious on Jan. 1 -- I choose one word that will be my word, my way of life, for the year to come.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThe American people are living in the grip of a psychosis. We have become divorced from reality, and thereby divorced from our better selves, consumed by an extreme and irrational fear rooted in the trauma of 9/11. It has been stoked by our leaders who themselves share in it.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghSome months back, Senate Republicans blocked -- for the third time -- the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill proposing to close the pay gap between men and women. The goal of the bill -- the attainment of equal pay for equal work -- seems like a no-brainer, right? Yet not a single Republican voted in favor of the Act.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarPoll after poll shows that the American people support a progressive agenda that addresses income and wealth inequality, that creates the millions of jobs we desperately need, that raises the minimum wage, that ends pay discrimination against women, and that makes sure all Americans can get the quality education they need.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontNo pregnant woman should be forced to choose between her job and a healthy pregnancy. Yet at Walmart, the largest employer in America, and many other companies across the country, that is exactly what\u0027s happening.Co-Founder \u0026 Co-President, A Better Balance: The Work and Family Legal CenterVice President and General Counsel, National Women\u0027s Law CenterEven if we will not prosecute Cheney and the CIA, we should disbar and suspend Alberto Gonzales, who is in private practice, Jay Bybee who is now a federal appeals court judge and John Yoo who is a law professor at UC Berkeley.Trial lawyer, authorMost of us would love to be morning people. We\u0027ve heard about the benefits of waking up early time and time again. But it\u0027s easier said than done, and good intentions alone don\u0027t go very far. You need actionable, can-do strategies to make lasting change.Have 40+ books, a podcast, 30 info products, teach how to make life \u0026 biz EASY. Also into travel, growth, reading, dancing. INFJ. Say hi! :)America is not going backwards on these issues; we are going forward. And you ought to get in step with where we are headed as a nation together.President, National Action NetworkIt is time to reject the failed policies of the past and chart a new course that will better serve America\u0027s interests and improve the lives of Cubans and their families. And President Obama\u0027s decision to normalize relations with Cuba is the right approach.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaDynamic scoring is the magical-mystery math Republicans have been pushing since they came up with supply-side \"trickle-down\" economics. It\u0027s based on the belief that cutting taxes unleashes economic growth and thereby produces additional government revenue.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Let me be frank: Losing weight is not going to make you eternally happy. Temporarily, your pants size may be smaller, but all of your problems will remain.Senior at Barnard College. paulinapinsky.wordpress.comThe most ridiculous comments seem to come from Republicans and I would defy anyone to say otherwise. I have yet to see anyone come up with a list of comments from liberals that comes close, in volume or content, to lists of stupid things Republicans or conservatives say on a fairly regular and consistent basis.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire at www.zombeckink.com and contributes to www.nowitcounts.comIt was almost closing time when I met Tom.
