{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From lawprofessorblogs.comFrom mojo4music.comAll this week, along with our new posts, we\u0027re featuring some of our favorite blog posts from the past year. So enjoy this blast from the HuffPost past -- and be sure to check out The Blog for the latest current takes from our bloggers, including Les Whitten\u0027s eulogy for Jack Anderson, Bob Burnett on the year that was, Tom D\u0027Antoni on the end of political humor, Joel Makower on the Dalai Lama and the rivers of Tibet, Marshall Grossman on \"Martial Law?\", and Craig Crawford on our \"Jack Bauer\" president.READ POST | comments (22)12.27.2005 Les WhittenJack Anderson was my boss, my co-byliner, my infuriator and my dear friend over the course of 35 tumultuous years. I believe I knew him as well, maybe better, than anyone outside his family.READ POST | comments12.27.2005 Eric FischlREAD POST | comments (23)12.27.2005 Norman SolomonThe entire purpose of the NSA surveillance was to help the White House gain leverage, by whatever means possible, for a resolution in the U.N. Security Council to green light an invasion.READ POST | comments (26)06.28.2005 Larry DavidAfter our stem cell research gives us the cure for all these diseases, they’ll all be trying to get across the border for our medicine, but our minutemen won’t let them. And we’ll have a lot of minutemen.READ POST06.21.2005 Norman MailerSince George W. is not only a horse\u0027s ass, but vain and platitudinous to boot, it can hardly escape us that he is also serving (with all due inner incandescence) as God\u0027s chosen envoy for America.READ POST06.21.2005 Vernon JordanThe conviction of Edgar Ray Killen is a vindication of the truth that \"the wheels of justice grind slowly, but exceedingly fine.\"READ POST06.14.2005 Walter CronkiteI am joining the hundreds of thousands who shall be marching in the Virtual March on Washington to Stop Global Warming in order to demonstrate the concern that we all hold for the future of our planet and all the living things -- flora, fauna, human and animal -- that exist upon it.READ POST06.17.2005 Paul ReiserI\u0027m driving with my two boys -- 9 and 4 -- Springsteen playing. I’ve been not-so-subtly trying to get their musical tastes lined up with my own.READ POST06.13.2005 Adam McKayCosmo and its quizzes have gone a long way toward helping fix the human race. So I thought I’d employ the same method to find out how close minded we are as individuals...READ POST06.21.2005 Arthur Schlesinger Jr.The scandal of evangelical proselytizing at a government institution and at public expense has generated, not outrage, but lethargic indifference, with few exceptions, on the part of the media and the Department of Defense.READ POST06.04.2005 Patricia HeatonWhen my dear friend, Janet Grillo, parks her car in front of my house, I never worry about her \"Recall Bush\" bumper sticker sullying my reputation in the neighborhood. Likewise, she stomachs the \"Refuse to Choose\" pro-life sticker on my bumper.READ POST06.03.2005 Jesse KornbluthHidden in the \"Leave No Child Behind\" Act is a demand for public high schools to give contact information for its students to military recruiters. If it refuses, it could lose federal funds -- and, in effect, leave all its students behind...READ POST06.03.2005 Jonathan AlterLast week I argued for a new kind of politics in this country that revolves around embryonic stem cell research. No one came forward with what I had hoped -- a plan to build a political movement. Am I missing something?READ POST06.01.2005 Harry ShearerTough as you might want to be during an interview (here, Bush 41 and Barbara), you still gotta take the opportunity to see if the interviewee might want to speak at a charity dinner you\u0027re emceeing.READ POST06.23.2005 Arianna HuffingtonWith two to three soldiers and dozens of Iraqis dying each and every day, his smug verbal pirouettes are no longer so endearing.READ POST06.20.2005 Jon Robin BaitzThe writer who dares to take on his own past has to be really fucking careful. Memory can get you into a lot of trouble because it involves these things called Other People.READ POST06.15.2005 Danielle CrittendenThere are those who return to Guantanamo again and again who will tell you: It’s not just a resort. It’s a way of life.READ POST06.02.2005 Matt CooperI was delighted to see that a bipartisan group of attorneys general from the states and the District of Columbia have filed a brief to the Supreme Court asking them to take the case that I’ve brought to the high court.READ POST06.09.2005 Jann WennerHoward Dean says that the Republicans are essentially a party that is by, for, and of the white Christians -- which we all know is fundamentally true -- and all of a sudden we have Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi chiding him. Our guys are doing the work of the so-called GOP Echo Machine.READ POST06.27.2005 Sen. Evan BayhIt doesn’t take a degree in economics to know that something is wrong when it takes $30 or $40 to fill up the gas tank.READ POST06.28.2005 Bob BarrGiving the FBI this kind of carte blanche fishing–expedition power, and making this a permanent part of our law no matter who is in the White House is not just wrong, it\u0027s foolish. And it certainly isn\u0027t conservative.READ POST06.24.2005 Paul FeigWhile I know there is no separation of church and news and Billy Graham is a famous figure, does anybody else find it just a tad odd that a network news show would be using a religious revival as a backdrop?READ POST06.07.2005 Gary HartWe know that it took a year and a half, and the 9.11 attacks, for the president finally to accept our pre-9.11 recommendation to create a Department of Homeland Security. But few, if any, of the other 49 recommendations have so-far been adopted.READ POST06.13.2005 Brad HallIn my dream Mr. Bush explained that he had been talking to God and then, weeping like Jimmy Swaggart caught with a whore, he said that God had reminded him that lying was a sin, and that He would not longer tolerate it in his administration. Good dream, right? Well, it got better...READ POST06.23.2005 Jerry and Joe LongThere are times in your life when you just wish you had a large polo mallet on hand. Happened to be at NBC in Rockefeller Center yesterday, when who should come trundling toward us but Karl Rove.READ POST06.28.2005 Rob LongIt suddenly seemed to me that a life spent surfing the Net in slack-jawed stupor, or revising an ever-lengthening enemies list, or staring into the middle distance robotically eating deep-fried snacks, was probably a life that could use a little fine-tuning in the care-and-feeding-of-the-soul department.READ POST06.23.2005 Trey EllisA man was running down the middle of my narrow street screaming, “Help! Help!” Was this some sort of odd scam? Was a well-dressed Spaniard trying to carjack my gorgeous 1973 Mustang Mach I convertible?READ POST06.28.2005 John ZogbyIn many ways, this season of discontent resembles 1992, when voters turned on another President Bush. But the more apt comparison may not be 1992, but the period immediately following World War Two.READ POSTAP/Alaa al-MarjaniFrom muslimwakeup.comAPFrom 11alive.comNASA/JPL-Caltech/P.S.
