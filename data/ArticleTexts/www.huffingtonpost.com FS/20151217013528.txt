{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureAs always, the first casualty of the debate was the truth. The fact is that America has the most powerful military in the world. Our domestic security capacities are greater than ever. Our intelligence agencies suffer from collecting too much data not too little. Our allies get a free ride. We lack not weaponry but wisdom. Republicans scorn the real and present threat of catastrophic climate change, even as its cost in lives and resources soars. We have a debate on national security without even mention of the global stagnation that now threatens a return to global recession or worse. We got a large helping of fear and loathing last night in Las Vegas. Time will tell which candidate fared the best. But we already know that the Republic was not well served.So here\u0027s the big idea I think will shape 2016: sleep. That\u0027s right, sleep! How much and how well we sleep in the coming year -- and the years to follow -- will determine, in no small measure, our ability to address and solve the problems we\u0027re facing as individuals and as a society.Directed by J.J. Abrams, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the seventh Star Wars installment (though \"Episode VII\" has been curiously absent from the marketing), the first to be released by the franchise\u0027s new minders at Disney, and the first to follow on from the events of the beloved original trilogy that concluded with 1983\u0027s Return of the Jedi.Media Scholar and Critic, zakiscorner.comFor those who voluntarily join from abroad, ISIS is a joyful revolutionary movement bonded in blood.Director of Research in Anthropology at France\u0027s National Center of Scientific ResearchAlthough I often disagree with Justice Scalia, and although I emphatically disagree with him about the constitutionality of affirmative action, the outrage and condemnation sparked by this comment is completely unwarranted.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe bigoted, xenophobic rhetoric Donald Trump is giving Republican voters is exactly what they want. This deterioration of the GOP base is something the other candidates, and even media pundits, are still in denial about. That is why they\u0027re losing. Trump is the only one who has recognized it, and he\u0027s right.Pakistani-Canadian writer, physician and musicianAs a Black-American in the Muslim community, I have observed and been subjected to racism and micro-aggressions that exists among non-black Muslim populations perpetrated on one another and the Black community.Muslim, African-American, Interfaith Presenter, Blogger, Seeker of Truth, Promoting Consciousness, Driven by Intuition, Tar Heel Born and BredThe Republican electorate is the problem, not the candidates. The candidates are trapped in a world that is dominated by anger and alienation, not a contest of ideas or even personalities.Senior Fellow, DemosMost of us haven\u0027t quite realized there is something extraordinary happening. Silently, people are being woken up and are realizing how crazy it is to live in this society. With the advent of the Internet, the small are no longer speechless. There is a voice.Co-creator, Baobbá LabThe fact that the newest Star Wars film, directed by JJ Abrams, has casted an even more diverse and inclusive set of leaders for the film only serves to elevate the timelessness of the message of \"The Force\" as an agent for social change.President and CEO, The California EndowmentAs the primary season quickly approaches, it is clear that the women of America could decide this election. Most probably, the choice will be between electing the first woman president, who happens to be the most experienced and competent of all candidates, or Donald Trump.Lawyer/international trade consultant specializing in the Middle East, former senior government official and law professorThe deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process appears to be illogical and unsettling as a majority of Israelis and Palestinians realize that coexistence, whether under conditions of enmity or friendship, is a fact that neither side can change short of a catastrophe.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUOne of my favorite posters at Facebook says, \"Nothing At Facebook Is Someone Else\u0027s Problem.\" The inequities that persist are everyone\u0027s problem -- gender inequality harms men and women, racism hurts whites and minorities, and equal opportunity benefits us all.The best answer to any questionAt the rate of 90 more Americans killed by guns every day and more high profile mass shootings every week, we may no longer risk going to Star Wars or the movies in the future.President, Meredith ManagementThe recent Planned Parenthood attack, committed by a non-Muslim, was terrorism. The Charleston church massacre, carried out by another non-Muslim, was terrorism. The Sandy Hook shooting, in which 26 people lost their lives, was also terrorism.Political reporter covering the Bernie Sanders campaignWe are told again and again that the size of the civilian arsenal is somewhere above 300 million and climbing fast. Since we don\u0027t have anything close to universal (or even partial) gun registration, this number comes from a somewhat creative extrapolation.Mike the Gun GuyWe have learned through our forefathers that hate does not last, and love and truth eventually overcome. You may feel big by attacking us, but with each blow you only strengthen our resolve. You have bullied our children in schools, attacked our places of worship all in your skewed misinformed and small view of the world.Writer, Sikh, IT ProfessionalWe do NOT need a nuclear triad. The vague talk at the GOP debate is matched by similarly vague discussions about the triad at hearings and in official statements. This posturing inflates the value of these weapons and obscures their threat to our own security.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027Following the debate was like listening to presidential candidates who consider that the most important issue facing the United States of America is to \"beat ISIS.\" They did not even realize that, by doing so, they were giving ISIS the golden keys to the kingdom: the ability to define our policies.Chairman and CEO, Galileo Global Advisors and Adjunct professor at Columbia Law SchoolChildren are so easily influenced by what they see and hear adults do and say, that it is frightening to me to consider the longer term impact all of the hate mongering that has recently been going on in the United States.World of Children Award Co-Founder \u0026 Board ChairSleep research that we have conducted at Brigham and Women\u0027s Hospital in Boston has shown that healthy individuals sleep for far shorter periods of time when they are living at home than when they are in a controlled setting where they must remain in bed for longer than they usually do at home.Physician; Associate Professor at The Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical SchoolToday\u0027s topics include: Ted Cruz Will Not Be the Nominee; Trump is Destroying the GOP; Trump Says He Would\u0027ve Stopped the Paris Terrorists with His Gun; and much more.Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Writer for Salon.comThe dominant theme of last night\u0027s Republican debate was that only a \"tough\" Republican president who radically increases Pentagon spending can make America safe again. But throwing more money at the Pentagon will not make us safer.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyHere are nine reasons why you (and I, and every else) need to stop stigmatizing people with mental illness.Composer/Lyricist, Singer/Pianist, Teacher, Graduate Student, Mental Health AdvocateCruz is just another rightwing political with reactionary and even ugly views. He will either win or lose but either way his candidacy does not pose a mortal threat to the democratic system. For better or worse, he is just another politician. Compared to Trump, he is infinitely better.Worked on Capitol Hill for Democratic Senators and House members for 20 yearsThe Long War Doctrine -- advanced by Pentagon planners and neoconservatives almost 10 years ago -- projects up to 80 years of US military intervention to \"win\" the battle with radical jihadists. The implications are almost unthinkable to most Americans, or at least they have been until now.Former State Senator and leader of sixties peace, justice and environmental movement. Director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center.Tomorrow\u0027s climate will still be unlike anything our current civilization grew up with. But we now see a path to a different future and we have taken the first courageous steps along that path. My glass is half-full, with French champagne.President, Pacific InstituteWe have a budget problem in Pennsylvania. You could call it a budget \"crisis,\" but that makes it sound like it just sort of happened, like a hurricane or male pattern baldness. You could call it a budget \"impasse,\" but that suggests two grown up sides that can\u0027t find a compromise. Perhaps budget \"screwup\" or budget \"failure so stupid it is raising the collective blood pressure of the entire state.\"Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comThe new fear tactic encouraging Democrats and progressives to vote for Hillary at all costs rests upon the frightening notion of Donald Trump as president. The reality is that both Clinton and Trump would make similar presidents. Pertaining to Clinton\u0027s record on key issues like foreign policy and war (presidents have the power of the AUMF, allowing a president to wage unilateral wars) and ties to Wall Street, Donald Trump wouldn\u0027t be an entirely different president.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comFor some time, we have seen a growing climate of intimidation in Israel aimed at silencing non-governmental organizations that monitor human rights and report on the situation in the Palestinian Territory.Author, \u0027Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\u0027I think that the answer is no, although interestingly enough, George Lucas has never expressly addressed the topic, which makes it difficult to get a definitive answer.Writer and founder of legendsrevealed.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
