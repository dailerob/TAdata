{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Authors, Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer—And Turned Its Back on the Middle ClassWhen President Obama said this week that he was forced to negotiate with hostage-takers, it seemed as if this bitter tax fight had just emerged. In reality, the hostage takers laid their \"trap\" a decade ago. Unfortunately, most reporters have done a lousy job of reminding us of its background. Why were the tax cuts of 2001 scheduled to expire? Because the Bush administration could not convince enough Senators back then that they were affordable. The GOP\u0027s gamble was that when the tax cuts were due to expire, they would be extended because too many in Washington would be afraid to \"raise taxes.\" It now looks like their bet paid off.Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 12.09.2010Political organizer, strategist and authorBehind any big historic political bargain there are usually big, bottom-line self interests.
