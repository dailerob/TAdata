{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe horrendous killings of three young Muslim-American university students near the University of North Carolina by an atheist man Tuesday evening has prompted authorities there to look at the incident as a possible hate crime. The hate-crime designation carries profound importance for communities, whether informally, in a crime report, or in a criminal charge. The killings come at a time when Muslims in the United State have been the focus of efforts to stop mosque construction, enact targeted anti-Sharia state laws (which are already redundant under the First Amendment), and negatively stereotype Muslims in social discourse. Last week a Muslim-American civic ceremony at the Texas Capitol in Austin was disrupted by protestors. A 2014 Pew survey showed that Muslims are the most negatively regarded religious group in the nation.It\u0027s all too predictable that some Muslims, as tragically disturbed and misguided as alleged Chapel Hill killer Craig Stephen Hicks seemingly is, will take matters into their own hands. That\u0027s one thing I\u0027m afraid of. But I\u0027m also afraid of the opposite -- that Muslim communities around the US will be terrorized into cowering timidity.Author, \u0027Alive and Well in Pakistan\u0027The sensationalist tendencies of our contemporary global media have offered an ideal echo chamber for the warped and corrupt ideologies of these militant groups.

Here are nine ways they are extremely similar...Blog Editor, The Huffington PostSex in the late 70s was a big deal. The only thing my friends and I worried about was losing our virginity. Today, in 2015, we as a society still think of ourselves as being into sex. But honestly, we\u0027re not. We\u0027re mostly done with sex being number-one in awesomeness. Let\u0027s look at what happened.Emmy-nominated writer with world’s second-highest IQ. 25 years as a bar bouncer. Has developed an alternative to the Big Bang Theory.I did something shameful Monday morning because I felt pressed for time, but if I had just taken 11 seconds to breathe I could\u0027ve avoided the whole mishegas.

These do not arise from experiences within the system, and from adult perceptions, that focus on failure.CEO, National CASA AssociationThe responsibility for educating students is not the students\u0027 alone.

Here he offers his thoughts on the future of positive news, technology\u0027s role in the spread of ideas and the powerful emotions that drive us to share.Democrats are encouraged to hear Republicans co-opting our rhetoric on the economy and we stand at the ready to work with Republicans to get things done for the middle class. But only when Republican policy proposals catch up to their rhetoric will we have an opportunity for real solutions.Democratic U.S. Senator from New YorkMy name is Brianna Wu. I develop video games for your phone. I lead one of thelargest professional game-development teams of women in the field. Sometimes I speak out on women in tech issues. I\u0027m doing everything I can to save my life except be silent.News, entertainment, lifestyle siteYes, Williams is a newsman and an anchor, and holding him to the highest standard goes with the territory. But he\u0027s a human first, and drastic ironies and imperfections come with that territory. Wouldn\u0027t we be a gentler, more educative culture if, instead of wallowing in Williams\u0027 shame, we treated it as an opportunity to examine the nature of the humanity we have in common?Founder, People for the American WayJust because people, particularly in this instance, self-serving conservative Republican men in party leadership, fail to acknowledge sexism and gender discrimination that is as clear as the noses on their faces, doesn\u0027t mean media should too.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)We\u0027re actually happiest when we\u0027re absorbed in a difficult task, one that challenges us not only to exercise our talents but to stretch them. And yet, given the opportunity, we\u0027ll eagerly relieve ourselves of the rigors of labor.Author, The Glass Cage: Automation and UsIt\u0027s hard to imagine the television late-night landscape without Stewart\u0027s voice and biting humor, and he will be sorely missed. But when Comedy Central looks to replace him, we hope they hire a woman.Senior Editor, HuffPost WomenI was able to sleep more peacefully because of my soul mate Jon. Okay, I also had a relationship with Stephen Colbert who was like the wacky genius uncle of the family. They forever changed the way we get our news, and they redefined TV truth.WriterTaking the \"random acts of kindness\" concept and applying it with a Valentine\u0027s Day twist is not only a wonderful way to delight someone else, but in the act of giving, you will be blessed by the joy of service. Here are some suggestions of ways to give on Valentine\u0027s Day.Harpist, Eternal OptimistOur Valentine\u0027s Day heartthrob is none other than whistleblower Edward Snowden! You may be wondering why we\u0027re crushing so hard after Ed, so here you\u0027ll find four reasons that you should have a crush on him too.Communications Director, Brave New FoundationAfter the debacle that was the 2015 Oscar nominations, in which Black-centric movies were denied nominations for Best Picture, many hoped that the Grammys would offer the unbiased recognition of diverse talent the Oscars so staunchly avoids. Then Beck beat out Beyoncé for Album of the Year.Student and campus-editor-at-large, University of AlabamaAs a Hospice volunteer, I spend every Tuesday with people who are dying. I cook their meals; hold their hands; read to them; I sing and I sit quietly. I tell them stories and I listen to theirs.
