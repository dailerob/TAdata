{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic RelationsThe transition from Jim Jones to Thomas Donilon as National Security Advisor is unlikely to change anything of paramount importance. Donilon is not an ideas man at a time when a fresh strategic perspective is essential for breaking from our self destructive behavior in Afghanistan/Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Palestine and in the pervasive \u0027war on terror\u0027 generally.
