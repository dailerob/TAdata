{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonOn Tuesday I\u0027ll be guest-hosting CNBC\u0027s Squawk Box. As well as discussing Cyprus and a possible euro-crisis, we are going to discuss the growing trend in corporate America to take steps -- meditation, yoga, mindfulness trainings -- to reduce stress and improve health and creativity. Even a quick look at what\u0027s happening in the American workplace shows that it\u0027s a seriously split-screen world. On the one hand, there\u0027s the stressful world of quarterly earnings reports, beating growth expectations, hard-charging CEOs, and focusing on the bottom line -- the world that is the usual focus of CNBC and Squawk Box. On the other hand, there\u0027s the world populated by the growing awareness of the costs of stress, not just in the health and well-being of business leaders and employees, but on the bottom line as well.Comments (14)Alec BaldwinActorHow do I convey this without offending the gay community, or women who are supportive of more women in politics, or those who believe that Michael Bloomberg was a great mayor for New York? It may be impossible, but here goes. Christine Quinn is not qualified to be mayor of New York.Comments (210)Keli GoffAuthor and political correspondent, TheRoot.comParents shouldn\u0027t be raising boys who rape, and I wish they wouldn\u0027t, but ultimately I have very little control over that. The one thing I can control is how much I drink, and how much I encourage others to drink, or rather discourage others to drink -- and not just young women.Comments (681)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The failure to see the largest asset bubble in the history of the world, coupled with the failure to prescribe an effective remedy to deal with the damage, should be sufficient to earn the economics profession the contempt of right-thinking people everywhere.CommentsEvan HandlerActor, author, screenwriter, and journalistI am tired to the bone of the baseless and uninformed criticisms people continue to hurl toward the Livestrong Foundation, based on crimes Lance committed as a cyclist.Comments (51)Amanda OrrCommunications Consultant, Freelance WriterWhen our daughter was born, she was beautiful and she screamed. A lot. We brought her home, she kept screaming, and we told ourselves it was normal. But then it wasn\u0027t normal.Comments (65)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOOn Saturday, European officials stunned Cypriots (and many others) by announcing a rescue package for their country that involves a levy on all bank deposits. The news is spreading far and wide, causing quite a bit of controversy in the process.Comments (304)Kim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comTeach your boys that bravery can be terrifying. Courage can be demanded of you at the most inopportune times. Let them know that your expectation is that they are brave enough to rise to the occasion. And show them how.Comments (28)Geoffrey DunnAuthor, \u0027The Lies of Sarah Palin\u0027It should have come as no surprise to anyone who has watched Sarah Palin\u0027s erratic and dysfunctional behavior over the past four-and-a-half years that when it comes to Republican Party loyalty, she has none.Comments (321)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027There\u0027s no reason why Generations Y and Z can\u0027t enjoy the same economic tailwind that my generation did. That, however, will not just happen. It requires a politics -- and not the politics of young versus old, much less the politics of austerity.Comments (763)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhenever I say that, I get emails from people who don\u0027t believe it, and not just complaining conservatives. Well, here are the numbers.Comments (293)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington Post\"Bow Down\" is sort of a sad moment. If a 17-time Grammy winner who inked a $50 million-deal with Pepsi feels like she\u0027s still in the shadow of her spouse, what\u0027s it going to take for her to understand that her millions of fans don\u0027t really care about her little husband?Comments (52)Ahmed Shihab-EldinEmmy-Nominated Producer/Host, @HuffPostLiveTen years after the failed Iraq war, secret legal memos reveal that President Obama is using the same fear-mongering around \"imminent threats\" of evil to justify his drones program as President Bush did to justify invading Iraq under his pre-emptive doctrine.Comments (122)Obery M. Hendricks, Jr., Ph.D.Author of The Universe Bends Toward Justice: the Bible, the Church and the Body Politic (Orbis, 2010)Most Americans who oppose gay rights and same-sex marriage justify their opposition by turning to the Bible. But does the Bible really oppose homosexuality? You\u0027d be surprised.Comments (345)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostAll the talk about \"leaning in\" at work, inevitably leads to the subject of leaning in at home. You can\u0027t be equal at the office unless you are equal outside of it.  Comments (243)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgOn Friday I was one of three witnesses to testify before a House committee hearing on whether the cost of health insurance will be higher or lower for people who cannot obtain it through their employer when important provisions of the Affordable Care Act go into effect in a few months.CommentsYuval Elizur and Lawrence MalkinBenjamin Netanyahu bet on the support of the religious bloc in the January elections, and his party lost heavily. When President Obama arrives in Israel on Wednesday he will be greeted by a prime minister who has been dethroned as king of Israel and is vulnerable to political pressures.Comments (11)Dan FroomkinContributing editor, Nieman ReportsIn her new book, Susan Crawford compellingly and disturbingly makes it clear that we are well on our way to a very disturbing future of expensive, substandard and unequal Internet access -- with Comcast boldly leading the charge.Comments (21)Terry MollnerFounder and board member, Calvert FoundationCan the world\u0027s most powerful CEOs, beholden as they are to tradition, the profit demands of shareholders and Wall Street financial analysts, embrace the concept of the common good and lead their companies in a more people and earth-friendly way?CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerNaturally I turn to technology to help me out. Modern technology is awesome, but not enough. Here is my current, highly optimized, guide to personal productivity using a combination of technology, common sense, and ideas stolen (with love) from various experts and scientific studies.Comments (15)John TirmanExecutive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesThe Iraq War raises many questions still, 10 years after those first bombs sought out Saddam Hussein. Most of the coverage will focus on the decisions leading to the war, the blend of lies and arrogance in the Bush administration. What we won\u0027t hear much about is what happened to Iraqis.Comments (177)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureA Cyprus-like incursion on people\u0027s savings seems unlikely here.  But if the past several years have taught us anything, it\u0027s to \"never say never.\"Comments (12)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportLast year, for the first time ever, two No. 2 seeds, Duke and Missouri), lost in the first round. It\u0027s never easy to pick a massive upset like that, but you should be prepared as you\u0027re filling out that bracket. Here is a look at six high seeds on upset alert during the first weekend.CommentsAmb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserThe president will go to great lengths to reassure Israelis of his unyielding support for their security. But, as he reiterates these commitments, Obama will also urge his Israeli audiences to take a long hard look at what a failed peace process means to Israel\u0027s next generations.Comments (17)Domonique FoxworthPresident, NFL Players AssociationKnowing all that we know about the professionalization of college sports, we the fans, boosters and alumni, stand by while young men are exploited. Not only do we endorse this system through our complacency, but some of us also deliberately oppose change.Comments (50)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolBy remaining anonymous until he went on MSNBC\u0027s Ed Show last week, Prouty ensured that the story would be about Romney, not about the motives of the man who made the tape.Comments (19)Cody GossettAOL Ad Sales Director Turned World TravelerAlmost every person we\u0027ve spoken to about our travels has told us that they\u0027re envious and want to do the same thing -- to that I always say, \"You can. Just put a date on your calendar and give your jobs six weeks notice before you leave.\"CommentsCraig KanalleySenior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s not a dramatic new look, but if you spend some time with Pinterest\u0027s latest overhaul, you\u0027ll see it\u0027s easy to find more content you\u0027ll enjoy, quickly. And as a result, you\u0027ll probably spend more time on the social network.CommentsRoger HickeyCo-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureDespite a presidential campaign that revolved a lot on who had the better jobs plan, the political debate in Washington, driven by the party that lost the presidency, is once again dominated by the question of which party has the best plan to cut deficits. But Democrats should not forget that voters still care most about jobs.Comments (72)HuffPost RadioA decade later, Ron Reagan \u0026 Torie Clarke (DOD\u0027s voice on 9/11 and 3/19) debate why we invaded Iraq and lessons learned. Then: Ron Paul/Tea Party warn about Americans dying from drones but not from the eight-fold growth of right-wing militias with AR-17s?CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThe American people don\u0027t serve Paul Ryan. They\u0027re not \"The Help.\" He\u0027s \"The Help.\" And right now, by demanding austerity that Americans already rejected, Paul Ryan is back-talking the boss. It\u0027s insolent, insubordinate and disrespectful.Comments (257)Miles Atkinson, 2013.18.03Molly Hahn, 2013.18.03Patricia DeGennaro, 2013.18.03Ryan J.
