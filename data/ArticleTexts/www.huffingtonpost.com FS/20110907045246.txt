{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"With a new class of students starting college this month -- replacing a class that just graduated into a historically bad job market -- there\u0027s no better time for another installment of our \"Majoring in Debt\" series, which examines the mountainous student debt college graduates are facing, how it will affect their futures, and what it will mean for the future of America. When I was 16 and living in Greece, I saw a magazine article about Cambridge and was overcome by a desire to study there. And I was lucky enough to get in. In the years after graduating, pretty much every break I got could be traced back to that experience. But, increasingly, graduating from college no longer means putting your education to work for you -- it now means being a virtual indentured servant to your education. Instead of propelling you into the future, more and more it means trapping you in the past.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 9/6/11Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesI want to make an essential yet poorly understood point about spending on jobs programs of the type we expect to hear Thursday night.

Gregory Connolly is an ostensibly grown-up journalist, tasked by USA Today to summarize some \"tips\" from Laing\u0027s book.

Brace yourself for another tiresome, ideological attack on women\u0027s health and rights, in the form, once again, of the Global Gag Rule.Read Post | CommentsPaul Brandeis Raushenbush, 9/6/11Rev.

Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027Maybe ... men just love differently. To jigger the famous line from Sex and The City; it\u0027s not that he\u0027s not into you, it\u0027s just that the expression gets hung up in the netting of a woman\u0027s expectations of expression as proof of existence.Read Post | Comments (402)Noam Chomsky, 9/6/11Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyThat Washington was bent on fulfilling Osama bin Laden\u0027s fervent wishes was evident at once. There is every likelihood that the Jihadi movement, much of it highly critical of bin Laden, could have been split and undermined after 9/11.Read Post | Comments (304)Angela Flournoy, 9/6/11Writer and Contributor to PostBourgie.comA recent conversation about Ebonics got me to thinking about Faulkner and James Baldwin, and the way certain dialects in this country get no respect.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 9/6/11Author, commentator and contributing editor, TheLoop21.comSarah Palin could get in just long enough to serve as a grenade that shakes up the race and then get out early enough to avoid embarrassing herself.

Today it attacked Eric Schneiderman, the New York Attorney General taking a brave stand against a cushy settlement with America\u0027s banks.Read Post | CommentsSusie Bright, 9/6/11www.susiebright.comHow did reading get to be such a faster-pussycat-hurry-up activity? We listen to favorite songs over and over without apology or distraction. They make us feel good, no explanation necessary. But with books, there\u0027s this myth that it takes a \"long time\".Read Post | CommentsSteven Cohen, 9/6/11Executive Director, Columbia University’s Earth InstituteKilling the air rule was bad politics. I guess his consultants hope that Obama can neutralize his opposition by moving in their direction. The only problem is that instead of looking moderate, the president looks unprincipled.Read Post | Comments (54)Raymond J. Learsy, 9/6/11Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption\u0027Most worrisome about a Rick Perry presidency for those of us who don\u0027t live in Texas and are not engaged in the oil business is the prospect of staggeringly higher gasoline prices, and the impact that would have on the nation\u0027s economy.Read Post | Comments (289)Michael Brenner, 9/6/11Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghObama\u0027s betrayal will resonate long after he has become another name on the celebrity speaker circuit. It is a betrayal of far more than the idealists and progressives who put him in the White House. He has unmoored the Democratic Party from its foundations.Read Post | Comments (477)Dennis Merritt Jones, 9/6/11Award-winning author, Keynote speaker, spiritual mentorIf we stop and consider our journey up to this moment, as we look back to the very first day we arrived here, we shall see that we entered into a lifetime of relationships.Read Post | CommentsKelly Moore, 9/6/11Writer (and yoga teacher) with extensive experience in international security and public policyUN personnel must be held accountable for violations of the law and administrative cover-ups of misdeeds.
