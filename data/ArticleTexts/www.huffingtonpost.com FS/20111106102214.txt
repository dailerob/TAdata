{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the New York Post became utterly unhinged over Occupy Wall Street, Grover Norquist ricocheted between being \"the most powerful man in America\" (ask Alan Simpson) and \"some random person in America\" (ask John Boehner), and Kim Kardashian failed to live happily ever after -- or even happily after 72 days. On the GOP campaign trail, Rick Perry tried to explain going all gooey over a bottle of maple syrup, Herman Cain gave a master\u0027s course in how not to handle a sex scandal, and Mitt Romney replaced Lou Gehrig as the luckiest man on the face of the earth. Meanwhile, the Party of No lived down to its name as Senate Republicans obstructed another piece of the president\u0027s jobs bill, blocking $60 billion targeted to patching up America\u0027s crumbling infrastructure -- earning the undying support of gaping potholes, collapsing bridges, and derailed trains all across the country. Andy Rooney would have had a field day mocking that one.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 12/4/11Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupIf only the congressional super committee held its secret deliberations in a booth at the Tune Inn, we would have a deal well before the third pitcher of Natty Boh was served.Read Post | Comments (104)Matt Damon and Gary White, 12/1/11Even today, as solutions are known and available, lack of access to safe water and sanitation continues to claim more lives through disease than any war claims through guns.Read Post | Comments (513)Arianna Huffington, 12/2/11Everyone in Washington now wants to be caught trying to do something about the jobs crisis. But what the country needs are leaders who will do more than just be caught trying. This isn\u0027t just about helping those in need; this is about helping keep our society strong.Read Post | Comments (484)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 12/1/11CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAmerican policymakers, together with their European counterparts, are realizing something that Japan has been experiencing for a while: It is very difficult to manage well an economy hobbled by structural impediments and balance sheet excesses.Read Post | Comments (232)Marlo Thomas, 12/1/11Award-winning actress; Author; ActivistIn case you need reminding from when you were a kid -- kids keep secrets from their parents. But there is one secret, for sure, that has to be brought out into the open... because it\u0027s killing them.Read Post | Comments (327)Dan McDermott, 12/5/11Virginia newspaper publisherAside from the fact that he was classy, smart and a great writer, what really made Andy special to me was that he was one of the last of the people who were part of the beginning of television.Read Post | Comments (12)Bill Moyers, 12/2/11Managing editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyOur politicians are little more than money launderers in the trafficking of power and policy -- fewer than six degrees of separation from the spirit and tactics of Tony Soprano.Read Post | Comments (198)Cristina Page, 12/4/11Author, \u0027How the Pro-Choice Movement Saved America\u0027Justin Bieber serves as an allegory for the way we treat American teens: leading them to temptation, unprotected and unprepared, and expecting more of them than we do of ourselves.Read Post | Comments (243)Van Jones, 12/4/11President, RebuildtheDream.com; Author of NY Times bestseller, \u0027The Green-Collar Economy\u0027Today, tens of thousands of people all over the country will leave the big banks and move their money to community banks and credit unions, where people remember things like customer service and loyalty.Read Post | Comments (759)Tory Burch, 12/1/11CEO/CCO, Tory Burch\"I love you Tory Burch, you closeted bling-loving Indian woman, you.\" This is how I first met comedian, television producer and writer Mindy Kaling.Read Post | CommentsDavid Frum, 12/2/11Editor, FrumForum.comTo put it mildly, poverty alleviation has not been a Republican theme in the current cycle. To some degree, this is an understandable reaction to the disappointments of the Bush presidency. But what is understandable is not necessarily right.Read Post | Comments (439)Dylan Ratigan, 12/4/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027If belief in the integrity of the Supreme Court frays, the Court\u0027s power will fray as well. This is in no one\u0027s interest. We need a system of justice, but a system of justice that serves all of us.Read Post | Comments (564)Dr. Andrew Weil, 12/4/11Founder and director, The Arizona Center for Integrative MedicineThe dramatic rise in depression diagnoses over the last two decades is a great challenge to modern medicine.

His teasing sometimes hit the wrong note, but I think half the time he said things simply because they were too clever to suppress.Read Post | CommentsConrad Black, 12/3/11Historian; Publisher; AuthorAfter the persecution I have endured in the United States, I am now persona non grata there, and it is, as a place to live, patria non grata to me also.
