{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityPity the American people for imagining that they have just elected the new Congress. In a formal way, they of course have. The public did vote. But in a substantive way, it\u0027s not true that they have chosen their government. This was the billionaires\u0027 election, billionaires of both parties. And while the Republican and Democratic Party billionaires have some differences, what unites them is much stronger than what divides them, a few exceptions aside. Indeed, many of the richest individual and corporate donors give to both parties. The much-discussed left-right polarization is not polarization at all. The political system is actually relatively united and working very effectively for the richest of the rich.As Bob Herbert tells us, we have lost our way. Our elected officials dream no big dreams. They have little or no concept of major public works programs to rebuild our nation\u0027s infrastructure, which would put millions of people to work and invigorate our economy.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The president will be invited to secure his \"legacy\" with big reforms, while being warned not to spoil the broth with action on immigration or clean energy. This kind of bipartisan cooperation will make us long for obstruction.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureCritics revile Rand for defending selfishness as a virtue -- but a less altruistic, more self-centric, more rational approach to dating is precisely what women need to date with less drama, less resentment, less heartache.Malibu based writer, former Cato Institute policy director and former speechwriter for President H.W. BushThere is a somber topic that sales people know too well. When a client comes in distraught and frustrated because they have to make a purchase that has no buyer\u0027s joy and often very little thought... the need to buy an outfit for a funeral.Fashion MarketingAlthough Republicans will now control 53 percent of the seats in the Senate, these Republican senators actually represent only 46 percent of the American people. It\u0027s a strange kind of landslide, indeed.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWe have seen the rise of a community known as the disgruntled commenter, the one who picks fights, hates the writing, never has anything nice (or productive) to say. But that\u0027s the price we pay and, well, I\u0027ve come to realize it\u0027s a relatively small one.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarDemocratic strategists have been segmenting the electorate and seeking individual self-interest-based issues in each electoral block. The strategists also keep suggesting a move to the right. This has left no room for the Democrats to have an overriding authentic moral identity that Americans can recognize.Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics and Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!Republicans seem to have convinced the average American that what is good for billionaires, oil and gas companies, pharmaceutical companies, health insurance companies, banks, chemical companies and defense contractors is good for them.AuthorSupporters of Tennessee\u0027s Amendment 1 that just passed with 53% of the vote now plan to roll out several regulations to restrict access to abortion. Here is the underlying assumption and net affect behind each of the three new regulations.Author, Every Third Woman in America: How Legal Abortion Transformed Our Nation;former Chief of the Abortion Surveillance Branch at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)He was unique to this world, not because of his success in advertising, although some may argue that. But because he was a gentle soul, who found himself, at a very young age, searching for the meaning of man.Actress and producerRegardless of one\u0027s party, serious citizens concerned for our country\u0027s future should be thinking seriously about where our politics are headed, not just left or right but forward or backward.United States Senator (Ret.)At a fundamental level, suspicious activity reporting, as well as the digital and physical infrastructure of networked computer servers and fusion centers built around it, depends on what the government defines as suspicious. As it happens, this turns out to include innocuous, First Amendment-protected behavior.Director, ACLU’s National Security ProjectSenior Writer/Editor - ACLUYour data is telling a story about you. Maybe the story\u0027s a good one: you vote at every election, you pay your bills on time, you do your job well and get to work on time each day. But there are now so many data brokers -- buyers and sellers of data -- that databases may be defaming you without you even knowing it.Author, The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms that Control Money \u0026 Information (Harvard University Press, 2015)We can\u0027t go into the 2016 cycle thinking that Republican arrogance and demographics alone will save us. We have to have a strategy that simultaneously fires up our base and appeals to middle- and working-class swing voters.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThough Ronald Reagan\u0027s call to \"tear down this wall\" has come to be iconic of his role in the last days of the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was widely seen as the leader primarily responsible for the change.Expert in American politics, Executive Director of the Roper Center, and a Professor of Political Science at the University of ConnecticutIt\u0027s clearer than ever: If Democrats don\u0027t offer bold solutions to some fundamental economic issues (we\u0027ll offer eight of them, but there are more) then the implications for their party -- and for the country -- are profound, and dire.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourFew issues require as urgent attention as America\u0027s ISIS strategy. America\u0027s multi-year strategy against ISIS lies on the cusp of collapse. The Obama Administration needs to understand that its train-and-equip program is simply too piecemeal and too slow. To remain viable, moderate Syrian rebels need weapons now.Senior political adviser and government relations director, Syrian American Council in WashingtonMitch McConnell has done his share of bipartisan deals in the Senate, but almost always on his own terms and almost always after he helped create the crisis that he then takes credit for ending.Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupEveryone has witnessed or experienced discordant expressions -- crying at a wedding, growling at the sight of a newborn baby, screaming in the presence of a teen idol. Are these inappropriate emotional expressions simply embarrassing aberrations? What psychological purpose could they serve?Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027What may seem like a surprisingly fast turn toward legalization has actually been a long, slow movement against pot\u0027s prohibition -- one that began in the early 1960s, peaked in the late \u002770s, and then failed to secure a single major victory again until the late \u002790s.Author, \u0027Head Shops and Whole Foods: Radical Retail of the 1960s and \u002770s\u0027; co-director, Media and the Movement projectLearning how to code is seen today as key to building a successful life. Barack Obama, Michael Bloomberg, and even Enrique Iglesias have all urged people to study coding.Cofounder of Bubble, Math+CS+MBA with a lot of bite. Exploring the economic limits of technology.I don\u0027t think we can be a people-pleaser or an approval-addict AND be brave with our lives. Perhaps that\u0027s why fearlessness or bravery starts with our identity first, it\u0027s the deep well from which we draw living water, enough for today.Author of Jesus FeministNarrowing it down to a select few is no easy task. However, regardless of the number, I do have a library of required reading for CEOs. Here are my top seven must read books for CEOs.CEO, Clarity GroupTwo key differences emerge when comparing the US and democracies that are leading in female representation. The first is that many countries have implemented gender quotas, a mechanism that is unconstitutional in the US. The second is that countries using proportional representation systems often have higher female representation.Statistician and health economist for the United Nations; Teacher, Columbia UniversityToo many Democrats did not make a clear and convincing case about the consequences of policies pushed by far-right activists and promoted by Republican elected officials. And that allowed the debate to become a referendum on voters\u0027 feelings about Barack Obama.President, People For the American WayWe recognize, for example, Internet access metered by the minute or restricted to a single website is a bad deal. Even from a business perspective, \u002790s style portals are regarded as penny wise and pound foolish. Nonetheless, it is this antiquated reasoning which is constraining Africa\u0027s burgeoning Internet.Academy Award Nominated ActorCorkscrews have a nasty habit of playing hide and seek on the days you need a glass of wine the most.Showing you what you need to see todayI\u0027m reminded of the old saw about being careful about what you ask for, because you might get it. If these far-right radicals are half as good at governing as they\u0027ve been at heckling from the sidelines, they\u0027ll be political superstars.Liberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"Nearly 80% of the country is not divided, but actually united on many issues. So why are we always led to believe otherwise? How does this affect us personally and as a nation? And what are we to do about correcting this grand illusion?Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.Dear friend, You might be curious to know what my disease consists of. You\u0027re surely detached enough to listen to me calmly. I\u0027ve met very few people who were able to listen to me. Maybe none. But you\u0027re here, with a fresh mind and a calm eye.EntrepreneurGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
