{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The No vote to austerity by a margin of 62 to 38 is a stunning vindication of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s tactical gamble and political savvy. But the Greek crisis has demonstrated how deeply divided are the leaders of the E.U. and its most powerful member nations. The one potential bright spot is the partly dissident role of the IMF as abetted by the Obama administration. The best hope is that the IMF -- nominally part of the “troika” of Greece’s creditors but more realistic than the Germans and the European Commission -- will break more openly with the austerity camp. The stakes, however, are larger than Greece, as Europe enters its eighth year of stagnation. Though politicians like Scheuble have been all too ready to jettison Greece to purify fiscally austere Europe, it’s increasingly clear that the E.U. needs to change course -- not just to save Greece but to save itself.The Greek crisis has made it painfully clear that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) needs a change at the top -- and that the U.S. must use its privileged position as the IMF\u0027s biggest contributor to insist on it.Associate Professor of Law, Yale Law SchoolAs the world powers negotiate with Iran, they should constantly remind themselves that the Iranian government has not come to the negotiating table to discuss the terms of its surrender. Likewise, Iranian negotiators must realize that Iran\u0027s nuclear program is seen at a threat by major powers.Research Associate at Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland (CISSM)With the reauthorization of the absurd and dysfunctional NCLB, we have a chance to once again let teachers teach and let students learn. We have a chance to ignite their imaginations, encourage them to reach their full potential, and expand their world view beyond filling in bubble tests with a #2 pencil.President, National Education AssociationThe outcome of this Greek drama is not up to the Greeks anymore. It now depends on how European leaders will react. Whether they will view the referendum result as an opportunity for a big deal or a chance to rid themselves of the Greek issue, putting all the blame on the Greeks, remains to be seen.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceThe attitude that Lyall adopts toward Senator Sanders is, instead, mildly and cheerfully disparaging -- affectionate, but at the proper distance of condescension; ironically agreeable, as you are allowed to be in dealing with a second cousin or an eccentric uncle who is a bit of a blowhard. Hers is not the first such article to appear on Sanders in the Times.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityPresident Obama has repeatedly stated that he prefers no deal to a bad deal. Fortunately, the negotiators are on the right track to resolve the Iranian nuclear crisis peacefully, allowing all sides to walk away knowing that what they\u0027re getting is better than they\u0027re giving up.Missouri State RepresentativeRecently, the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce released some findings about what new graduates could expect to earn. The results are interesting and may well speak to where the workforce will head if left to market forces.Director of the Edvance FoundationTrue patriotism isn\u0027t simply about waving the American flag. And it\u0027s not mostly about securing our borders from outsiders. It\u0027s about coming together for the common good.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The referendum, before being conducted, unfortunately released the darkest aspects and features of Greek political socialization. It reinstated divisive reasoning in the public sphere, divided society into two camps with no diffusion and without any room for common ground.Blogger, radio producerThe book is instructive and disturbing on many levels. First and foremost, I was struck by the arrogance and the sense of impunity with which Ally was written. No one who criticizes Israel is spared from Oren\u0027s venomous pen. Two targets receive special attention: President Obama and liberal American Jews.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027We need a new declaration of independence. FDR took a stab at this, with his \"Four Freedoms.\" That\u0027s a good start. But now, eight decades later, we need to declare our independence from other forms of oppression.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictThis Shark Week 2015 -- and on the 40th anniversary of Jaws -- let us reflect upon our growing appreciation for (and willingness to protect) these vulnerable species. Let us then dramatically scale our commitment to reverse the decline of these magnificent species on a global scale.Executive Director, Global Marine Program, Wildlife Conservation SocietySome territorial claims are easy. Often, however, history disdains simplicity. In this case, there is a complex mix of control, historical practice, international law and treaty. In the view of most observers, Beijing\u0027s claims are extravagant. Yet, they are not unprecedented.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIt wasn\u0027t until my freshman year of college that I fully accepted that girls just weren\u0027t for me and that there was nothing I could do about it. I was a closeted 18-year-old in the midst of pledging the biggest \"bro\" fraternity on campus. Now what?Serial entrepreneur in a world of uncommon perspectives.I\u0027m not naive. I know that Sanders is a seasoned politician, that he didn\u0027t get where he is by being an amateur bumpkin. His ideas are going to have to be put forth and examined. I know he\u0027s not Superman or a knight on a white steed. But I also know Vermont, and I know slickness will only get you so far there.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comThe Supreme Court\u0027s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges establishing nationwide marriage equality will likely go down in history as one of the Court\u0027s great landmark rulings. The tone of the majority opinion is strikingly vivid, emotionally intelligent, and personal.Legal Director, Marriage Equality USAMedia Director, Marriage Equality USAFriendships should strengthen our peace of mind and contribute to our inner harmony. Consider taking these six steps the next time you sense toxicity brewing within a relationship and rediscover the joys of truly positive energy.Alexandra Harra is a certified life coach, professional writer, and cover model. Her upcoming book, The Karma Queens\u0027 Guide to Relationships, is set for release by Penguin Books in May, 2015.As a former D.C. resident who is now living fully represented in California, I am surprised by the indifference that exists to the plight of Washington\u0027s 658,893 residents who are heavily taxes yet have no voting representation in Congress. It seems maybe we have become too comfortable with this denial of liberty.Host, Cyber Law and Business Report; political columnist; internet lawyerWhat makes smarter than average people less smart about their health? We are living longer but not healthier, despite all the attention paid to health in the media. What we need is more funding for food research and better labeling, not less. More responsible journalistic reporting, not more sensational pronouncements.Health policy consultantMy grandmother went into hospice the day the Supreme Court heard arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges. She died the next day, surrounded by people she loved. In her mind, we were married in 2004, and all the civil rights victories that followed didn\u0027t seem to phase her. But I can\u0027t help thinking about the grandmothers in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.Executive Director, IMPACT BostonIs there really merit to the claims that cost makes eating clean unattainable for budget-minded people? And how can you reap the benefits if you\u0027re not willing to fork over huge amounts of cash?Health and fitness articles to help you live a healthier, happier and more active lifestyle. Here\u0027s to a better you, for life!One number: 22. That\u0027s all it took to transform Ellen Goosenberg Kent from a filmmaker to a woman on a mission. \"When I heard that 22 veterans are killing themselves every day, I thought: This is outrageous. That\u0027s almost one every hour. I had to do something,\" she said.Investigative Reporter, The NationAs a guiding principle, whatever happens during your meditation session is okay. Meet your experience with kindness and gratitude, and your meditation session will be well worth it, no matter what happens.CEO and Founder of Life Coach SpotterDuring 27 years of marriage, we had long passed the point of taking each other for granted. It didn\u0027t help that we worked opposite schedules for so many years -- becoming almost alternating parents. In the past year, we\u0027ve made a conscious effort to change that focus.AuthorAs in 1940, despite the hard road mandated by their decision, the Greek people have placed national honor and dignity on a higher plane than the only other alternative on offer: an ultimatum based on collective indignity and national impoverishment .Founder, GlobalEconomicCrisis.comI know it\u0027s your \"job\" but it\u0027s also your worse fear. No one can ever have enough training to prepare you for what this moment will actually feel like, but because of you, this little boy is home playing with his family today.Professional Photographer, Creative Business Coach, Writer, Traveler, life lover, TBI Survivor, and mommy to a rescue YorkieIt\u0027s not over. Not by a long shot. Not when conservatives are already looking for ways to chip away at marriage equality the way they whittled down reproductive rights to nothing in many states.Director of Advocacy, SPARTAThe truth is that, when you\u0027re dealing with a hospital, you have to be vigilant and firm -- right from the very beginning. As crazy as it sounds, you cannot assume that the hospital knows what it\u0027s doing or has your parent\u0027s best interests at heart.National aging expert and founder of www.daughterhood.org; helping women get smart about their aging parents.Funfetti sugar cookie bars are one of those desserts that make their appearance over and over again in my kitchen.
