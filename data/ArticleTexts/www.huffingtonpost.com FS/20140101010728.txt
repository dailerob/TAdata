{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Donna Rockwell, PsyDLicensed clinical psychologist, specialist in celebrity mental health, leading mindfulness meditation teacher, and activist in contemporary humanistic psychologyWe do the same thing every year. New Year\u0027s Eve comes and goes, and our New Year\u0027s resolutions, promised so fiercely at the stroke of midnight, are dismissed shortly thereafter, fading away over time, like friends who\u0027ve moved to another city. It is the dirty not-so-little secret of New Year\u0027s resolutions: They are very rarely kept. In fact, resolutions usually made in desperation (I\u0027ve got to lose weight this year!) become another excuse for guilt and self-denigration, another opportunity to feel like a failure. How can resolutions be a point of positive self-growth, instead, where we make them, and keep them, and benefit from their healing and restorative powers?CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostToday we can ask ourselves the ultimate question: To what will we devote our life in this very short span of time that we have in this world? What will captivate us, be the focus of our life\u0027s energy, be what we care most about in the world. In short -- what will we worship?Comments (26)Tessa GouldDirector, HuffPost Partner StudioThe banter around native advertising, and more specifically native content publishing, reached fever pitch this year. Every man and his dog had a view on how it should be defined, measured, labeled, scaled and priced. And while the the jury may still be out on a number of these issues, one thing we do know here at HuffPost Partner Studio is bloody good native content when we see it.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageDespite do-nothing congressional Republicans, we ARE making progress around the country because Americans are organizing and mobilizing. Together we can make 2014 the year we turn the tide on economic inequality.Comments (69)Jillian LaurenAuthor and bloggerI resent my body and its annoying needs, its troublesome memories and emotions, its alarming register of the passing years. But I have learned time and time again that it is my only way back to feeling grounded and present in the world.CommentsDavid RockDirector, NeuroLeadership InstituteIn 2013, we continued to push the boundaries of what we know about ourselves; going boldly into questions no researcher has gone before. Like, what should we do when we need a little lift -- take a run, have a coffee, or grab a beer?CommentsJennifer BenderyWhen I really think about 2013, I realize I spent most of the year looking for her. We once had a pact: If one of us died, you\u0027d have to send the other one a sign that you were okay, that you weren\u0027t reeeeeally gone but just in a different place.Comments (50)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe Intelligence Community needs to win back the trust of the American people. It can do that, not by being defensive, but by acknowledging that periodic review, reexamination and recalibration are healthy and constructive in a self-governing society, and by bending over backwards to embrace reforms that will help restore the public\u0027s trust.CommentsBetsy Brown BraunChild development and behavior specialist, author, wife, mom, granny and friendLet\u0027s talk about resolving to make some changes in your parenting -- small adjustments that you can do and keep up, that will make a big difference in your life with your child.CommentsMatthew HutsonScience writer; author, \u0027The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking\u0027The running joke about New Year\u0027s resolutions is that they don\u0027t outlast the hangover. But if you\u0027re going to make a resolution to improve yourself, New Year\u0027s Eve is a good time to do it. Recent research helps explains why we pick this date for personal renovation.CommentsClaire FallonManaging Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMy real resolution, however, involves a different kind of muscle -- one that\u0027s been atrophying in recent years. Yes, it\u0027s my brain, which needs to be strengthened with a healthy reading regimen.CommentsDevon CornealMother, writer, lawyerHe\u0027s so innocent and I\u0027m so jaded and I want to preserve this curiosity and openness forever, but I can\u0027t. He thinks I know the answers.CommentsMark RadcliffeWriter and singer/songwriterDear Ladies Who Are On The Fence About Whether Or Not to Dump The Guy Who\u0027s Taking You For Granted: Here\u0027s what you should be hearing from the guy who\u0027s worthy of your time.Comments (20)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Last week former New York Times editor Bill Keller had a column that distinguished the \"left-left\" and the center-left. However, what\u0027s more important than the labeling is the main line of distinction Keller tries to draw.Comments (33)Debbi DickinsonEntrepreneurWhat I realized is that my resolutions were focused more around what I should NOT be doing versus who I SHOULD strive to be. I usually found that by the second or third week of January, I had reverted back to my old habits and my resolutions were forgotten or at least ignored.CommentsGeorge HalvorsonFormer Chairman and CEO, Kaiser PermanenteThirty minutes a day of reading can determine whether or not a child can read or not read -- and that interaction can determine whether a child will stay in school or not stay in school.CommentsAmy ChanRelationship \u0026 lifestyle columnist, founder of www.JustMyType.caThis year, instead of creating a new set of goals and resolutions, I\u0027ve decided to create a contract. This is a contract with myself, on the everyday behaviors and perspectives I can incorporate so I can grow -- so that I can be the best version of \"me,\" that I can be.Comments (30)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterResolutions, born of a \"ready or not, let\u0027s go\" mentality, invite failure. So reinvent your resolutions and make them more likely to succeed. Resolve to get ready, and go only when you are.CommentsJeffrey BuchananSenior Domestic Policy Advisor, Oxfam AmericaMuch ink is spilt in end-of-year recaps this time of year, but the most compelling national analysis so far came from Joan Walsh of Salon. She proclaimed 2013 as the year \"Americans discovered the crisis of the working poor.\" But unfortunately Congress still hasn\u0027t discovered it.CommentsJacob GoldING retirement coach and authorMany people shy away from New Year\u0027s resolutions, but setting concrete goals for 2014 can be the start of making some truly positive changes in your life.CommentsRachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityI really don\u0027t mean for this to be a guilt trip, but more of a swift kick in the rear to get you moving! I learned a very hard lesson at a young age and hindsight truly is 20/20.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorYears ago books mattered more in provoking change. It is up to readers today not to be overwhelmed by information overload, to be selective and make books matter again.CommentsJennifer BallMom, writer, teacher, lover of dirty martinis and yoga pantsHere are the things you need to stop saying if you are over the age of 30. Or if you have a mortgage, or a job that comes with benefits. Or if you have teens. Especially, if you have teens.Comments (716)Nate HoughtelingPartner and Executive Producer at Portal AAs we bask in the ubiquity of \"The Fox,\" \"Wrecking Ball,\" and \"The Harlem Shake,\" it\u0027s important to remember that there\u0027s so much more that happened on YouTube this year outside of the top 10.CommentsSven CarlssonSwedish freelance journalist; Graduate student, Columbia School of JournalismIf there were a time for New York to shift progressive, this would be it. The city\u0027s demographics favor liberal candidates, and the gap between rich and poor is so significant that running on a platform to fight it will get you 73 percent of the vote.CommentsGary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)Safe landings are not news; crashes are news. But we must not be left without hope. For many of us, however, what makes life worthwhile is to focus on safe landings and those who make a difference every day, every year.CommentsBrian LeiterKarl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence and Director of the Center for Law, Philosophy and Human Values at the University of ChicagoThe cyber-mob counsels against earning a J.D. without offering any other guidance; yet the best evidence demonstrates that a J.D. is a good financial investment for the vast majority over the long term.CommentsJack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington PostIt hasn\u0027t been hard to see that morning news is getting gayer and gayer. But the confirmation by Robin Roberts of the widely assumed -- but rarely discussed -- fact that she is a lesbian in a long-term relationship is on another level entirely.Comments (76)Steven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolAmericans aren\u0027t looking forward to their new careers as \"micro-entrepreneurs.\" Being a \"micro-entrepreneur\" in this brave new world seems instead just a euphemism for being an employee, except with reduced compensation, job security, benefits and protections.Comments (278)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (17)Rachel Held EvansBlogger, speaker, authorEating shellfish is an abomination, a bare head is a disgrace, gossips will not inherit the kingdom of God, careless words are punishable by hell, guys who leer at women should gouge out their eyes.Comments (258)Angie HicksFounder and Chief Marketing Officer, Angie\u0027s ListAs we find time to bake, prep for guests or (hopefully) relax in front of the fire or TV, many of us experience a nagging sense that something\u0027s been left undone. Call it \"house angst.\"CommentsChristine Pelosi, 2013.31.12Karen Dalton-Beninato, 2013.31.12Rajesh Setty, 2013.31.12Matt Sledge, 2013.31.12Dr. Reese Halter, 2013.31.12Yetta Kurland, 2013.31.12Crystal Duan, 2013.31.12Dan Shapiro, 2013.31.12John Thatamanil, 2013.31.12Sue Shanahan, 2013.31.12Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"2013: SEE YA!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
