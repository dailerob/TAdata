{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From fedgrants.govPresident Bush was positively giddy during his Rose Garden appearance this morning. After spinning the upbeat economic numbers for the press, the president headed off, ignoring a shouted question about Iraq. And that\u0027s the bottom line for the White House: They might be able to spin the new economic numbers, but they can\u0027t spin the war -- including the news this morning that 10 Marines on foot patrol were killed by a roadside bomb near Fallujah. That\u0027s why now, more than ever, the Democrats need to make 2006 a referendum on the war. Fortunately, they already have a template for success: follow Jack Murtha.READ POST | comments (113)12.03.2005 Tom HaydenWill Americans be manipulated into believing that politicians have gotten the message and are planning to withdraw from Iraq?READ POST | comments (26)12.03.2005 Harry ShearerA new document dump details the disagreement between the Gov and the Pres over the deployment of Guard troops during the early days of the disaster.READ POST | comments (11)12.03.2005 Craig CrawfordFormer Sen.
