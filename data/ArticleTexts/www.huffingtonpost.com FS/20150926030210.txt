{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Secretary-General, United NationsIn a world beset by so many challenges, problems and disputes, it is a sign of hope that more than 150 world leaders will gather this week at the United Nations to adopt a new vision for the future well-being of all humankind. They are coming to New York because they understand the need to steer the world onto a safer, more equitable and more sustainable trajectory. At the heart of the new agenda are the Sustainable Development Goals: 17 bold yet achievable goals that aim to end poverty, fight inequality, tackle climate change and build peaceful societies by the year 2030.We in the West aren\u0027t as freed up as we should be, but we also aren\u0027t as busy as we\u0027re constantly told.Executive Blog Editor, Huffington Post Media GroupPope Francis speaks out faithfully and forcefully against poverty and has been called \"the pope of the poor.\" But on his first visit to the United States there was demoralizing news about poverty, especially child poverty, in our nation -- the world\u0027s largest economy.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt is a universal message -- one that speaks to the challenges climate change is having on society and the environment and the role of individuals, civil society and institutions to address them.CEO, UnileverChairman of the Board and CEO of the Kellogg CompanyIt is un-American and outrageous that special laws can deny us our day in court simply because we were victimized by the gun industry. Our lawsuit was not frivolous. Our Jessi was shot multiple times with high-velocity, armor-piercing bullets that were designed by our military to inflict maximum damage on enemy combatants.Parents of Aurora victim Jessica GhawiWith Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, on his way out, Republicans in Congress must replace him with a member who understands the job of the Speaker: to unite rather than divide Americans. The nation\u0027s survival may well depend on finding such a person.Author, Henry Clay: America\u0027s Greatest StatesmanPresidents Xi Jinping and Barack Obama announced new and strengthened actions by both countries domestically and working together as part of a joint presidential statement on climate change. These commitments provide substantial new financing for developing countries to build low-carbon and climate resilient economies.Senior Attorney and Asia Director, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)Please don\u0027t mistake me for a Boehner-defender, but name one other Republican who at least projects a modicum of maturity and discipline. Who, feebly and ineptly, at least tries to act like an adult in a room full of rubes.International High School AdministratorAll Republicans candidates, even those not named Trump, promise to make America great again. That implies, of course, that America is in decline now. That narrative of decline is an historical argument: We were great once, but we aren\u0027t any more.Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioLosing my two boys at such a young age was devastating, and in our journey for answers we discovered that there was very limited understanding on cardiomyopathy in children and no support services for families affected by the disease. With this realization, my husband and I knew something had to be done to address the unmet needs of the disease.Lisa Yue, founding Executive Director of the Children’s Cardiomyopathy Foundation (CCF)The Iran agreement does not offer an indefinite respite. When its restrictions on Iran\u0027s capacity to enrich lapse, concern could revive. This long-term problem cannot be solved through coercion or the use of force. It can only be solved by influencing Iran\u0027s nuclear decision-making and creating incentives for nuclear prudence.Partner in the Ambassador Partnership, Geneva Centre for Security PolicyAlmost 50 percent of women today are childless. Though we don\u0027t know their individual reasons, it\u0027s easy to understand how the pressures of the modern world and the many options available for women to fulfill their creativity, other than parenthood, may very well be affecting these numbers.Human Behavior, Parenting, and Education Expert, Speaker, Author. Ph.D., Ed.D., M.Ed.The Club de Madrid welcomes the effort made by UN Members to prioritize inclusion, giving it much more relevance than in the previous Millennium Development Goals. We, nevertheless, continue to note the absence of a specific and direct reference in support of representative democracy.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateIn these times, many of us are asking how we can support our communities and where we can find sources of positive change. Let me offer an unusual but effective way to bring hope and opportunity to our underserved communities: Chess.First African-American Chess GrandmasterToday, more than two million people are behind bars. Few of us stop to consider the human impacts of incarceration or what it means to be separated from a parent, sibling and social settings you\u0027ve known your entire life.Director of Strategic Partnerships, Drug Policy AllianceBarring federal funding for Planned Parenthood, as some in Congress favor, would have a devastating impact on women\u0027s access to health care services through Medicaid -- especially family planning services -- and put many women\u0027s health at risk.Vice President for Health Policy, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWhen I see images on my screen of Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe, I can\u0027t help but think of all the individuals in Syria with disabilities who can\u0027t swim, run, and jump on crowded trains to escape the horrors they\u0027ve seen.Writer, Better World Advocate, \u0026 Assistant Professor at Sultan Qaboos University in the Sultanate of OmanGOP presidential hopeful Jeb Bush knew exactly what he was doing when he insulted African-American voters by alleging that the Democrats buy their votes with \"free stuff.\" In fact, it was no accident that he hurled his slur at Democrats at a campaign stop in South Carolina.Author and political analystIt was touching to see politicians including House Speaker John Boehner shed tears listening to the Pope\u0027s sermon. But it\u0027s unlikely the Pontiff\u0027s stirring words will be taken to heart by the Speaker and his fellow narrow-minded conservatives, who for years have hid under the cloak of God in perpetrating a self-serving, elitist and decidedly unchristian-like extremist political agenda.Political and Pop Culture AnalystThe outcome illustrates one of the fundamental flaws with the death penalty -- it\u0027s applied arbitrarily. Prosecutors like to say that death penalty is reserved for the \"worst of the worst,\" but the reality is often very different.Executive Director, Amnesty International USAWouldn\u0027t it be great if there were some entity that was more powerful than these corporations, whose purpose is to protect us, reign these corporations in, make and enforce rules, prosecute offenders and put a stop to this stuff?Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureHillary, with her brand-name, overwhelming support of the Democratic Party, and unrivaled ability to raise enormous amounts of cash, appears unbeatable. But Sanders\u0027s campaign cannot be understood according to the usual parameters of U.S. presidential elections. His campaign is far too revolutionary.Political analystWhile the president, despite being nearly 25 years younger, has now begun his downward trajectory, striving for a turnaround that might brighten his sunset, the elderly pontiff continues his masterly rise, armed with a Jesuit shrewdness that keeps him from making mistakes.Reporter, HuffPost ItalyWhether you believe it or not, your decision to own and share your truth has already inspired someone else to do the same. Like yourself, I was raised in a black household, in a black neighborhood, and attended a black church. Like yourself, my experience at my HBCU was bittersweet.Masters of Public Policy candidate at Pepperdine University. HBCU Alumnus and Human Rights Advocate.When I was six years old, I gave my first blowjob. When I was fifteen, I was groped on a bus. At eighteen, I was told that sexism doesn\u0027t exist in modern society. I was told that harassment couldn\u0027t be as bad as us women make it out to be. I am now nineteen years old. I am now tired.WriterAutism isn\u0027t all about the six-year-old who can play Piano Man better than Billy Joel. Autism can be hard. Autism can be sad. Autism can be messy. Autism can be violent. Autism can be isolating.Engagement Specialist, trainer, advocate, parentWhat is truly needed likely cannot be fixed with just a few minor tweaks, but will require a fundamental re-think on what constitutes a successful Hajj.Global Law and Development Fellow, Tetra Tech DPK/Ba DistritoThose looking for a fun, well-illustrated comic with an exciting plot, can follow Marvel\u0027s new Black family of super-heroes on their quest to keep the family together, reclaim the Infinity Stones, and of course, save the galaxy.The premiere online magazine destination for African-American cultural insight, news and perspective.The Papal shout-out will certainly renew interest in Dorothy Day\u0027s life and legacy. By embracing Day, the Pope rankled conservatives within and outside the Catholic Church. How ironic, then, that Francis\u0027 carefully-chosen words may soon elevate the radical Day to a place among America\u0027s saints.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWe mistake the loss of complete dominance for the loss of liberty. We mistake attempts to create parity with minority dominance. There is a system in place that\u0027s killing all of us, some at a higher rate than others.Dismantling racism from the inside outAt the formal welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn at the White House, a very traditional template was transformed by the \"Vicar of Christ,\" whose presence turned everyone\u0027s language to one reference after another to those Christ called \"the least of these\" in the 25th chapter of Matthew.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
