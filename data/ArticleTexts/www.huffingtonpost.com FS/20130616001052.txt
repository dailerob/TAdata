{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThe themes and ideas that make up what we call The Third Metric -- redefining success beyond money and power to include things like well-being, wisdom, wonder, and giving back -- are resonating at every social and economic level, as more and more people are realizing the need for a more humane and sustainable way of doing business. Here at HuffPost, we have started the conversation that will help people change habits and change lives. We know we all agree on the broad issues, but knowing something intellectually is different than embracing it emotionally -- and, most importantly, acting on that knowledge. So, to give those of you who weren\u0027t at our Third Metric conference last week a taste of what was being said by some of the women and men who are already redefining success, I wanted to share a collection of some of my favorite quotes.Comments (50)Theo JansenArtistIn my talk, I mentioned that the Strandbeest would develop a digital brain. Let me tell you about the evolutionary development of Strandbeest after 2007.Comments (73)John CusackMakes films; Board member, Freedom of the Press FoundationThe Snowden Principle, and that fire that inspired him to take unimaginable risks, is fundamentally about fostering an informed and engaged public. The Constitution embraces that idea.Comments (1,730)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere was barely one moment in my life that I can remember when my father was unrecognizable. Whenever we were out together as a family, people would approach him and ask for his autograph or to shake his hand. We accepted it as the way it was, and we were proud that so many people liked our dad.CommentsPatton OswaltComedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesThere is a collective consciousness that can detect the presence (and approach) of something good or bad, in society or the world, before any hard “evidence” exists. It’s happening now with the concept of “rape culture.” Which, by the way, isn’t a concept. It’s a reality.Comments (67)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe first step towards getting a boss to loosen her grip is to remove any possibility from her mind that she needs to be that way. Get to work on time. Meet deadlines. Be productive. Make clients happy.Comments (13)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI believe the iron triangle applies to almost every human endeavor. From throwing a party to keeping a marriage alive for 28 years, no plan survives it\u0027s first encounter with reality. The only real question is which corner of the iron triangle am I going to compromise on?CommentsSusan SobbottPresident, American Express OpenPeople everywhere struggle to find work-life balance. A better approach, in my mind, is to pursue work-life integration.Comments (18)Susie EssmanActress, Curb Your EnthusiasmMy husband doesn\u0027t hate Mad Men. He likes it a lot. Not as much as I do because my like borders on obsession and fixation. But he likes it. What my husband hates, is me, after I watch Mad Men.Comments (92)Chen Guangcheng and Edward McMillan-ScottThe growing preoccupation with trade threatens to sideline the wider issue of how best to promote human rights and democratic reform in China, a country whose political future is set to determine the course of the 21st century.Comments (56)Illah NourbakhshDirector of the CREATE Lab and Head of the Robotics Master\u0027s Program at Carnegie Mellon University\u0027s Robotics InstituteWhether we enter a robot utopia, a robot smog or somewhere in between, we will close the gap between robotically aware and organically alive. Do we create new life forms, as Jansens suggests of his progeny?CommentsAllan GersonChairman of AG International Law in Washington D.C.; Former Counsel to UN Ambassadors Jeane J. Kirkpatrick and General Vernon A. WaltersBeyond humanitarian assistance to refugees in and outside the country and minimal lethal aid to identified \"moderate\" rebel groups, the American public is too tired, shell-shocked, and de-sensitized to by the disheartening experience in Iraq and Afghanistan to militarily intervene for Syria\u0027s civilian victims.Comments (29)Mark R. KennedyProfessor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityResolving the civil war in Syria has the potential to bring more stability to the region. The possibility of a win-win outcome should be a key selling point for Obama as he tries to gather more allies for the cause.Comments (36)Tom CramerLate Boom, Early XWhen I was a kid, I used to love hanging out with my Dad. An inordinate amount of memories involve being in a car. Obviously, we were going somewhere, to do something. While I don\u0027t remember the destinations much, getting there was a blast.CommentsJohn GlaserEditor at Antiwar.comAlas, the administration\u0027s stated reason for deciding to directly arm the Syrian rebels simply lacks credibility. So why the sudden shift in policy? The aim is apparently to keep the Syrian war going, for some key strategic reasons.Comments (170)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027June 30th marks Mohamed Morsi\u0027s first anniversary as President of Egypt. It is also the date set for nationwide demonstrations protesting Morsi\u0027s increasingly authoritarian leadership and the role his Muslim Brotherhood is playing in post-Tahrir Egypt.CommentsSeth TaylorTeacher and WriterWhen kids are loved, they don\u0027t forget it. If we show up for our kids, they\u0027ll show up for us -- especially when we need them most. That\u0027s what my daughter did for me.Comments (17)Michele WeldonAssistant professor of journalism, Northwestern UniversityThere is another story we must tell in this complicated scenario: the positive one where a father who abandons his children does not have the power to annihilate their futures.Comments (96)Allison TateAuthor, mother of fourParenting is a great equalizer. Whether we are suburban moms hoping for a good nap out of our toddlers or renowned actresses or CTOs or television personalities or political big shots, we\u0027re parents. When our children scan a crowd expecting to see our faces, we want to be there. Period.CommentsSeamus McKiernanAssociate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThis 9-year-old cancer survivor is on a mission to take back the term \"bucket list.\" One game of \"messy twister\" at a time. Maya, a third grader from Ohio who is battling a rare form of leukemia, wants to share her \"bucket list for summer 2013\" (below) to inspire others -- healthy or sick, old or young -- to get busy living.CommentsMichael J. KellySous ChefTo say we have rallied together to save my dad would be understating what has actually happened. My dad rallied us together -- and as a result we have become the closest as a family that we have ever been.CommentsBridal GuideFor years, I could not sit through the charming family movie Father of the Bride.

And if it did, would we view it as more or less human depending on which skill it used to refine its opinion of humanity?Comments (46)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostIt seems like what\u0027s happening here is that Miley Cyrus \"loves\" \"hood\" culture, thinks it\u0027s amusing and has no problem co-opting it for singles and/or viral videos, but doesn\u0027t love the idea of herself being seen as part of it. And that\u0027s gross.Comments (170)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThe annual June Father\u0027s day shopping binge is at its zenith.
