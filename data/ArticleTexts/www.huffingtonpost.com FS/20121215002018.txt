{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostMore than a dozen children went to elementary school this morning and were dead before lunch. White House spokesman Jay Carney says today is not the day to talk about gun control. I disagree. That\u0027s all we should talk about today. We are heartbroken, yes. But saying that will fix nothing. It won\u0027t bring anyone back, and it won\u0027t keep this from happening again. And of course we know the parents of Newtown could have been any one of us. That\u0027s important to remember, but it isn\u0027t enough, because the knowing doesn\u0027t change the fact that we could still be next. So we can\u0027t just do as we did after Columbine, after Virginia Tech, after Aurora. We can\u0027t just grieve and hold our children close. We have to demand that our country earn the right to call itself a civilized nation.Read Post | Comments (159)Peter S. Goodman, 12/14/12Executive Business Editor, The Huffington PostIn every country, some people are disturbed, broken-hearted or angry enough to murder. What is special about this country is the extent of the damage that such people are able to inflict when the urge comes.Read Post | Comments (477)Janet Echelman, 12/14/12ArtistThere\u0027s just one thing I\u0027d like to clarify. It sounds like I\u0027m railing against the establishment, and their mistake of rejecting me. But here\u0027s the thing -- I don\u0027t think they were wrong.Read Post | Comments (23)Michael Wolkowitz, 12/14/12Former Chair, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceOne thing I am rather sure of is that we will hear words like \"nothing like this ever happened in this community before.\" They said that after Columbine. They said that after Virginia Tech. They said that after Tuscon. They said that after Aurora. They always say that.Read Post | Comments (18)Susan Stiffelman, 12/14/12Family therapist, Author, Parenting Without Power StrugglesWe are all reeling today in the aftermath of the school shootings in Connecticut. It is impossible to imagine the impact on the families who lost children, those whose children were spared but so profoundly traumatized and the rest of us who bear witness from afar to the unthinkable.Read Post | CommentsCharles Karel Bouley, 12/14/12On-air host, KGO Radio; TV personality, comic, author, actor, writer/producer/director and dog walkerToday, the sad fact is that all we can do is grieve.

Here is a list of my advice on how to cope with trauma involving youth.Read Post | CommentsRobert Walker, 12/14/12President, Population InstituteObserving a never-ending political silence about new gun laws will do nothing to diminish the victims\u0027 sorrow; it will only ensure that others will suffer a similar fate.Read Post | Comments (17)Elamin Abdelmahmoud, 12/14/12WriterA little child who has just experienced a tragedy like this doesn\u0027t need a microphone in his or her face. What we don\u0027t want is the use of little children as a means of getting viewers. Those children need love and care first. The story should always come after.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 12/14/12In this week\u0027s issue, Saki Knafo and Lila Shapiro put the spotlight on Staten Island, telling the story of how Hurricane Sandy collided with one man\u0027s version of the American Dream.

Keegan, 12/14/12President, People for the American WayAnybody who was paying the least bit of attention to this year\u0027s elections would have noticed that two of the things voters find most repugnant about today\u0027s GOP is its blind allegiance to big corporations and its enthusiasm for regulating women\u0027s health.

That requires the courage of heroic sources, including Bradley Manning.Read Post | Comments (161)Jess Coleman, 12/14/12Student, Binghamton UniversityThe constant \"thoughts and prayers\" for the victims are surely comforting, but they are far short of a serious solution. If our leaders truly want to lead, it\u0027s time they put the lives of their voters before the fears of their advisors.Read Post | Comments (26)Ethan Nadelmann, 12/14/12Executive Director, Drug Policy AllianceAnytime the president answers a question about marijuana and federal marijuana policy, as he did in a recent interview with ABC\u0027s Barbara Walters that airs tonight, it makes sense to parse his words.Read Post | Comments (142)Chris Jancelewicz, 12/14/12Lead Entertainment Editor, Huffington Post CanadaThe Hobbit is enjoyable on every level -- from story to cinematography to the performances -- and despite the inherent nerdiness of the franchise, even the non-geeks among us can identify with the triumphs of a small man over big foes.
