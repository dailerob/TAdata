{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityThroughout our history elites threatened by equality, or just by social mobility, have often joined together to block access for groups striving to improve their prospects in life. In the 20th century, policies were enacted to keep immigrants out of universities and to limit the number of Jews who enrolled. And in 2006, the citizens of Michigan passed an amendment to the state constitution banning consideration of race at their universities, undermining opportunity for minorities in the state. This week the Supreme Court voted to uphold the rights of these citizens to forbid race-sensitive admissions policies. Previous Court decisions had allowed schools to consider race among other factors, but this judgment affirms the voters\u0027 right to overrule university policies. Under the guise of democracy and supporting the political process, the Court has allowed States to close off opportunities for those who would benefit from them the most.It\u0027s not 100 percent clear the extent to which Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia meant what it sounded like he meant, but tossing around the word \"revolt\" in the context of a discussion of the U.S. government is never a smart nor rational idea.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowObama campaigned in 2008 as a strong champion of the open Internet, telling an audience that he\u0027d \"take a back seat to no one in my commitment to net neutrality.\" He said that his chair would share his views on safeguarding the open Internet. Now, the president is on his second FCC chair, and neither has proven himself up to the task.Timothy KarrSenior Director of Strategy, Free PressI made eyes at you once on the subway. I saw you across the room at a party. I swiped you right on Tinder. But it\u0027s not our time yet. And I know you\u0027re wondering why.Emily BrackenScreenwriter, Writer, Bon VivantIf you choose to forgo \"Happy Birthday\" for crooning about your \"Magic Stick,\" you\u0027d better be the guy in the Gandalf getup passing goodies out to the party-goers. You will NOT be \"making it rain\" around my girls unless you are a sprinkler technician.Mike HeenanDad, husband, author and Chief Content Creator at AtHomeDadMatters.comOf course, the National Review has every right under the First Amendment to say all of these things, and I would defend to the death, in Voltaire\u0027s words, its right to say them. But that does not make them any less offensive -- or ignorant of the law.Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe longtime pattern of the U.S.-Iran relationship: spoilers never go away, they just regroup and try to despoil again and again.John TirmanExecutive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesThe widespread cultural belief in \"soul mate ideology\" undermines our chances at happiness because it makes us passive receivers of idyllic romantic expectations.Ashley CrouchJoanna HyattWith so much of our policy debate dominated by such economists, Piketty\u0027s pointed observations can be extremely useful tool for shifting the terms of debate.Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourSo how does a regular showering guy end up going 365 days and counting without taking a shower? It started with a long bike ride across America to promote sustainability and eco-friendly living.Rob GreenfieldEco-adventurer, environmental activist and entrepreneurTwo weeks into my second year at UCLA, I was sexually assaulted by a friend and fellow Bruin during a student government retreat.Savannah BadalichFounder, 7,000 in Solidarity: A Campaign Against SexualGeorge HobicaSyndicated travel journalist and founder of Airfarewatchdog.comA Nevada rancher disputes Washington\u0027s jurisdiction over federally owned lands he uses, and thus, refuses to pay the legally required grazing fees. A number of prominent Republican politicians tacitly support the rancher\u0027s rejection of public domain by treating him as a folk hero.Edward FlattauEnvironmental newspaper columnistRyan\u0027s comments last month reflect a political climate where Republicans not only do not meaningfully speak to African American citizens, but they tell themselves and their supporters stories about politics and economics that will ensure that they do not have to speak to African American voters in the future.Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comAll video streaming companies including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and others now have to offer closed captioning by April 30, 2014 or else be subject to the same fines as traditional broadcast television.Marlee MatlinAcademy Award-winning actressI carry with me the knowledge that economics isn\u0027t about numbers, it\u0027s about people. I know now that it\u0027s up to us to decide whether the way we pay people, the work we offer them, and how we treat them on the job is just about money or if it\u0027s about society, about how we live, who we are, the nature of America.Peter Van BurenAuthor of \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"Rats! You\u0027ve received the dreaded \"thank you for your interest but...\" letter, and you really thought you were going to get that job. Maybe you were the number 2 or number 3 candidate. What now?

JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgRegardless of where one comes down on the debates about gun control, everyone seems to agree that keeping firearms out of the hands of unattended children is a good idea.Kate C. PrickettAlexa Martin-StoreyIn the 1980s, we communicated via landlines and snail mail, we enjoyed our music on Walkmans and boomboxes, and we read books using... well, books. Much has changed in the past 30 years. Yet if you put a university president from 1986 next to a university president of today, you could hardly tell them apart.Dr. Ricardo AzzizPresident, Georgia Regents UniversityThe Ukraine crisis continues. At this stage, no one can safely predict where the country will be a month from now, let alone a year down the road. Nonetheless, a few things appear crystal-clear.David HarrisAJC Executive Director, Edward and Sandra Meyer Office of the Executive Director; Senior Associate, St. Antony\u0027s College, Oxford (2009-11)Climbing Mt. Everest is no longer a noble pursuit and the people who do it are not heroes. Everest has become a magnet for the worst among us, the people with time and money to seek a personal challenge and examine their inner space at the risk of other peoples\u0027 lives.Brian RooneyEditor, TheRooneyReport.comModeling requires strength on a number of different levels -- strength to hold your head high and endure rejection; strength to continue to follow your passion in order to build a successful career; strength to ignore critics and naysayers; and strength to keep your body, mind and spirit in tip-top shape.Naomi CampbellModel, Actor, Activist, Mentor and Executive Producer of The FaceThese excuses may sound like the voice of sanity, offering perfectly good reasons why it is in fact better to stay and endure that bad job just a little longer, but look a little closer and they may not really hold up.Alexander KjerulfSpeaker, consultant and authorHopefully today\u0027s name change, while so meaningful to me personally, can also raise awareness of the fact that we trans* people exist everywhere in America today, and that we must jump through hurdles every day just for being who we are.Chelsea ManningFormer U.S. Army intelligence analyst, military whistleblower and democracy advocateIt\u0027s no longer a two-drink minimum for you. It\u0027s a two-drink maximum, or else you\u0027ll be snoozing on top of the marble slab bar before midnight.Jen GlantzAuthor (All My Friends are Engaged) \u0026 Blogger (The Things I Learned From)On May 15, the FCC will propose a new set of rules that are supposed to stop big phone and cable companies from blocking websites or discriminating against apps and services they don\u0027t like. Only as written, the rules would do pretty much the opposite.Craig AaronPresident and CEO, Free PressStudents expect these products because we currently make it socially acceptable to consume them. Children learn our cultural norms and preferences, and currently we are telling them that food has to be overwhelmingly sweet, setting them up for a lifelong preference which could negatively impact their future health.Daniel J. SchultzPublic Health NutritionistPlease repeat after me: it is never OK to publicly say an unkind thing about another human being\u0027s face. If you want women in Hollywood to stop getting plastic surgery, maybe you should just stop saying negative things about their appearance, period.Larry WomackFounder, 1450 Media; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostIt might seem odd to want to help those who have offended, injured or hurt others, but I\u0027m persuaded that simply condemning and persecuting those who offend, those who fail, is not a healthy way forward.Bryan StevensonExecutive Director, Equal Justice InitiativeBut even now, 50 years later, she says that the time she spent in Africa \"gave me a formation ... and left me with a sense of all the things you can do as one person.\" Of all her life experiences, she says, this one -- caring for families half a world away from her home country -- \"probably marked me the most.\"Cindi LeiveEditor-in-chief, Glamour; author, \u0027100 Recipes Every Woman Should Know\u0027Twenty-eight years ago, I issued an order freeing Rubin Carter from prison after he had served 19 years for murders that I am convinced he did not commit.Judge H.
