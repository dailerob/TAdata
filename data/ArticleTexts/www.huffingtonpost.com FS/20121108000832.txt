This is based on four observations; and it takes into account the regrettable fact that hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted on negative and often misleading advertising in an overly-bitter and ridiculously-expensive campaign. On Tuesday, America and Americans sent a clear signal that they understand the importance of supporting each other during times of continued economic stress and \"unusual uncertainty.\" We now need our elected representatives to put the interests of the country ahead of the legacy of backward-looking and outdated partisan commitments.

The upcoming fiscal cliff makes it particularly urgent he do so quickly.Read Post | Comments (139)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 11/07/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe big loser last night was the spiritual abuse of power that seeks to diminish the rights and dignity of others.
