{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureF. Scott Fitzgerald warned, \"There are no second acts in American lives.\" And for recent American presidents, second acts have been brutal. The hope of the first act succumbs to the karmic reckonings of the second. Nixon cast out by his crimes in Watergate. Reagan laid low by his Iran Contra follies. Clinton shamed from his personal excesses. Bush Jr. ostracized after Iraq, Katrina and economic calamity stripped away his strut. Can Barack Obama avoid that reckoning? In the wake of the Great Recession, in a country scarred by extreme inequality, a sinking middle class, spreading poverty, and a corrupted politics, can the president define and rally Americans to embrace a new foundation for growth and shared prosperity?Read Post | Comments (128)John Mackey, 01/17/13CEO, Whole Foods MarketI believe that, if the goal is universal health care, our country would be far better served by combining free enterprise capitalism with a strong governmental safety net for our poorest citizens and those with preexisting conditions, helping everyone to be able to buy insurance.Read Post | Comments (161)Bob Cesca, 01/17/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowGlenn Beck is building an amusement park called -- what else? -- Independence Park. But he\u0027s pitching it to be much more than a roadside tourist trap with a tilt-a-whirl, concessions and skeeball. Beck wants his herd of followers to believe it\u0027s a real city -- his own version of Ayn Rand\u0027s \"Galt\u0027s Gulch.\"Read Post | Comments (120)Ian Bremmer, 01/17/13Author, \u0027Every Nation for Itself\u0027We live in a global political order that has become unmoored from the underlying trend of U.S.-led globalization. We have much less of a single moral guidepost and leaders are finding it increasingly difficult to act on their moral sensibilities.Read Post | Comments (48)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 01/17/13Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureJohn Mackey\u0027s politics are bad for Whole Foods -- not just because opinions may drive customers away, but because his proposals would hurt his corporation\u0027s profitability.Read Post | CommentsLisa Belkin, 01/16/13Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostJust as it is becoming clearer that this might be the start of real change, it is also clear what is making it so: this one is about parents and children.Read Post | Comments (393)Michael Calderone, 01/16/13Senior Media Reporter, The Huffington PostDeadspin\u0027s exhaustively reported story Wednesday on Manti Te\u0027o\u0027s fake, dead girlfriend reveals how the media helped spread falsehoods that, if checked out, would have disrupted a feel good story. Te\u0027o\u0027s story was the type sportswriters -- or really, journalists in general -- flock toward.Read Post | Comments (54)Joseph A. Palermo, 01/17/13Associate professor, historian, authorWhy are these people so threatened by background checks and limits on military-style weapons? There\u0027s still going to be plenty of guns and no one is talking about forbidding hunting or recreational shooting.Read Post | CommentsEmile Hirsch, 01/16/13Actor, activistThere are no excuses for the level of lying and deception that Armstrong has possibly committed on the people of the world. But he still helped out my friend at a crucial point in his life, like he has for many others in their darkest places, and for that, I\u0027m thankful.Read Post | Comments (156)Jonathan Weiler, 01/17/13Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillThe ESPNs of the world have made \"character\" an attribute of athletic worthiness every bit as important as how fast someone runs the 40, or how far one can hit a baseball. In the process, the sports media complex has appropriated for itself the mantle of moral arbiter.Read Post | CommentsDoug Bandow, 01/17/13Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWhile recognizing that war can be necessary, Chuck Hagel understands -- out of both personal experience and practical consequence -- that war is best avoided, if possible. Unlike the war-happy neocons, he sees military force as a last resort.Read Post | CommentsHeather Bauer, RD, CDN, 01/17/13Nutritionist, Author, EntrepreneurFood and fashion aren\u0027t so different. Throughout the years, we\u0027ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly. Sometimes, we look back and say to ourselves, \"What was I thinking?\" This year is no different. Let\u0027s take a look at healthy trends that are in and the not-so-healthy trends that I hope to see on the way out!Read Post | Comments (71)John W. Boyd Jr., 01/17/13Fourth-generation farmerWhat are you hunting that requires the need of a semi-automatic weapon -- an instrument used for military warfare? This defies common sense and it should be central during the gun debate. This kind of extremism is part of the reason I do not have an NRA membership.Read Post | Comments (191)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 01/16/13CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOPaul Krugman is right: Japan is attempting a paradigm policy shift with potential systemic implications; and sustainability and success are not certain. The outcome, still too early to tell, will be consequential for Japanese society and the global economy as a whole.Read Post | Comments (117)Christopher Elliott, 01/17/13Author of the book Scammed: How to Save Your Money and Find Better Service in a World of Schemes, Swindles and Shady DealsOn her last four trips through U.S. airport security, Anita Nagelis says she\u0027s been pulled aside and subjected to a more thorough search by TSA agents, including an aggressive pat-down.

It has lagged behind the U.S. for the last two decades and, if we look at gross domestic product per capita, the gap has actually widened. Why is this?Read Post | Comments (12)Al Gore, 01/17/13Chairman, Current TVThis past week, the New York Times announced the closure of their environmental desk. Newspapers generally are under economic stress, and unfortunately, the Times is also affected. Its role in informing U.S. policy debates, however, is unique.Read Post | Comments (51)Stephanie Knaak, 01/17/13SociologistFormula feeding and early introduction of solids are two big no-nos in the new parenthood order. Both deviate from the rule of six months exclusive breastfeeding. Susie\u0027s essential quandary is this: is it justifiable for her to prioritize her own need for sleep if it means breaking this sacred rule?Read Post | Comments (36)Jonathan Schell, 01/17/13Author; Visiting fellow, YaleFor half a century we have been arguing about \"the Vietnam War.\" Is it possible that we didn\u0027t know what we were talking about? After all that has been written (some 30,000 books and counting), it scarcely seems possible, but such, it turns out, has literally been the case.Read Post | Comments (63)Brian Janosch, 01/17/13Writer-at-large for The Onion and co-founder of Cultivated WitThere\u0027s a clear causality between our excusing idolization of athletes and our idolized athletes excusing their immoral behavior to protect that hyperinflated status.Read Post | CommentsTom Zeller Jr., 01/17/13Senior Writer, The Huffington PostMuch debate has centered on the potential climate impacts of the Keystone XL pipeline project, with competing studies delivering sometimes contradictory results. Today comes another analysis, and I asked TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline, to respond.Read Post | Comments (13)Frank Sesno, 01/17/13Director, School of Media and Public Affairs, George Washington University; CEO, Face the Facts USAAs President Obama prepares to take the oath for a second term, he has an opportunity to reframe the conversation around climate change and energy. It\u0027s the right time to climb up this next mountain. And the view is always better from the top.Read Post | CommentsPaul Szep, 01/17/13Two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistRead Post | Comments (16)Matthew Dowd, 01/17/13Political strategistAs President Obama begins the turn from the end of his first term to the beginning of his second term, let us pause and see where the next four years are headed and what the president might want to be cognizant of and do in his second term.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 01/16/13Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile it\u0027s easy for parents to get angry at men like Armstrong for letting kids down, situations like his present a great opportunity to talk to kids about dealing with disappointment. And about what it means to admire someone for a particular talent or skill versus what it means to consider a person a role model. Because the two are often very different.Read Post | Comments (92)David W. Peters, 01/17/13Episcopal priest and Army Reserve ChaplainThe army was my first full-time job after graduate school. During my seven years in uniform, I did some difficult things, but leaving the army and becoming an unemployed veteran was the most difficult thing I have ever done.Read Post | CommentsAlexander B. Downes, 01/16/13Associate professor of political science and international affairs, George Washington UniversityDrone strikes are mostly killing low-level Pakistani militants, not al Qaeda leaders. This strategy is unlikely to cause the collapse of al Qaeda or even the Pakistani Taliban and may have counterproductive effects. Obama\u0027s second term may therefore require new thinking on drones.Read Post | Comments (255)Ann Brenoff, 01/17/13Senior Writer, The Huffington PostHaving cash on you, I was taught, was protection against the unknown.
