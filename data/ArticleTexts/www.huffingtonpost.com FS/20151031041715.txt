{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIt boggles the mind that the White House, in announcing the deployment of more Special Operations to Syria, still insists on saying that they won\u0027t have a \"combat mission.\" They will tell you that sending Special Operations to advise, train, and assist means troops will behind the front lines, and thus, won\u0027t be heading over with orders to join battles. I was an adviser in Iraq, in 2011, and I can tell you, they\u0027re likely to face combat, whether that\u0027s their mission, or not. Spinning military action at the outset almost always ends badly. The White House needs to be honest, and needs to prepare Americans for the lives that very well may be lost in combat.Politicians lie! I know it, you know it, we all know it! Call Bullshit is the first interactive show where you can call politicians out on all their bullshit in a funny and engaging way.Documentary filmmaker, producer and screenwriterWelcome to our annual frightfest! Each year we crank up the special effects soundtrack and present our very own scary stories for both sides of the political aisle. This year\u0027s presidential campaign is frightening enough, no matter where you sit on the political spectrum.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAs the recent presidential debate showed, the trusty old media-bashing tactic of Republican candidates was alive and well, and this season it is pushing into over-drive with a zest that would make Spiro Agnew cheer.Editor-in-Chief, AdviceIQ.comWe tell our children to control themselves while slapping and spanking and ejecting them violently in our homes, child care centers, schools, detention facilities and prisons. Adults tell children to be honest while lying and cheating and not to be violent while marketing and glorifying violence.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe Republican solutions are an agenda for their billionaire donors at the expense of the rest of us. But what else would you expect?Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureDespite the perceived flaws in being a solitary person, history has shown that even the most introverted lone wolves are capable of great success in life. Lincoln, Jobs, Gates, Einstein, Gandhi -- introverts, every last one of them. But what is one thing that stands out in all of these examples? They\u0027re all men.Singer and songwriterControlling information in a globalized world is harder than it used to be, much to the dismay of authoritarian regimes. Yet such regimes today routinely use the trappings of democracy and the latest technology to stifle liberty.Director, Cato Institute Center for Global Liberty and ProsperityWe want to know why the Federal Reserve, funded and heavily run by the banks, is keeping interest rates so low that we receive virtually no income for our hard-earned savings while the Fed lets the big banks borrow money for virtually no interest.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAt its most fundamental level, a leader is someone who influences. He may influence another person\u0027s behavior or choice. She may influence a group\u0027s dynamics or effectiveness. In fact, every person, for better or worse, has an influence every day.Founder and Executive Director, Institute for Mindful LeadershipIf the institutions and adults entrusted with protecting young people continue to enable the school-to-prison pipeline through their bias and subsequent actions, where is it that girls of color can feel safe?Philanthropic Strategist, Activist, Writer, Speaker, Transformational Leadership CoachAs it turns out, using hunter-gatherers to define what is \"healthy\" has some limitations.Biomedical anthropologist and Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of ChicagoWhen Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, called a military judge\u0027s order \"outrageous\" earlier this week, they probably didn\u0027t intend to throw a wrench into the pending 9/11 military commission case.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstBorn Denis Cuspert, the hip hop artist--who once toured with DMX--achieved a different kind of notoriety earlier this year when the State Department designated him a global terrorist, claiming he had become a top recruiter for ISIS in Syria.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.Watching how a movie is made is incredibly exciting in part because of the precision the filmmakers show in their attention to accuracy. For me, it\u0027s almost identical to being a chef -- we\u0027re both obsessed with getting it right.Acclaimed British chef, Masterchef judge, restaurateur, two Michelin star recipientAdair Turner discusses his new book, Between Debt and the Devil: Money, Credit, and Fixing Global Finance and the critical questions -- and radical solutions -- that can help lift the economy for everyone.Author and cultural theoristAlthough it is a common mantra by the GOP that government should not pick winners and losers, in fact GOP and Democratic-controlled Congresses have always picked winners and losers in the energy sector, through price and production supports, environmental regulations, and tax code advantages.Writer and environmental activistThis summer, a colleague asked me to read All the Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr. She wanted to know if the depiction of blindness within the book is realistic. I dove in and was transported.2015 Indiana Teacher of the Year, 2015 National Teacher of the Year Finalist, writer, motivational speaker, guide dog handlerThe Iranian threat, which will persist for years, if not decades, should be the catalyst for creating a formal new Arab-Israeli alignment with the strong support of the United States. The common denominators that unite them today are far greater than their disagreement over the Israeli occupation, which is an inescapable fact that Israel must bring to an end.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe US government is paying money to strategically \u0027advise and support\u0027 Myanmar\u0027s Union Election Commission (UEC), which is disqualifying Muslim parliamentarians, striking Muslims from the ballot in next week\u0027s parliamentary elections, and even blocking their right to vote.Director of Investigative Journalism, Al Jazeera Media NetworkThe basic contours of the public discourse on voter ID laws are fairly clear. In-person voting fraud is rare. As Judge Richard Posner has concluded, restrictive voter ID laws are mainly the product of Republican legislatures targeting Democratic-leaning constituencies.Distinguished Research Professor, DePaul College of Law; author; legal and political analystDuring Game Three of the World Series Friday night when the Mets host the Royals, and Citi Field is electric, there will come a point bigger than the game itself and potential will take on a new meaning when 50,000 people in a baseball stadium symbolically \"stand up to cancer.\"Former MLB Pitcher, Baseball Hall of Fame Inductee, MLB BroadcasterAs a steady, international body of research is showing, growing up with siblings offers children a matchless context in which they learn about relationships, social engagement, sharing, ownership, identity, conflict resolution, and problem solving.Professor of Psychology, Therapist, Author, Parenting media expertOur actions create our life. Confident people have greater control over their minds and have tuned their mental station to one of \"I can.\" Here are nine things that confident people do that you can apply to your life.Confidence Coach, New York CityWhat happens when you combine the most beautiful season with some of the best preserved natural land in the country?www.theactivetimes.comIt is critical for those of us concerned with human rights to shine a light on the Colombian military/paramilitary alliance which continues to plague the Afro-Colombian people with particular intensity, and which is leading to what Afro-Colombians are terming, \"ethnocide\"; others would call it \"genocide.\"Human \u0026 Labor Rights Lawyer, Adjunct Professor of International Human Rights LawWe\u0027re both powerfully drawn to the idea of a day of rest, particularly in an age when it seems increasingly unlikely that we can power down or ever power off. We spoke about our different ways of observing the Sabbath and what it has come to mean to us personally and to our families.Author, \u0027How’s Your Faith?\u0027Writer and EducatorIn 2016, only one Democratic candidate is a real Democrat on foreign policy. The other has interventionists \"pouring their hopes\" into her presidency. Don\u0027t complain about Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld if you make the wrong choice in 2016.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comIf Marco Rubio is going to keep missing more than 40 percent of the upper chamber\u0027s votes, if he is tired of being a Senator, he should follow the example of Speaker Boehner and resign.Lecturer and Doctoral Candidate, University of DenverThe reality is, that while we shine a light on efforts every October, this disease affects women and their loved ones each month of the year and we all have a responsibility to continue to support the cause long after those 31 days come to a close.Mum, Model, Actress, Bikini Designer, Organic FarmerRadical conservatives, such as Cruz, and libertarians believe gold to be a hedge against inflation. It is curious to be concerned about inflation at a time when it is at historic lows and short-term interests rates are at zero, making borrowing money just about free.bookkeeper, political observer, chess enthusiastGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
