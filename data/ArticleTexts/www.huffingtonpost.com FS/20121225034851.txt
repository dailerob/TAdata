{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Obama, mercifully, has given up the quest for a grand bargain that he never should have pursued in the first place. His current position -- let\u0027s just preserve the tax cuts on the bottom 98 percent and fight about the rest of the budget another day -- is exactly what it should have been all along. The fiscal cliff was always a misleading metaphor. When withholding goes up for everyone in the first pay period of the New Year, there will be a temporary drag on the recovery. But Republicans, even of the Tea Party variety, will be unable to withstand the political pressure. Within a month, they will approve legislation to cut taxes on the bottom 98 percent. The longer they delay, the more they will destroy their own party. Obama holds the cards.Read Post | Comments (422)David Bromwich, 12/24/12Professor of Literature at YaleBarack Obama\u0027s timidity in declining to fight a smear campaign against a courageous public servant whose honor he placed on the line may yield a perspective from which to reinterpret a few of his favorite words.

Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleThe fiscal cliff was always a terrible job-destroying idea that also began to unravel the safety net by cutting Medicare.
