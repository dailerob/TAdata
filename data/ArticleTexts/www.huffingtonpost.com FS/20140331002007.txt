{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week was the homestretch for Obamacare enrollment, with the deadline to sign up without penalty arriving tomorrow. On Thursday, the White House announced that enrollments had exceeded the CBO\u0027s estimate of 6 million. No doubt, furious debate over the program will continue into the midterm election, even as one poll finds 53 percent of Americans are tired of the endless back and forth. But now that this phase is done, how about instead of debating health insurance we focus on actual health care? Let\u0027s start with the fact that 75 percent of health care spending, and two-thirds of doctor visits, are for preventable chronic stress-related conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. As important as it is, extending access to a flawed notion of health care isn\u0027t enough. Sick care is a lot more expensive than true health care. So what if we now redirect all this energy into finding ways to prevent as many people as possible from needing treatment, whether they have insurance or not?Comments (35)David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityIf President Obama wanted to help us remember, he could have cited some numbers. Three hundred thousand Americans died in the Second World War: a terrible and frightening number. Twenty million Russians died -- one Russian out of eight. Educated Europeans know this. Few Americans of any generation know it.Comments (267)Guy KawasakiAuthor, speaker, and advisorOur two main metrics for success are money and power, and they drive us to work longer hours, sleep with our phones and tablets, miss important moments with our families and impacts our health. Arianna proposes a third metric for success: thriving.Comments (62)Craig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgHere are a few words from a nerdy perspective, which I live by to the best of my ability. One needs the finances to live comfortably, and to help friends and family do that, but seriously, know when enough is enough.CommentsSusan CainAuthor, New York Times Bestseller \u0027QUIET: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u0027t Stop Talking\u0027In honor of Arianna Huffington\u0027s marvelous book THRIVE, I want to write about a very specific aspect of well-being: freedom from fear of sharing one\u0027s ideas.Comments (19)Jonathan HaidtHenry Kaufman Visiting Professor in the Business and Society Program Area, New York University Stern School of BusinessShould leaders who want to create high-performing companies try to foster feelings of wonder in their employees? The evidence suggests that the answer is yes.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Although many people give at their own expense, there\u0027s a group of people who are productively generous. How do they do give without compromising their well-being and falling short on traditional notions of success? They reject three myths about giving.CommentsDesmond Tutu1984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerIt\u0027s not okay to be injured. It\u0027s not okay to be abused. It\u0027s not okay to be violated. It\u0027s not okay to be betrayed. But it is okay to forgive.Comments (24)Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Across the nation, parents and educators are raising objections to the Common Core standards, and many states are reconsidering whether to abandon them and the federally-funded tests that accompany them.Comments (119)Gabrielle Giffords and Mark KellyToday, you are more important than we are. It\u0027s up to you to lead. Make the choice to serve. Endeavor to do something extraordinary. And when life throws setback and challenges your way, grit your teeth and keep on going.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianChief Economic Advisor, AllianzAround 40 percent of Russia\u0027s trade is with Western Europe. Even if Russia fails to retaliate by itself imposing counter-sanctions -- an unrealistic assumption -- its weaker economy would quickly translate into lower sales by Western European companies to the world\u0027s eighth largest economy, as well as less certain input supplies from there.CommentsDarren AronofskyFilmmakerThe quarter-century anniversary of the tragic Exxon Valdez event comes as my film Noah is about to be released, and I cannot help but reflect upon the relationship between that terrible spill and the story about how God nearly annihilated the human race because our behavior in this world grieved Him to His heart.Comments (169)Naomi CampbellModel, Actor, Activist, Mentor and Executive Producer of The FaceBeing aware of your energy levels makes a big difference, because when you\u0027re working long hours, it is vital to keep your energy up in order to deliver the best performance.CommentsHugh JackmanAcademy Award Nominated ActorDespite all these problems, the global trend is that poverty everywhere is receding. Part of the reason investors are exploring African enterprises is because it is now possible to see the continent turning a corner.CommentsRichard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupAll of these innovations could be replicated by many companies all over the world and there\u0027s good reason to do so -- it\u0027s good for business.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundDuring this last week of Women’s History Month, I wanted you to learn about Ella Baker, a transforming but too-little-known woman and overpowering justice warrior for my generation of civil rights activists.CommentsCarla ShutakArtistFive years later I still cry. I cry for our hard work which benefits only the banking industry and the super-rich. I cry because the government bailed out the banks who call us irresponsible. I cry because we work four times harder for half the income and will never catch up again.Comments (284)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In using their vast wealth to change those rules and laws in order to fit their political views, the Koch brothers are undermining our democracy. That\u0027s a betrayal of the most precious thing Americans share.Comments (591)Jill DoughertyShorenstein Center fellowOnly national unity, in which the individual sets aside his own welfare for the good of the country, Putin believes, can ensure the nation will survive. Russia is a unique civilization, fully entitled to reject the values forced down its throat by the West.Comments (52)Gov. Martin O\u0027MalleyGovernor of MarylandThat\u0027s the good news. But not every loving family with same-sex parents lives in a state where their legal rights are protected. And many transgender Americans live in the 32 states where they can still lawfully be denied a job or a home solely on the basis of their identity. That is not right. And those laws need to change.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkA child\u0027s life often hinges on the level and depth of education he/she receives. We must clear out the noise and bring advocates from both sides into the same room. We cannot continue to ignore the plight of our children, and we cannot continue to attack one another.Comments (21)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorUnfortunately, despite lofty initial campaign promises by the Obama administration, widespread government secrecy has only worsened in recent years and access to information by journalists and activists is disturbingly limited.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027There is no doubt that the Texas growth path will lead to more jobs. The question is whether it creates a society where people want to live. Many people are willing to pay lots of money to live elsewhere.Comments (324)Thomas E. Perez and Sec. Kathleen SebeliusThe truth is simpler than it seems. Latino families want what all Americans want: opportunity. They want a chance at a good job, access to a good education, a better life for their kids, and security for themselves and the people they love.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAlready, three times as much money has been raised for this year\u0027s elections as four years ago, when the Citizens United decision was announced.Comments (12)Jillian BermanBusiness Reporter, The Huffington PostMy lunch is boring. It can get especially tiresome at the end of a long week when I have the same thing every day. But it fulfills my most important qualifications for a successful work lunch: It\u0027s filling and cheap.Comments (389)Harvey WeinsteinFilm ProducerAt a time when immigration reform is on every news channel and in every newspaper, this film shows a piece of the sacrifice so many made to come and live in America.Comments (30)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI live in Washington, D.C., a city in which mistakes are messaged and shortcomings are spun. True confession and true repentance do not occur -- unless it is politically advantageous. Naturally, cynicism runs rampant. In this environment, though we all know our own weaknesses, grace is rarely offered for failures.CommentsDevon CornealMother, writer, lawyerComplaining about how hard she has it while romanticizing the lives of working parents with more traditional careers means Gwyneth is either remarkably self-absorbed or deliberately obtuse.Comments (69)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Rebecca Black. Double rainbows. Nyan cat. Why do some videos made by ordinary people become internet sensations? And what do the videos we love say about who we are? YouTube\u0027s Kevin Allocca breaks it down in this nostalgic viral video tour.CommentsGary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)Twenty-five years ago or thereabouts I brought together an international consortium to build a new seaport at Novorossiysk, north of Sochi on the Russian Black Sea coast. Needless to say, the proposed world class port never got built. But if it had, it might have changed history.CommentsLincoln Mitchell, 2014.30.03Michael Giltz, 2014.30.03Rev.
