The challenge is to keep the two apart.Read Post | CommentsMichael Winship, 06.18.2010Senior writer at Bill Moyers Journal on PBSYouth is wasted on the young, they say. Ms. Cyrus certainly seems to be wasting hers, but she\u0027s in no way entirely to blame. Shame on the grown-ups who have exploited her.
