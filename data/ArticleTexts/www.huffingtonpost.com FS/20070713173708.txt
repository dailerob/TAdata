{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPAP/kotaku.comSee all posts »BIOTo hear the president spin it, today\u0027s interim progress report on Iraq is \"a mixed bag.\" According to Bush\u0027s scorecard, progress on eight of the 18 benchmarks set by Congress has been \"satisfactory,\" on another eight it has been \"unsatisfactory,\" and two are too close to call. And this, according to the president, \"is a cause for optimism.\" That\u0027s like a doctor telling you that while your child has shiny hair he also has a brain tumor -- and you coming away thinking the doctor\u0027s report is \"a mixed bag.\" That\u0027s insane. Trust me, if your kid has a brain tumor, the fact that he has nice hair or is a good speller is not going to even things out and leave you feeling optimistic.Read Post | Comments (274)BIORJ Eskow, 07.13.2007Read Post | Comments (24)BIOTerence Smith, 07.12.2007I know the political atmosphere has changed, given the ongoing agony of Iraq.
