{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Just about nothing being proposed in mainstream politics is radical enough to fix what ails the economy. Restoring a more equal economy simply can\u0027t be done by raising incomes at the bottom, even with a minimum wage high that seemed inconceivable just months ago. It requires going after the grotesquely concentrated wealth and power at the top. But here\u0027s the rub: This isn\u0027t enough. Nothing in mainstream politics takes seriously the catastrophe of global climate change. Few mainstream politicians have the nerve to call for a carbon tax. The budget deadlock and the sequester mechanism make it impossible to invest the kind of money needed to finance a green transition. This is one of those moments when there is broad popular frustration, a moment when liberal goals require measures that seem radical by today\u0027s standards. If progressives don\u0027t articulate those frustrations and propose real solutions, rightwing populists will propose crackpot ones. Token gestures won\u0027t fool anybody.To all those candidates losing their minds and expressing outrage at Donald Trump now - where were you then? Donald Trump\u0027s comments are sickening. But, so is the putrid selective outrage being displayed by his competitors in the primary.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranAs a dyslexic kid, my biggest fear in life was to go in front of the class and read because I just wasn\u0027t very good at it -- and that stays with you through your whole life. I practiced, and practiced, and practiced, and practiced to make sure I\u0027d nail it.Public speaker, activist, OlympianMost Americans struggle to recognize or understand their country\u0027s permanent security state, in which elected politicians seem to run the show, but the CIA and the Pentagon often take the lead -- a state that inherently gravitates toward military, rather than diplomatic, solutions to foreign-policy challenges. Viewed through the lens of history, the main job of U.S. presidents is to be mature and wise enough to stand up to the permanent war machine.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityAmy Schumer\u0027s Trainwreck introduces us to a new kind of mainstream film heroine: blunt, thoughtless, more interested in being gratified than likable, one whose boundless appetites are played for fun rather than derision.WriterIt\u0027s too soon to know how badly Donald Trump damaged himself by belittling John McCain\u0027s war record in Iowa on July 18. Trump himself has until now been helped, not harmed, by insulting his GOP rivals as losers, clowns, dummies and lightweights.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIn his July 17 Facebook post, Franklin Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan\u0027s Purse, spewed unhinged hatred and bigotry against American Muslims. Writing his response to the Chattanooga shooting. Such language would, and does, radicalize ignorant youth. It fosters terrorism.Lawyer, Speaker, Best-Selling Author of \"EXTREMIST\"We do not live in a post-racial society. And we will never will until this country makes it a national priority to confront the racialized myths upon which this country was built. We must lead the way in facing the complex history of racism in America and the way in which it continues to be a deadly plague upon black bodies.Author of Stand Your Ground: Black Bodies \u0026 the Justice of God, Episcopal priest, Professor and Director Of Religion at Goucher College.Disclosure of electoral spending has widespread support among the public, and it still has support among many Republican state lawmakers. ALEC, it seems, is trying to change that.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedThe president and congress should not leave out youth behind bars in efforts to reform criminal justice this year and their actions must focus on reforms at both the federal and state level. Kalief Browder and Andre Sheffield\u0027s deaths are a sobering reminder to the president and the congress of the urgency and the need to ensure youth behind bars are not left behind.President \u0026 CEO of the Youth First! InitiativeA year after the ebola epidemic took hold, we know that stronger, integrated community-based delivery systems are necessary to help prevent such outbreaks and support progress against the top killers of women and children -- especially malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea.Co-author, \u0027The Generosity Network\u0027Co-author, \u0027The Generosity Network\u0027Disconnecting forces your mind to process an event differently than if you\u0027re simply going to tweet it. It\u0027s hard to experience what\u0027s all around you when you\u0027re spending every moment with your eyes glued to a screen.Writing, Birding, Adventuring, LivingThis comedy is often so deliriously entertaining and so deftly constructed, you won\u0027t realize for a time that one of America\u0027s favorite, new, politically astute comics is having her values derailed.A lecturer at The City College of New York and has written for The Village Voice, indieWire, Soho Style, Flair, New York Daily News, and The Advocate.It appears there is nothing young, white men can do, including killing lots of innocent people at church, that will tarnish the positive bias toward that group, and there is nothing amazing enough that black men can do that will allow them to escape being perceived as the ones to be feared.Author, Speaker, ActivistMany of you are in the entrepreneurial struggle, and trust me, that\u0027s a struggle I know all too well. It can produce great outcomes but it is often brutally hard. There\u0027s a parallel struggle that has been known to produce equally great outcomes.MotherThrough the union, educators are raising our collective voice. Together with parents and students, educators are turning the tide. Teaching is our heart. Our students are our soul. And the union is our spine. When educators raise their voice and their power, we can reclaim the promise of public education.President, American Federation of TeachersTo know Bob Levinson is to know his strength, his determination and his drive -- to know his deep, unwavering love for my mother and for all my family. He will not go silently into the night. My father is as determined to get home as we are to get him home. But we need Iran\u0027s help.Wife, mother, financial services employee, and advocate for her father, Bob Levinson, the longest held hostage in U.S. history.Any foreign agreement, no matter how good it is, should not be allowed to countenance continued aggrandizement of executive power and further subversion the republic\u0027s Constitution.Senior Fellow and Director of the Center on Peace \u0026 Liberty, The Independent InstituteTrump is leading or doing well in several national and early state polls. That\u0027s why the other candidates and all Republican leaders should be denouncing his ignorance and xenophobia more forcefully.Attorney; USA Today Columnist, NBCNews.com ContributorHuman beings find it tough to give and receive feedback. Many of us — let’s be real, all of us — get defensive when we hear it, and we assume nobody wants to hear it from us. So feedback gets chronically buried and put off. But it doesn’t have to.Co-Founder, AsanaIt\u0027s a woman\u0027s prerogative to change her hair. But when body hair changes without our permission? Then it\u0027s our imperative to check it out. Because hair is a signifier -- its presence, its gain, or its loss -- hair is always trying to tell us something.Prevention provides service journalism at its best: news, perspective-shifting features and practical strategies to enhance lives.In the past, he has advocated government health care, an assault weapons ban, and 14.25 percent flat tax on all wealthy Americans. Now he opposes all three. Does he stand for anything, other than promoting Donald Trump?Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolI chose my son because, when the moment came and I had the option, he felt like the only choice to make.Writer. Sports lover. Whiskey drinker. Mom.Trump\u0027s whole agenda is provocation, which isn\u0027t to say he doesn\u0027t believe what he\u0027s saying. But he\u0027s also so over the top, so almost unbelievably bold, that he\u0027s become something of a parody of himself. And it feels as if he\u0027s fully in on the joke, which he may be. We could use a little provocation.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIn the weeks following the unspeakable gun violence in Charleston, there was one public voice notably absent, namely, the NRA. This time America\u0027s \"oldest civil rights organization\" kept their collectives mouths shut. Well, almost all of them did.Mike the Gun GuyUltimately, it does not matter whether Pluto is called a planet or not. People get together, exchange arguments, give new names to the things around them. But Pluto is whatever it is, and has not changed a bit since we demoted it into a dwarf planet.Associate professor of physics in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences.BRISTOL -- Populism appeals to the \"will of people\" but is actually profoundly undemocratic. Democracy is about the negotiation of competing interests and the balancing of different values. Populism, in contrast, is a kind of mob rule. Where there is complexity, it offers simple solutions. Instead of seeking common ground, it looks to exaggerate the differences between them and us.Founding editor, The Philosophers’ MagazineSince President Barack Obama announced in December 2014 that the United States plans to restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba, avid travelers have been preparing to visit the small Caribbean nation. But it\u0027s not as easy as you might think.U.S. News \u0026 World Report TravelThis week, President Obama has put a much-needed spotlight on the vicious cycle of mass incarceration. In the past three decades, the prison population in the U.S. has ballooned due to a number of factors that have created a system rife with discrimination and other abuses.Executive Director, Amnesty International USAWhen speaking out means sacrificing privacy, we lose points of view, and the quality of our democracy suffers. That should give all of us something to truly fear.Brynne O\u0027Neal is a Research and Program Associate at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.Instead of being a model for how a predatory for-profit could become a non-profit, as the Department of Education had publicly hoped, so far ECMC looks like a pioneer in running a predatory non-profit.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
