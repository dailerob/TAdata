{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, assistant professor of psychology at Cornell Medical SchoolWith a life-long interest in political leadership, I thought I had seen it all: from selfless and inspiring to venal and creepy -- and all points in between. But I was simply unprepared for Christine O\u0027Donnell, the Tea Party-backed candidate running for a Delaware U.S. Senate seat. If we face the facts, we know that she was plucked from the side-show division of political obscurity because of her looks. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with that. Or unusual. And even if she is a witch, she\u0027s a cute one. Today, with enough financial backing and some positions just to the right of crazy -- that might be enough.Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 10.14.2010Founder of GlobalGrind.comBarack Obama has been a tremendous leader and an inspiration to us all.

Deputy Speaker, Israeli Knesset; President, New Israel FundAsking others to define Israelis by our Jewishness will not make us more Jewish or more secure. It will not give us more legitimacy. Only we can decide who we are as a people.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 10.14.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureHow did we reach such a state of confusion about the solvency of Social Security? Actuaries deal in probabilities and statistics. What were the odds we\u0027d be so confused in 2010?Read Post | CommentsAlec Baldwin, 10.13.2010ActorWhere schools are failing, we owe it to others and to ourselves to examine why. The belligerent, class-baiting vitriol you so often hear when there is any criticism of education in this country is ill-advised and unwelcome.Read Post | CommentsMichael Vlahos, 10.14.2010Writer and National Security expertThe nation in modernity no longer needs war to clear our pathways for collective meaning and national transcendence. Chile\u0027s miners offer an alternative ritual venue -- and an alternative take on nationalism and sacred identity.Read Post | CommentsDr. Harold Koplewicz, 10.14.2010National leading child and adolescent psychiatrist; president, The Child Mind InstituteI know that many parents find it difficult to discuss sexuality with their teens, but discussion is crucial if we want our teens to develop good self-esteem, embrace their own differences, and accept what is different in others.Read Post | CommentsMuhtar Kent, 10.13.2010Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, The Coca-Cola CompanyLet\u0027s for the moment forget all the talk about the \"China Century\" or the \"India Century\" or the \"BRIC Century.\" The real story is that the 21st century is going to be the \"Women\u0027s Century.\"Read Post | CommentsAmy B. Dean, 10.13.2010Co-Author, \"A New New Deal: How Regional Activism Will Reshape the American Labor Movement\"Every time the Democrats are too timid to promote a policy solution that the party\u0027s base actually wants, they walk into a trap. We\u0027re now seeing with Obama what we saw with Clinton.Read Post | CommentsAzeem Ibrahim, 10.13.2010Research Fellow, Harvard Kennedy School’s International Security ProgramNine years after the start of the war, the Taliban controls 70% of Afghanistan. Though it is heart-rending to consider abandoning the progress that has been made, the truth is that there simply is no military solution.Read Post | CommentsJacob Soboroff, 10.13.2010Co-Host, NBC\u0027s \"School Pride\"A new show beginning this week lifts the \"makeover\" concept to a whole new level by helping ordinary Americans make a difference for public school students caught in dismal situations.Read Post | CommentsAndy Borowitz, 10.13.2010Comedian and creator of BorowitzReport.comMr. and Mrs. Salahi, who are perhaps best known for crashing a state dinner at the White House last year, waved to cameras as they emerged from a Chilean, Mrs. Salahi attired in her trademark floor-length red dress.Read Post | CommentsRobert K. Lifton, 10.13.2010Fmr.

Nobody has any idea who\u0027s running against Kirsten Gillibrand, or that Chuck Schumer is up for re-election. Carl Paladino may be the only Democratic election strategy that works this November.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 10.13.2010The Washington Post is just diligently exploring both sides of the issue!

Jesse Jackson, 10.13.2010Civil rights activistIf Republicans take control of Congress and carry through on their promise to roll back spending on jobs while cutting taxes for the wealthy, we\u0027ll see even more pink slips and fewer paychecks.
