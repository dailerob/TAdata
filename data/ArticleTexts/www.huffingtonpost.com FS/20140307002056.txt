{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Stephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationPresident Obama appears to be using a strategic approach to the Ukrainian situation that is similar in many respects to that employed by his Democratic Party predecessor, President John F. Kennedy, in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In both cases, the two leaders were dealing with secret, unexpected, armed missions launched by aggressive Russian leaders against Western interests, with little precedent in both cases on how to handle the crises. Obviously the Cuban missile affair was a far more perilous showdown than what is now happening in the Ukraine. The Cuban affair had doomsday-type consequences. The invasion of Crimea does not entail any possibility of nuclear exchanges between two nations. But in other respects, there are parallels for Obama.Comments (26)Nadia Tolokonnikova and Masha AlyokhinaWhen we arrived to visit a women\u0027s prison with our prison-reform organization, unknown men attacked us with blinding liquid.

I remember.CommentsHarry BelafonteEntertainer \u0026 ActivistThere is a crisis that demands our urgent attention. For the last four decades, this country has been obsessed with expanding the number of people we throw behind bars and the length of time we hold them there.Comments (16)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostIt might be useful to take a break from talking about what individual dramas are doing and talk instead about what HBO -- and other critically acclaimed TV outlets -- are not doing.Comments (350)Richard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupMore businesses should be following Apple\u0027s stance in encouraging more investment in sustainability. While Tim Cook told sustainability skeptics to \"get out of our stock,\" I would urge climate change deniers to get out of our way.Comments (33)Lori LeibovichExecutive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington PostIt hurts to do my job, lift my daughter, carry grocery bags, or make it through the day without popping Advils. The message my body is sending is clear: Stop typing, tapping and scrolling, now.CommentsSen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontThe Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service.Comments (105)Shireen AhmedWriter and advocate focusing on Muslim women in sportsHow can I laud FIFA for striking down a law that should have never been implemented in the first place? Being ripped from the game because a lot of white, privileged men decided it was dangerous for me and the sport was torturous. Football is for all of us. It should always have been.CommentsRobin Kevles-NecowitzLicensed professional counselor and parenting coachChildhood isn\u0027t easy. And it\u0027s a whole lot harder when parents are counting on their children to make them happy -- with a good grade, a positive attitude, a full social calendar, a home run at the game, a scholarship, great SAT scores and perfect attendance.CommentsEmily CohnEditor, HuffPost BusinessIt didn\u0027t take me long to realize what Chipotle was really doing by adding tofu (aka Sofritas) to its menu: It had cleverly devised a way to get vegetarians to pay more for a meatless burrito. Now, vegetarians can spend just as much as omnivores.Comments (21)Larry CrandellVolunteer \u0026 RaconteurI\u0027m older than Scotch tape. And it was invented in 1930. I\u0027ve lived through the Great Depression and served in the Army Air Corps in World War II. At 90 and ¾, I only date women who like antiques.Comments (22)Sean KaySean Kay is Robson Professor of Politics at Ohio Wesleyan UniversityAs significant as Crimea is, there are no solutions to either Ukraine -- or North Korea, Afghanistan, Syria, and Iran -- that do not involve the Russians, as unappetizing as that might be. We face tough choices that can only be answered with a wider set of interests at play.CommentsKatie GibsonFreelance radio producer and audio editorI had everything. I had the perfect apartment, the perfect lifestyle (whatever that even means), the perfect husband, the perfect dog, the perfect job. I was bouncy lollipops and rainbows happy. That is, until it all fell apart faster than you can say downsizing.CommentsTovah FeldshuhActressMothers and Sons, refreshingly imagines a world that the backyard barbecue guests of my childhood could probably never have imaginedCommentsMattea KramerResearch director, National Priorities ProjectDespite cries of doom since the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration surfaced in Washington in 2011, the Pentagon has seen few actual reductions, and there is no indication that will change any time soon.CommentsMichael Anthony FernandezFounder, Factory 360Would you ever think that Courtney Love would be the inspiration for restructuring an entire office culture -- which included building a yoga studio in our new office? Well, she was, and this is what happened.CommentsGov. Deval PatrickGovernor, MassachusettsAs a black man, my heart aches over the disproportionate numbers of men and boys of color left back by schools, left out of jobs and caught up in crime. As a black public official, I am struck by how little appetite there seems to be among law makers to deal with the root causes of this.Comments (12)Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeFor too long, reporters have been bamboozled by Ryan, who claims to be a both a budget expert and something of a social philosopher. But he\u0027s just a slick talker who appears to have flunked basic math in high school or college, because his budget numbers never add up.Comments (28)Claire FallonBooks Editor, The Huffington PostHere are the 10 worst pieces of dating advice from Marry Smart -- and trust me, there was plenty of bad advice from which to choose.Comments (28)Caleb WildeSixth generation licensed funeral directorPerhaps there\u0027s no greater freedom than to live life with a healthy relationship with death. That healthy relationship allows you embracing each moment, realizing that we are not promised tomorrow. This good relationship with death has been given to me by the funeral profession.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comWashington and Kabul have, for endless months, been performing a strange pas de deux over the issue of American withdrawal. The less Karzai complied, the more Obama administration and Pentagon officials betrayed an overwhelming need to stay.CommentsSoraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderThe dynamics of domestic violence are complex and changing them requires not just one thing to change, but many things simultaneously.CommentsScott LillySenior fellow, Center for American ProgressAs the uproar over the CBO analysis demonstrates, the issue of whether jobs are gained or lost as a result of a minimum-wage increase depends largely on how we analyze the vast amount of research that has been conducted on the question over the past half-century.CommentsZoë TriskaSenior Books Editor, The Huffington PostWhat\u0027s not so nice? Having to wait for said person you love in order to watch the rest of the fully-released season.

But they will be sincerely mistaken.CommentsMaddie CrumBooks Editor, The Huffington PostThis forceful call for more forceful writing is misguided; adverbs can be phonetically pleasing, can imbue sentences with subtlety, and should not be entirely shunned.CommentsCheryl Saban Ph.D.Author and advocate for women and childrenThe status of the world\u0027s women will be discussed in depth during the upcoming CSW58 in New York City. The Commission of the Status of Women is arguably the highest authority on issues of gender equality and the empowerment of women at the global level.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The amount that we share online makes us more likely to feel like sharing widely is a normal thing, online and off. But the ease with which we publicize seemingly harmless bits of personal information online and off is often what scam artists rely upon when they go phishing.CommentsDr. Amy ShahDouble board certified in Internal Medicine and Allergy \u0026 ImmunologyIn order for us to continue to advance in the workplace and home, we must literally and figuratively remove the airbrushed media images of female success and tame our own unrealistic expectations for ourselves.CommentsSandra Bond Chapman, Ph.D.Cognitive neuroscientist; Founder and Chief Director, Center for BrainHealth, University of Texas at DallasWith all the buzz about brain games -- such as crossword puzzles, Sudoku, and even brain training websites -- it begs the question: Can brain games be beneficial to brain health?
