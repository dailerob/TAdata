{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesOne of the standard tropes of American politics is about global leadership. The automatic assumption on nearly all pressing issues is that we lead, and one of the charges typical of presidential campaigns is that the other candidate doesn\u0027t, can\u0027t or won\u0027t lead. But now, on the most momentous concern of our time, a sizable number of the political class -- including White House aspirants -- are insisting we forego global leadership because the United States doesn\u0027t matter to the fate of the issue. That concern is climate change. The opportunity for leadership is tethered to a 20-year United Nations treaty process culminating in Paris in the next two weeks. And those saying it doesn\u0027t matter are the big names in the Republican Party.It\u0027s time for us to stop being polite and keeping the peace in our families, to stop hiding behind sympathetic posts on social media and instead have hard discussions about where we, as families, are at. To tell those close to us how afraid we are that, some day, we might see their mugshot on television after a horrific event.Writer, sexual advocate, religious educator, business consultant, cultural critic, and (sometimes) excellent cook.For months now, the pundits and the GOP establishment have dismissed the dangers posed by the likes of Trump and Carson and Cruz. But as their rhetoric becomes harsher, with naked appeals to intolerance and even violence, it is time to wake up. Because they speak to an entire group\u0027s existential crisisPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The shooter had help. He had help from an entire movement that has carelessly labeled abortion as \"murder\" and \"baby-killing.\" Killing abortion providers flows logically from the moment you call abortion \"murder\" and this labeling has to stop. Now.Playwright and Political Science Professor; Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityThe scientific community agrees on a crucial fact: we must leave most remaining fossil fuels in the ground, or our children and future generations are screwed. Yet Obama is not proposing the action required for the essential change in energy policy direction.Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteIn the aftermath of the recent mass shooting at Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs, it\u0027s time we examine the role of words in our politics and in our society. Those who defensively insist that their vicious verbal attacks on Planned Parenthood have nothing to do with a single gunman\u0027s massacre of innocent citizens are fooling themselves.Best-selling author, speaker, and human relations expert.It\u0027s possible to have a flexible economy and also provide workers some minimal level of security. A decent society requires no less.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027The Thanksgiving feast may be over, but your houseguests will still be hungry. Don\u0027t stress yourself out by being a short order cook. Most of these brunch recipes can be made in advance, and all of them have some serious \"wow-factor.\"Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomThe Showtime documentary, \"The Spymasters: CIA in the Crosshairs,\" which will air Saturday night, pulls the curtain back on America\u0027s most secret agency and sheds light on its successes and failures.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorIf we are serious about changing the climate, we need to get serious about changing agriculture.Author of \"The Omnivore\u0027s Dilemma,\" \"In Defense of Food\"Donald Trump\u0027s toxic comments about immigrants and women are completely counter to the spirit of my late husband Gene Kelly. Not only would Gene be appalled by Trump\u0027s deplorable words and actions, he would be stricken that such depravity could be tolerated in a race for President of the United States.Writer, Trustee of The Gene Kelly Image TrustAs President Obama flies to Paris for the latest international negotiation on climate change, diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic appear confused about what his position will be. Will he champion legally binding commitments by all nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions? Or will he agree only to deal with no legal force?Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectThis week\u0027s episode of KCRWs \"Scheer Intelligence\" features Truthdig Editor-in-Chief Robert Scheer in conversation with Dennis Kucinich, Ohio\u0027s eight-term congressman and two-time Democratic presidential candidate, who reveals tales about the underbelly of politics going back to his days as the \"Boy Mayor\" of Cleveland on the late 1970s.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027I am tired of letting the loudest among us be those who call for un-American behavior in the name of patriotism. I am tired of letting the dialogue be monopolized by those who pass off prejudice as faith. Compassion matters. Dignity matters. Standing for something worthwhile is rarely easy.Coach, Consultant, Writer. Providing indivduals and organizations with the tools for well-beingScandal took the biggest leap in recent history by featuring a one-minute abortion procedure, which marked the first time since Roe vs. Wade that a main female TV character underwent the procedure. And it was not all that dramatic, which is the exact point we are trying to make about abortion.carafem, Vice PresidentDear Mrs. Merkel, Germans are noticing the shift that has just begun. They notice that after this eventful decade, Germany is about to change profoundly. And they need somebody to explain this transition to them.Editor in Chief, HuffPost GermanyIn striving to combat the most violent evil terror facing the world today, neither avoidance nor surrender is an option. This is true both for efforts to bring political stability to Syria as well as obliterating ISIS. It is also true, however, for holding steadfast to our bedrock principles of American exceptionalism and inclusion.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe struggle with jihadism is in fact a world war with multiple front lines scattered across the world\u0027s major cities. That conclusion is inescapable. It is not the Third World War, because it has little in common with the first two. It is therefore possible to say that this is the first \"World War\" fought by asymmetric forces simultaneously across the globe.Best Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Keynote SpeakerIt wasn\u0027t easy surviving on the streets, while at the same time, going to school everyday. At age 14, for me and for many LGBTQ youth, getting ready for school the night before looked very different than it does for the average youth.Advocate for LGBT youthCOP21 represents one of those rare opportunities to change the course of human history. I believe that a net-zero target is achievable by 2050. It shouldn\u0027t worry us. To be honest, I couldn\u0027t think of a more exciting opportunity. .Founder, Virgin GroupAlthough the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has repeatedly pledged to comply with various Human Rights conventions, it nonetheless repeatedly has trampled the basic human rights of Waleed and others who are now languishing in Saudi prisons with crippling sentences of 15, 20 and 30 years.Managing partner, Arshack, Hajek \u0026 LehrmanWhen we think of climate change, we tend to picture rising sea levels, higher temperatures, expanding deserts, more violent storms, melting ice caps. But we should also think of wasted fields and hungry people, because climate change poses a tremendous threat to our food supply for all countries.Minister for Agriculture, Agrifood and Forestry, FrancePresident, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)Long before I ever set foot in an actual, working newsroom, I was a sucker for movies and TV shows about journalism and reporter. If you haven\u0027t already heard, to the list of superb movies about the trade, you can now add Spotlight.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.The power of the film is that it won\u0027t let us forget that it\u0027s within our power to avoid the worst consequences of climate change -- we need only choose to do so. That\u0027s important for all of us to remember, not just those who are tasked with reaching an agreement in Paris.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubI\u0027ve frequently been surprised by people reporting okay days after seriously sleepless nights. In large part, this is a testament to the human capacity for resilience. But it\u0027s also a direct result of using sensible strategies to manage the day after. Here are 10:Sleep and dream specialistA number of schools are considering firing their longtime successful coaches, in the hopes of getting a more successful one. Should they do so?Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaI call upon all believers of equality to unite and to work to put an end to such acts of violence, injustice and discrimination against Iranian women. They should stand up and declare systematic opposition to the theocratic regime, whose medieval, inhumane treatment of women has no place in the civilized world.Iran\u0027s former crown princeMy family\u0027s journey epitomizes the mythic American Dream. The United States is a land of immigrants -- beginning with the Pilgrims that inspired Thanksgiving -- who come for freedom and opportunity. And that\u0027s why the debate over Syrian refugees hits home for me.Blogger - JimmyWin.com; Host, \u0027Speak Up With Jimmy\u0027; diversity \u0026 innovation advocate; founder, DiverseStory Project; digital media \u0026 technology lawyer and advisor; speech expertIf we can reduce human suffering, we can reduce addiction.
