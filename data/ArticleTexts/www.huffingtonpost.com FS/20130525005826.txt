{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWe don\u0027t tend to think of women as sexist, largely because historically, sexism has been something perpetrated by men towards women. But sexism refers simply to unequal treatment in relation to a person\u0027s gender. It often involves a power dynamic -- common in the workplace -- and can happen to, and be inflicted by, anyone. Many feminists have rejected the notion that women can be sexist towards men because women lack the institutional power than men have. Except we know that\u0027s changing, most notably at work, as more females rise to management positions, a trend that will only continue to grow, since women now comprise the majority of college and graduate students nationwide.Comments (403)JD SchrammLecturer, Stanford Graduate School of BusinessNo conversation, no matter how meaningful and powerful, can bring back the millions we\u0027ve already lost to suicide. But we may very well prevent the next loss to suicide if we can all continue to break the silence and share our journeys.Comments (68)Dr. Jill BidenSecond Lady of the United StatesThis Memorial Day, I hope you will take a moment to offer your own gesture of thanks to our men and women serving abroad and at home, as well as their families, and take a moment to honor the service men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice.Comments (39)J. J. Abrams and Bryan BurkWhen we began work on Star Trek Into Darkness, we realized it would be released in May 2013, a moment when our nation would have the opportunity and responsibility to make sure we help these post-9/11 veterans transition back to jobs, higher education, or ongoing careers of service.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAllow me please to take you back for a moment to the beginning of 2011. Remember how surprised the world was that, in just 18 days, a leaderless grass-root uprising managed to topple the Mubarak regime that had ruled Egypt with an iron fist for 30 years?CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027All these men are honorable. None has broken any law. But they and their ilk in congress -- the Democrats who are now rolling back Dodd-Frank -- don\u0027t seem to appreciate the extent to which Wall Street has harmed, and continues to harm, America.Comments (163)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAmerica has a spiritual problem when it protects guns rather than children. Why are we not all calling our legislators and expressing outrage? How can we let the voices of gun dealers and manufacturers drown out the cries of children?Comments (20)Dr. Gail GrossFamily \u0026 Child Expert, Educator, Author. Ph.D. Ed.D.If you\u0027re one of the many families getting ready to get away from it all this summer, here are some tips for a stress-free summer vacation.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen I was a child, the only women you were likely to encounter on the front lines of America\u0027s military didn\u0027t wear uniforms. Instead, they wore high heels, hose and sequins. That\u0027s because these women were not among our soldiers but, instead, part of the U.S.O.Comments (65)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Why should middle-class students pay more for loans than is absolutely necessary, all the while padding the government\u0027s coffers and enabling state universities to build facilities that the students will only get to use for four years?Comments (147)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s special summer issue, we\u0027re putting the spotlight on all the season\u0027s diverse offerings, with an emphasis on ways to enjoy the summer with less stress -- from guides to the best of entertainment, culture and lifestyle to tips and new twists on how to make the most of beloved summer pastimes.CommentsEdit SchlafferFounder, Women Without Borders/SAVEWestern anti-Muslim sentiment needs to be balanced by Muslims voicing their determination to confront the Islamist threat and expose the abuses of Islam by a small minority of extremists.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesContinuing to ban lesbian den mothers and gay scoutmasters is sending a horrible message to American youth, including the scouts, gay and straight. The Boy Scouts of America made this change to take some of the heat off, and no matter what equality advocates hope for, that will happen.Comments (363)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityOmar Bakri Mohammed, 54, who has harnessed a dangerous sliver of American and British youth to religious terror and extremism is a notorious English-speaking hate cleric who for almost two decades, while on public assistance, fomented radicalism in the United Kingdom.Comments (106)Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeIf the Waltons really wanted to make positive change in children\u0027s educations and lives, they would steer far clear of Michelle Rhee and her troublesome track record.CommentsLea LaneAuthor, Travel Tales I Couldn\u0027t Put in the GuidebooksSometimes, especially when a person seems to have a satisfying life, we dismiss suicidal signals that would otherwise alert us. I know this first-hand.Comments (53)Liz KozakWriter, MomI know deep down that she\u0027s the little person she\u0027s meant to be and that she\u0027s on her own journey and that she is in fact human -- not a snorty piglet. But I can\u0027t get one irksome question out of my mind.Comments (40)Bill McKibbenAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Ever since the Keystone fight began, the smart money has insisted the pipeline will be approved. But so far: no pipe.CommentsBrenda ChapmanBrave Writer and Co-DirectorThe message Disney sends to the public in changing Merida is that she is not good enough the way she is. In doing that, they are making the same statement to all the young girls out there.Comments (53)Jeffrey Bland, Ph.DPresident, Personalized Lifestyle Medicine InstituteMore and more, health professionals from varied fields put their energies, time and money toward gaining the knowledge and experience necessary to effectively embrace the power of nutrition. But astonishingly, health professionals with nutrition tools to reverse chronic health conditions are gagged in many states.CommentsElliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsEvery time journalists cite contrarian scientists or industry-funded think tank spokespeople, they validate them as a trustworthy source. And every time journalists fail to disclose where contrarians get their funding, they fail to explain whose interests they serve.Comments (35)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsLet\u0027s hope when the next Memorial Day rolls around, the good news will be that changes have been made. Our military women deserve to be safe from attack by their own ranks. Those who assault their peers and dishonor the country in the bargain deserve to be punished, not protected.Comments (53)Dennis KravetzPsychologist, physical fitness buff, business consultant and writerWhat does it mean to be \"psychologically young\"? It\u0027s not about wrinkle creams, plastic surgery, or injections to make you look younger. It\u0027s about having a positive mental attitude, staying cognitively and physically active, and having a high-quality life.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a new comprehensive immigration reform bill with a bipartisan vote. It isn\u0027t perfect, but the key elements that many of us have been fighting for are intact. That really is a triumph of the common good.Comments (13)Lee WoodruffCo-author, \u0027In an Instant\u0027, Author, \u0027Perfectly Imperfect\u0027, Author, \u0027Those We Love Most\u0027On Memorial Day, we\u0027ll remember those who died in service to our country. But this year, my thoughts are also with our injured service members and their families -- the folks who carry the biggest burden when loved ones return, different, broken, hurting.CommentsBrynn TannehillDefense research scientistWhen the Mormon Church officially endorsed the Boy Scouts\u0027 new \"young gays OK, grown-up gays bad\" position, I pricked up my ears. I asked myself, \"What does this organization have to gain from it?\" Simply put: everything.Comments (19)Kenneth Barish, Ph.D.Clinical Associate Professor of Psychology at Weill Medical College, Cornell UniversityWhat can we do? How can we avoid frequent criticism and still provide children with the guidance and instruction they need?CommentsJim MoretChief Correspondent, \u0027Inside Edition\u0027; attorney; author, \u0027The Last Day of My Life\u0027Let\u0027s stop this madness. Take away the cameras and microphones and put her away for good. Jodi Arias may still long for her close-up, but this mistrial is a wake-up call to silence her voice.Comments (25)John DearChristian peace activist, author of \u0027Lazarus, Come Forth!\u0027 and \u0027A Persistent Peace.\u0027 www.johndear.org, blogs at www.ncronline.orgThis 50th anniversary reminds me that in the David-and-Goliath-like battle that pitted Martin Luther King, Jr., school children and the best of the Civil Rights movement against the Ku Klux Klan and white racists -- active nonviolence can transform anything.CommentsCommittee to Protect JournalistsBy ensuring the effective prosecution of journalists\u0027 killers and halting the era of anti-press violence, Sharif and his new government will be protecting Pakistani democracy for years to come.CommentsRev. Mary Robin CraigPastor, Nankin (OH) Federated ChurchIf we are people of faith, we are called to embody the recklessly abundant love of a God from whom nothing can separate us.
