{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonGreetings from Germany! I\u0027m in Munich for the launch of The Huffington Post Deutschland. We are delighted to be partnering with Hubert Burda Media\u0027s Tomorrow Focus, one of Germany\u0027s fastest-growing digital media companies. HuffPost Deutschland -- which will be led by our editorial director Cherno Jobatey and editor-in-chief Sebastian Matthes -- will be both a journalistic outlet and a blogging platform for Germany, Austria and Switzerland. We will be relentlessly covering politics and news at a very fascinating moment in German history, as well as putting a spotlight on how Germans of all generations are dealing with the Third Metric, which is what we call redefining success beyond the first two metrics of money and power to include well-being, wisdom, wonder, compassion and giving. After all, Germans came up with the fabulous concept of Gemütlichkeit, which captures a state of coziness, intimacy and an unhurried tempo that we so desperately need in modern life.Comments (188)Barbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistAs we now enter the third week of the unnecessary government shutdown, Americans should remember the words of GOP Representative Martin Stutzman, \"We\u0027re not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don\u0027t know what that even is.\"Comments (173)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The radicals who tried to hijack America didn\u0027t understand one very basic thing. While most Americans don\u0027t like big government, Americans revere our system of government.Comments (101)Kirk DouglasActorI had a stroke about 15 years ago. I lost my voice. Now what does an actor do who loses his voice -- give up? No, he waits for silent pictures to come back. I can joke about it now, but it wasn\u0027t funny then.Comments (16)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorInstead of developing a democratic process in which teachers, scholars and specialists were consulted at every step in the process -- instead of trying out the standards to see how they work in real classrooms -- the Gates Foundation and the Department of Education took a shortcut.Comments (33)Sebastian MatthesEditor in Chief, HuffPost DeutschlandThe Huffington Post sees itself as a platform where readers, experts and journalists discuss, argue and promote important issues of our time. We believe that the time for this has arrived. We want to continue this story in Germany -- and accompany the debates of our time in new waysCommentsEllen DolgenAuthor, \u0027Shmirshky: The Pursuit of Hormone Happiness\u0027Ladies, we deserve to have the best sex of our lives -- now! Even better, it\u0027s completely doable (pun intended). During our menopausal years, our sex lives have so much from which they can benefit: a strong sense of self, deep relationships, and bodies we actually know how to use!CommentsSen. Jay RockefellerU.S. Senator, West VirginiaIf my colleagues won\u0027t listen to my arguments for why we must not delay and vote to raise the debt ceiling, I do hope they listen to President Reagan.Comments (88)Nicolas BerggruenFounder and chairman, Berggruen HoldingsThough the combined votes of the SPD, the Greens and the Left were greater than the votes for the CDU and its allies in the recent election, Angela Merkel for all intents and purposes has been given a mandate to continue her European policy that prioritizes austerity.Comments (36)Niall FergusonLaurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford UniversityI have shown that Paul Krugman failed to anticipate the financial crisis and wrongly predicted that the single European currency would fall victim to it. I have exploded his claim to intellectual invincibility. Very clearly, he has made at least twice as many major mistakes in his career as the mere two he has previously admitted to.Comments (430)Lori LeibovichExecutive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post\"We get into the habit of treating all messages as equally urgent, but we\u0027ve also come to like the feeling of staying in the loop because it\u0027s a way of proving our own importance,\" Pang says.CommentsHenry GeeSenior Editor, Nature; Author, \u0027The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings About Human Evolution\u0027The idea that science worships anything as its \u0027God\u0027 is quite appalling, for it suggests that scientists are not engaged in a dispassionate examination of nature but are seeking to replace one religion with another. God is quite unnecessary in science, even as a metaphor.Comments (57)Jesse KornbluthEditor of HeadButler.comThe lives of little people. We see them on the street, and, if we are curious, we wonder about their lives. Alice Munro does our homework for us -- she inhabits those lives. Her judgments are sure. And tough. And also... human.CommentsDan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostAre you frustrated? Tired of gridlocked government? Wish this whole shutdown thing would just end? Introducing: \"Liberty,\" the traditional word utilized by conservatives that can mean whatever you want it to!Comments (64)John PrendergastCo-founder, Enough ProjectThe regime in which Hamad serves has ruled Sudan with an iron fist since its coup in 1989. It\u0027s time for a real peace process that can set forth the terms of peaceful democratic change. The Sudanese people are in the streets, resiliently calling for change.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027We\u0027re hearing lots of babble at the Capitol, but across the street, we\u0027re trying to hear the word of God -- what God says about the people, families, and children who will suffer the most because of Washington\u0027s babble.CommentsAlissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgI miss Em a lot lately. I miss everything about her sweet, beautiful face smiling up at me. There are days when my face, I am sure, looks a lot like Emilie\u0027s did the day we let her butterflies go.Comments (155)Adrian Grenier and Peter GlatzerAt SHFT, we find it pretty astonishing that in our world of unprecedented access to information, science and technology well over 100 members of the United States Congress are climate change deniers.CommentsBryan MaygersDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostDespite wrapping up qualification for the 2014 World Cup last month against arch-rival Mexico, there\u0027s no shortage of storylines as the United States men\u0027s national soccer team heads into their final two matches of the CONCACAF qualifying hexagonal.CommentsDavid JonesGlobal CEO, Havas; Co-Founder, One Young WorldWhile one group of senior leaders in America were causing a government to close, another group of brilliant young leaders were gathering in Johannesburg for the fourth annual One Young World summit. The contrast between the two couldn\u0027t have been more stark.CommentsMuhammad YunusNobel Peace Prize winner; founder, Grameen Bank; chairman, Yunus Social BusinessI have always said that human beings are multidimensional beings. Their happiness comes from many sources, not as our current economic framework assumes, just from making money.CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolWhat about today\u0027s texting toddlers who grow up thinking that lol is a word? Are we raising a generation of illiterates whose fuzzy spelling is the precursor of fuzzy thinking?Comments (23)Benjamin Todd JealousPresident and CEO, NAACPFor the first time in years, widespread minimum wage reform is a real possibility, and we need to keep the pressure on. The current federal minimum wage is inadequate, outdated, and out of touch with the modern cost of living.Comments (11)ApopoAPOPO uses existing demining technology as well as its innovative Mine Detection Rats (MDRs) to fulfill its mission of a mine free world.CommentsCraig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgI want news I can trust. I know this is not a simple problem. But it starts with journalists using their expertise and authority to accurately describe what is happening.CommentsJanet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceWho are the reprobates that are cheering for the possibility of a technical default on the U.S.? Who stands to gain? Who might be happy to set off this financial bomb?Comments (472)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterInasmuch as I have written many articles about Cory and his relationship, as a Christian, with Judaism, there is no need to recount so many of the tales here that demonstrate what a special person he is. Suffice it so say that the attacks I am reading against him run utterly contrary to the truth.CommentsJenny Dewey RohrichPhotographer, blogger, country girlThere is no denying the fact that our relationship is an adventure. Being married is a feat in and of itself -- being married to a farmer adds a whole other layer.Comments (135)WitnessWITNESS uses video to open the eyes of the world to human rights violations.Forced evictions happen every day, on every continent and yet many of us would likely struggle to define it, even if you\u0027ve actually seen it happen.CommentsJamie CourtAuthor, \u0027The Progressive\u0027s Guide to Raising Hell\u0027; President, Consumer WatchdogPilots, college athletes, bus drivers and Disneyland cast members all are subjected to mandatory drug testing, but not the doctor performing open heart surgery, or a vasectomy. Not yet.Comments (47)Meena KhanLawyer, beauty editor, and yogiJust because yoga teaches us acceptance does not mean that any yogi should have carte blanche to sully a neighbour\u0027s mat with his sweat or to traumatize a fellow yogi with the sight of his flaccid phallus or wet bum.Comments (28)Dean Baker, 2013.10.10Bovey Lee, 2013.10.10Tim Mattingly, 2013.10.10Peter \u0027Souleo\u0027 Wright, 2013.10.10Richard Attias, 2013.10.10Patrick O\u0027Connor, 2013.10.10Dr. Philip Neches, 2013.10.10Travis Nichols, 2013.10.10Barbara Probst Solomon, 2013.10.10National Council of La Raza , 2013.10.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"GOP POLL NIGHTMARE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechnologyYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
