{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, in the wake of reports of air traffic controllers falling asleep on the job, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood announced that controllers will now get an extra hour of sleep between day and night shifts. But he insisted that, unlike their counterparts in Canada and Germany, U.S. controllers would not be allowed to take naps during their scheduled breaks: \"On my watch, controllers will not be paid to take naps.\" No, they\u0027ll be paid to drink coffee, check their emails and grab a smoke. At our offices, we have a pair of napping rooms -- christened Napquest I and Napquest II -- where sleepy editors and reporters can refresh and recharge. Shouldn\u0027t those making sure planes take off and land safely be given the same option? As someone who flies a lot, I much prefer the idea of paid naps than of bleary-eyed, sleep-deprived air traffic controllers. We\u0027ll even save a few slots in our Napquest rooms.Read Post | CommentsSen. Dick Lugar and Sen. Benjamin L.

Thompson, 04.19.2011Former Gov. of Wisconsin and Sec. of the Department of Health and Human ServiceWhen a federal program is growing, the easiest path forward is to continue to cut it. But the problem with Medicare is that it is so complex that if you cut growth in one area, costs are simply shifted to other areas. We must reform and improve it instead.Read Post | CommentsMelinda Gates, 04.18.2011Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationStillbirth is a devastating occurrence for families.
