It is so breathtakingly cynical it should cause us to question whether a candidate that would put it forth is fit for any public office -- let alone the presidency.Read Post | Comments (1,663)George Lakoff, 11/30/11Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics, Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!Just as the Tea Party gained power, the Occupy Movement can.
