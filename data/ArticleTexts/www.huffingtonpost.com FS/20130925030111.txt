{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorSince we\u0027ve never defaulted, we don\u0027t know how much it will cost, with \"cost\" here meaning spending that would be avoided if we didn\u0027t screw around with the debt ceiling. But a few sources Annie Lowrey cites suggest that even flirting with default back in 2011 cost between $1-2 billion due to higher interest rates. You start futzing around with not paying your creditors and -- surprise! -- they insist on adding a risk premium to the interest rate. We have some limited info on the cost of the last big shutdown -- 21 days in late 1995, early 96 -- and those costs were also in the same range: $1-2 billion. So, just thinking about breaching the debt ceiling costs as much as actually shutting down the government.CommentsElizabeth DrewJournalistOnly the members of the electorate can restore the institutions and procedures that make our democratic system work, starting with the next chance they get.Comments (934)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027There are serious complaints about the inadequacy of Obamacare that will have to be addressed in the years ahead.

But the president should ground his opposition to Russia\u0027s antigay law in a more consistent position vis-à-vis countries that criminalize homosexuality.CommentsJay MandleProfessor of Economics, Colgate UniversityWith state and federal incumbents dependent on wealthy donors, it is unrealistic to think that they will pass legislation to reverse economic inequality. Their patrons will look unfavorably upon such initiatives.Comments (25)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe contrast between tea party extremism and populist progressives could not be more telling. Both are based in part on the anger tough times stir up, but these two movements are moving in opposite directions.Comments (73)Nikki Ho-ShingWriter, cookbook hoarder, reality TV enthusiastViewers got more than just hijinks and a pre-Disney Channel Raven-Symoné from The Cosby Show.

And I absolutely love it.Comments (31)Andreas SouvaliotisSocial EntrepreneurI am different. I have always been different. I grew up scared of being found out, scared of my natural inability to fit in, to conform, to look and sound and dress and behave \"normal.\" But then something remarkable happened: one day I was carrying a flag and didn\u0027t even care to count how many were actually following me.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgFar more Americans lack access to affordable dental care than to medical care. This lack of access is not just a problem for those most directly affected. All of us are paying a steep price.Comments (26)Kayley KravitzBoston blogger \u0026 Britpop girlIt seems that every Internet writer over the age of 25 has his or her own list of attained wisdom. Having recently turned a quarter of a century old myself, and coming off of a cross-country move from San Francisco to Boston, I thought I would add my own to the mix.Comments (80)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkAfter a week which began with 12 killed at a Navy Yard shooting in Washington, and continued with 13 shot at a South Side park in Chicago, we still can\u0027t get Congress to pass legislation on background checks.Comments (411)Kate BartolottaOwner and founder, Be You Media GroupKindness costs us nothing and pays exponential dividends. I can\u0027t save the whole world. I can\u0027t bring peace to Syria. I can\u0027t fix the environment or the health care system, and from the looks of it, I may end up burning my dinner.
