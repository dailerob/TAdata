{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe bloody crackdown in Egypt has clarified events. The military staged a coup. The civilian regime created by Gen. Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi was a façade. The secular liberals who hoped to ride into power atop army tanks sold their nation\u0027s future for a mess of pottage. The military\u0027s attempt to destroy the Muslim Brotherhood guarantees a violent future, likely including terrorism and perhaps ending in civil war. Despite having dumped $75 billion worth of \"aid\" into Cairo\u0027s coffers over the years, Washington has no \"leverage.\" Yet the Obama administration continues to mouth meaningless platitudes. President Barack Obama said that the violence \"must stop.\" To make that happen he said the U.S. was pulling out of planned joint military maneuvers with Egypt. No doubt, Gen. al-Sisi will be devastated not to be able to enjoy tea with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel while watching Egyptian soldiers shooting U.S.-made weapons purchased with U.S.-provided dollars.Comments (166)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027Given the excesses of today\u0027s banking institutions, Wall Street and the crony capitalism that is swallowing American initiative and the American dream, the following is a clarion call to our governing class to take heed and to answer the call.Comments (142)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911For Americans concerned about their privacy, the NSA data grabs are daunting, but what about the data grabs happening inside your own home, perpetrated not by the government but by your coffee machine?Comments (263)Arianna HuffingtonThe future will definitely be a hybrid one, combining the best practices of traditional journalism with the best tools available to the digital world. Jeff Bezos has already changed the definition of what retail is; our definition of what constitutes news could use the same level of rethinking.Comments (92)Mark TeixeiraFirst baseman, New York YankeesAfter I caught the final out of the Yankees 27th World Series title, I met my father in the clubhouse and we enjoyed a very emotional embrace, where I thanked him for teaching me to play and love the game of baseball. All children need heroes and role models. All children deserve the opportunity to reach their goals.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWe are now living with an entire generation of disinterested store clerks, rude waiters, indifferent cable company operators and medical office staffs who frankly don\u0027t give a damn whether you ever cross their employer\u0027s doorway again. Does Best Buy really wonder why it\u0027s in bankruptcy? (Hint: Shoppers hate you.)Comments (778)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Comments (1,376)Keli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comIf women are looking to achieve anything close to the myth known as \"having it all,\" the more children they have, the harder it will be. That\u0027s not judgment. That\u0027s simple math.Comments (528)Glennon MeltonBlogger, MomasteryWe have The Talk with each child at the start of every school year. Our approach changes, but the story doesn\u0027t. The story is always about Adam.Comments (50)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAt first, Internet dating sites carried a stigma; they were perceived as ground zero for socially awkward and desperately hopeless souls who could not find love in the \"real world.\"CommentsJosh SugarmannExecutive director, Violence Policy CenterSeeing what a feral hog hunt actually looks like, and knowing that he\u0027s a cheerful promoter as well as participant, Nugent\u0027s \"joke\" about gunning down \"South Central\" residents now has a dark visual resonance.Comments (50)Patricia G. GreeneNational Academic Director, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small BusinessesIt was the first time we had alumni together from each of the programs - and that in itself was cause for celebration. However, the real excitement was about the event and the theme. We were participating in the Aspen Leaders Action Forum and our goal was to learn and share about creating social value through business models.CommentsNida KhanIndependent journalist; Radio correspondent and producerThe amount of taxpayer money spent on these incidents is enough to make anyone\u0027s head spin. It\u0027s simply out of control. And it might be time for the Mayor and Police Commissioner Kelly to accept the reality that police officers need to be retrained and an outside monitor must be established.Comments (248)Caitlin BancroftLegal intern, NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia; Student, The George Washington University Law SchoolI wasn\u0027t considering abortion. I wasn\u0027t considering adoption, or parenting, or childcare. I wasn\u0027t even pregnant, and I definitely wasn\u0027t scared -- at least not at first.Comments (88)Rob BrooksEvolutionary biologist and authorNews just in, guaranteed to stir smug nods from non-believers and incite irritation among the devout: intelligence correlates negatively with religious belief.Comments (1,213)Jana Lee FrazierFormer zookeeper, wildlife biologist and rehabilitatorEverything is so simple when you\u0027ve been sick. To be outside wearing the sun as a shawl when your heart has been so cold for so long is a gift. To think of the ground as a womb and no longer as a grave is a relief.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWe\u0027re becoming a financialized economy. Never before has the manipulation of money counted for so much and the real-world economy of people and consumer goods counted for so little. And none of it is an accident.Comments (18)Eli LehrerPresident, R StreetI\u0027m a conservative and would have voted against Obamacare if I were a member of Congress. I think that many of its provisions are silly and have criticized some of them rather loudly. That said, I\u0027m likely to count myself among the winners as the revised health care system rolls out.Comments (352)Joe CirincionePresident, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Bomb Scare: The History and Future of Nuclear Weapons\u0027Japan wants to build a mile-long, 100-foot deep Ice Wall around the crippled Fukushima nuclear reactors to stop hundreds of gallons of radioactive water from leaking into the Pacific Ocean each day. What could go wrong?Comments (27)Michael BolenHuffPost Canada News EditorThe greatest threat to American national security isn\u0027t a sleeper cell of terrorists or a homegrown militia. It doesn\u0027t have a scary face -- or any face at all. The single biggest danger to America has features that are buried underground, obscured by dense forest, only visible from the air.Comments (119)Audrey ShulmanAvid baker and relentless hostessDoes vanilla work better than chocolate? Is frosting better than glaze? And do more layers of cake mean a higher probability of scoring a date?CommentsNapoleon PerdisMakeup artistI\u0027m a big admirer of iconic fashion photographer Helmut Newton and continue to be drawn to his evocative body of work. I particularly love his depiction of beautiful, hyper-strong women. Despite the S\u0026M overtones, his subjects seem empowered; in control yet fiercely feminine.CommentsSarah ShourdAuthor, Former Hostage and Contributing Editor at Solitary WatchRecognizing the visitation movement\u0027s growing power, ICE began to crack down on three Southern California visitation programs, Friends of Adelanto Detainees and two Orange County programs.CommentsDavid ParkExecutive vice president, mission advancement, America\u0027s Promise AllianceIn the process of giving bone marrow to my dad, I have discovered that we all have the power to change and possibly save a human life. Perhaps our hearts and minds, like fresh new cells, can open up a new world of possibility -- both for the one who receives the gift, and for the one who gives.CommentsKatie AuneAlumni relations \u0026 development professional; Travel writerAt first glance, it may seem close to impossible to save enough money to travel for an extended period of time, but it can be easier than you think if you are willing to make some short-term sacrifices with an eye toward your long-term goal.CommentsHeidi PowellABC\u0027s \u0027Extreme Weight Loss\u0027Let\u0027s be honest: all relationships go through good times and some not-so-good times. Put these four little secrets to the test and see if they can not only keep that spark alive, but help those not-so-good times become better as well. Now that\u0027s a win-win!Comments (12)William HartungDirector, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyStopping aid won\u0027t bring back the dead, or have any impact on the Egyptian military\u0027s behavior in the short-term. But it is the right thing to do, and it could have a longer-term impact.Comments (29)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillCan we please stop talking as if the phrase \"Republican moderate\" has any basis in political reality? Nationally, the GOP has become a party of radicals, proudly wearing on its sleeve its contempt for the less well off and its ignorance of basic scientific reality.Comments (349)Roy Adkins and Lesley AdkinsIt\u0027s an irresistible idea, isn\u0027t it, dressing up as a character from a Jane Austen novel, enjoying a fine dinner, going to the ball, and being swept off your feet by Mr Darcy? (So irresistible an idea, in fact, that it\u0027s pretty much the exact premise of the film \"Austenland\" that comes out this weekend).Comments (25)Gerry SmithTechnology reporter, The Huffington PostIf you\u0027re a light TV viewer who just wants to watch the major networks, Aereo might be right for you.Comments (619)Craig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgReproductive health\u0027s now center-stage in political debates and legislation. Men really can, should, and do play an important role in all of this.Comments (14)Rev.
