{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt\u0027s time for new resolutions backed by urgent and persistent action. In 2013 the United States celebrates the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and of the Birmingham movement. Our first African American president will be inaugurated for a second term, in a public ceremony that will take place the same day as our national holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., our prophet of nonviolence. How will we honor and carry forth our long struggle towards freedom and equality? Let\u0027s resolve not to make this another year of platitudes and remembering the dream, but make this a year of action to end child poverty and violence as Dr. King called for.Read Post | Comments (63)Michael Moore, 01/05/13Oscar and Emmy-winning directorYou might have seen that on Monday President Obama will likely nominate former Sen. Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense. But what you probably haven\u0027t seen -- because everyone has forgotten -- is that back in 2007, Hagel went totally crazy and told the truth about our invasion of Iraq.Read Post | Comments (550)Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, 01/04/13National Spokesperson, Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center; Author, NYT Best-seller \u0027My Stroke of Insight\u0027The issues of mental health and global health are closely linked -- if not one and the same. Similar processes we use to improve our mental health can help us make better, more responsible decisions as a society -- by focusing on the compassion and integrity of our right brain, rather than the judgment, punishment and deception of our left brain.Read Post | Comments (723)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 01/05/13Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIncreasingly dads are showing their daughters how to be strong and effective navigators of their lives much as they have always done with their sons.Read Post | Comments (98)Keith Thomson, 01/05/13Reporter and authorAs you\u0027ll see through the eyes of a serviceman using bath salts, your friends may appear to transform to demons and zombies, you stand to wind up in emergency surgery -- and, possibly, Davy Jones\u0027 Locker.Read Post | Comments (22)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 01/04/13CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe December employment report released this morning confirms that the labor market continues to heal. This is good news. The challenge now is to consolidate the improvement. For that, politicians need to overcome self-made problems; also, and critically, they need to stop creating new ones.Read Post | Comments (138)Gary Hart, 01/04/13President, Hart International, Ltd.Disaster relief, including for Hurricane Sandy, is government spending. It is no worse, but also no better, than meals on wheels for the elderly, school breakfast for poor children, unemployment compensation and rent subsidies. All are government spending and all are \"about human beings.\"Read Post | Comments (202)Marlo Thomas, 01/04/13Award-winning actress, author and activistAs we settle into the new year, it\u0027s a great time to be pro-active and get a jumpstart on spring-cleaning your home. Our friend Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan from Apartment Therapy gave us some great ideas how to clean, re-organize, de-clutter and revamp your home right now.Read Post | Comments (119)Marie Pasinski, M.D., 01/05/13Harvard Neurologist, Brain Health Expert and AuthorRegardless of age, your brain has the ability to make new neurons and construct new neural pathways throughout your life. Exciting research reveals that the way we use our brain and care for our brain can enhance its neuroplasticity.Read Post | CommentsGeoffrey R. Stone, 01/05/13Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThose who want to see more rational gun laws in the United States have to do more than complain about the NRA. We have to ask ourselves: Do we care enough about this issue to DO something about it?Read Post | Comments (637)James Zogby, 01/05/13President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Instead of acting as spectators, enablers, or waiting for the United Nations or the United States to provide solutions, there are practical steps through collective Arab action that might make a real difference.Read Post | Comments (63)Mike Ryan, 01/04/13Senior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostThe first wide-release movie of 2013 is Texas Chainsaw 3D. Billed as a direct sequel to the original Tobe Hooper film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Texas Chainsaw 3D picks up 20 years after the events depicted in that film. With 2012\u0027s Oscar contenders out of the way, that leaves us answering every question that you could have about Texas Chainsaw 3D.Read Post | Comments (116)Rick Hanson, Ph.D., 01/05/13Neuropsychologist; Author, \u0027Just One Thing: Developing a Buddha Brain One Simple Practice at a Time\u0027I was enthralled by Dr. Taylor\u0027s talk when I first saw it, and have thought about it many times since. From the vantage point today of several more years of dramatic growth in neuroscientific knowledge, I\u0027d like to offer three reflections.Read Post | CommentsMark Banschick, MD, 01/03/13Child and adolescent psychiatristWhen it comes to the need for victims to forgive, two questions need to be asked: firstly, do victims really need to forgive to overcome their ordeals? Secondly, is it fair to expect victims to forgive and exonerate their perpetrators?Read Post | Comments (370)Robert Redford, 01/04/13Actor, director and environmental activistThis is a time for climate leadership. So, instead of a shoddy Keystone XL environmental review, the first major climate action for this Administration\u0027s second term should be to set limits on climate change pollution from power plants. That is the kind of action that makes sense.Read Post | Comments (418)Raymond J. Learsy, 01/05/13Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027This torrent of money flowing into OPEC, especially into the Persian Gulf States, raises the question how this massive windfall is being put to use other than providing fresh capital for the world\u0027s largest sovereign wealth funds, as those of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.Read Post | Comments (34)Cherie Blair, 01/04/13Founder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenIn the holiday spirit of peace on Earth and good will toward men, I would argue that more good will toward women, notably in terms of education, would contribute to more peace on Earth.Read Post | Comments (28)Christina Huffington, 01/04/13I would never be that perfect.

Besdine, M.D., 01/05/13For the sake of the 600,000 people who will have a stroke this year, I\u0027d like to offer a short overview of how you can \"make your own luck\" by improving your odds of avoiding a stroke.Read Post | CommentsBob Bragar, 01/04/13Member, Democratic National CommitteeWhile there have been plenty of pre-wedding jitters, heartfelt promises, champagne, cake, and flowers, there has been no white lace on any of these occasions, and no bride either; for I am a gay man, and in all three ceremonies I have married the same wonderful guy.Read Post | Comments (29)David Westin, 01/04/13Author, \u0027Exit Interview\u0027; Former President, ABC NewsThe sale of cable news network Current TV to Al Jazeera has raised more than a few eyebrows. But whatever comes of it all, the creation of this alternative to CNN and Fox News and MSNBC shows just how much has changed in the news media since Peter Jennings left us just seven years ago.Read Post | Comments (38)Patty Brisben, 01/04/13Founder, Pure RomanceNow is the time to stop making excuses for a subpar sex life.

That\u0027s nonsensical. We need to put more money into the pockets of average workers, not less.Read Post | Comments (518)Paula Davis-Laack, 01/03/13Lawyer turned stress \u0026 resilience expertSince graduating with my master\u0027s degree in positive psychology, I\u0027ve worked with and observed thousands of people in a wide variety of settings, and happy people just flow with the groove of life in a unique way.
