{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington PostTaking in our tumultuous times, it\u0027s clear that something is wrong. There is no mistaking that the way we\u0027re working isn\u0027t working. Figuring out why this is so -- and what we can do about it -- is the animating idea behind The Way We\u0027re Working Isn\u0027t Working, this month\u0027s HuffPost Book Club selection. It is essential reading for anyone who wants a more productive and meaningful life. The book\u0027s thesis is that a myth has taken hold that \"human beings operate most productively in the same one-dimensional way computers do: continuously, at high speeds, for long periods of time.\" Yet the most basic human survival need is to renew our energy. We\u0027re great at spending it, not so great at renewing it. The inevitable result: diminished judgment and wisdom -- and a world on the brink of collapse. \"More and more,\" posits the book, \"paradoxically, leads to less and less.\"Read Post | CommentsAaron Sorkin, 05.12.2010Playwright, screenwriter and television writerWith all due respect to Kristin Chenoweth and all the Internet posters who\u0027ve crashed down on the theater critic who claimed that gay actors can\u0027t and shouldn\u0027t play straight characters, I don\u0027t think the critic was being homophobic. Just wrong.Read Post | CommentsJohn Kerry, 05.12.2010U.S. Senator from MassachusettsThe proposal I\u0027m rolling out today with Sen. Lieberman, major energy and comprehensive climate change legislation, will create nearly 2 million new jobs and support the research and development to help us maintain leadership.Read Post | CommentsMichael Smerconish, 05.12.2010Elected officials spend only as much time together as is absolutely necessary. And they only see each other in a single context: the ugly political and ideological clashes that end up dominating the daily talk radio shows.Read Post | CommentsLauren Ashburn, 05.12.2010For the first time in history, three women could sit on the Supreme Court. There\u0027s a subtle, yet powerful, message being sent to working women across the nation: If you want a perch at the pinnacle of your profession, it\u0027s easier without kids.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 05.12.2010Editor of Eat The PressOne of the weirder qualities attributed to Elena Kagan is the widespread belief that she somehow will be able to reliably \"persuade\" perennial swing-vote Justice Kennedy. Is she some kind of mentalist?Read Post | CommentsRandall L. Kennedy, 05.12.2010Michael R. Klein Professor of Law, Harvard Law SchoolThere has been some grousing in the media about the paucity of racial minorities hired during Kagan\u0027s Deanship.

How often is there a sole survivor?Read Post | CommentsDan Abrams, 05.12.2010Founder/Publisher, mediaite.comThe mere specks of spongy legal dirt from Elena Kagan\u0027s past do not exactly offer the fleshy and easily understandable outrage that serves as the media\u0027s lifeblood.Read Post | CommentsFortune\u0027s Stanley Bing, 05.12.2010Fortune Magazine ColumnistWith the market zooming up and down like a demented bobbin, people who have money are looking for places to put it. As a public service, I inform them of some good places.Read Post | CommentsFrances Beinecke, 05.12.2010President, Natural Resources Defense CouncilSens. Kerry and Lieberman have done a remarkable job of building the foundation for clean energy and climate action. But to realize the promise of the bill, we need leadership from the top.Read Post | CommentsTony Blankley, 05.12.2010Winning a majority of Republicans in November without electing a majority for radical, immediate rollback will be essentially as good as losing.Read Post | CommentsHenry Blodget, 05.12.2010CEO of The Business InsiderFrom a financial perspective, Google is still a one-product company (search). But now, in the biggest and most important market on earth (responsible for almost half of Google\u0027s revenue), Google\u0027s share gains have flatlined.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 05.12.2010Consultant, Writer, Policy AnalystHere\u0027s the truth, for all those well-meaning payday defenders out there: Payday loans weren\u0027t created to help underserved populations, but to exploit helpless people.Read Post | CommentsZach Carter, 05.12.2010Economics Editor, AlterNet; Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThere are two consumer protection amendments getting serious attention on the Senate floor this week, one of them positive, one of them incredibly destructive -- the kind of amendment that can actually sink the bill if adopted.Read Post | CommentsRep. Alan Grayson, 05.11.2010Congressman Alan Grayson represents Central Florida (FL-8).The Fed has not been chastened. It is more of a rogue actor than ever.

James Martin, S.J., 05.12.2010Catholic priest and author of The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) EverythingYesterday Pope Benedict XVI called sexual abuse \"truly terrifying.\" In his frank comments to reporters, he seemed to rebut Vatican curial officials who have sought to portray the crisis as somehow generated from the outside.Read Post | CommentsDavid Swanson, 05.12.2010Isn\u0027t it time to call what Congress will soon vote on by its right name: war escalation funding?Read Post | CommentsSec.
