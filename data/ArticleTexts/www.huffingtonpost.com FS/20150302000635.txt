{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week demonstrated the power of shared experiences and having some collective fun -- i.e. virality. It began with social media all atwitter over Patricia Arquette\u0027s Oscar speech -- and backstage comments. Next up, the Internet was riveted by The Great Llama Chase -- as the camelids, part of a therapy visit (Emotional Support Llamas?), made a break for it during a bathroom break. Later that same day, the most viral #dress in history had everyone debating: white and gold, or blue and black? If you saw polka dots you should probably see a doctor. The episode culminated with a national teach-in about color and optics. The week ended on a sad note, with the passing of Leonard Nimoy, never wiser than in his Spock-worthy final tweet: \"A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP.\" He lived long, and we all prospered from it.Despite some progress over the past few years, gender-based legal restrictions remain significant.

In trying to figure out how to overcome evil, it is often helpful to first decide how not to.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersPerhaps more than any other group, athletes have fully embraced sleep as a performance enhancement tool. Top athletes are, of course, all about results. So there\u0027s no better place than the world of sports to see the tangible effects of sleep (including pre-game naps) on performance.No, climate change is not experiencing a hiatus. No, there is not currently a \"pause\" in global warming.

But more importantly, Mr. Fahmy should not be subjected to this process at all.LawyerThis is what democracy looks like. That\u0027s not something I thought I\u0027d ever say about the bureaucrats at the Federal Communications Commission.

We were taught that learning all we can about a specific profession is the key to moving up to our goal rung on the socioeconomic ladder. Even \"digital natives\" learned this flawed premise; like the generations before them, they still think that hard skills are the key to advancement.Author, Speaker, EntrepreneurI strongly agree with both the prime minister of Israel and the president of the United States that Iran can never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon. That is why I feel particularly anguished that the ill-advised invitation from House Speaker Boehner has managed to threaten, in my view, both the security of Israel and the historic bipartisan support in the Congress.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtThere is a government role in combating sex trafficking and the abusers -- but what about the victims? These women are broken physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They need healing in all areas and Christian-based programs have proven to be successful over and over. I will continue to be a voice for these victims.U.S. Senator from KentuckyKYIV -- What happens in Ukraine -- not the financial standoff with Greece -- will be the ultimate test of whether European and transatlantic unity endure. The fault lines extending from Ukraine are undermining the fundamental values that have underpinned Europe\u0027s postwar peace and prosperity. Failure to defend those values in Ukraine will cause them to unravel far beyond our borders.Fmr. prime minister of Ukraine; Current leader of All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" (\"Batkivshchyna\")It\u0027s no secret I consider income inequality the greatest challenge of our time.

Rather, poverty is something people fall into by their own failures, and it is also something that they can leave behind by climbing the ladder of success.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsJust weeks ago, the Washington Post described Scott Walker as the first \"It\" candidate of the 2016 presidential races, but after stumbling over \"truth,\" evolution, and whether or not the President is a Christian or loves America, Walker is getting ready to change the topic.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedLearn about your dog\u0027s limits physically, take the heat into consideration, and have a time limit for your hike.

The order puts undue pressure on the judges to get their cases over with so they can get back home, they insisted.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstAmerica has vilified Brian Williams for lying and NBC suspended him for six months. Bill O\u0027Reilly was not in a war zone and wasn\u0027t in a combat situation. Can anyone explain how O\u0027Reilly is better, or more deserving of leniency than Brian Williams?Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsSo my prayer today is this. That I stop defining myself by my doing, and start defining myself by my being.

And that I stop seeing my life as \"busy,\" and instead, see it for what it truly is.
