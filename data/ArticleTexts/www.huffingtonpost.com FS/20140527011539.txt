{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonLONDON -- \"The English are not very spiritual people,\" goes the quote, often attributed to George Bernard Shaw, \"so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.\" Having arrived in London for the UK publication of Thrive, I can happily say that, when it comes to matters of the soul, the British have evolved quite a bit since Shaw\u0027s quip. And what I\u0027ve found so far is that the renowned stiff upper lip is softening. On the one hand, this country, known for its proud independence and zealous maintenance of very old traditions, is no stranger to all the ills and afflictions that come with our modern, tech-driven, and decidedly broken definition of success. On the other hand, in many ways, Brits have surpassed their Yankee younger sibling both in terms of realizing the extent of the problems they face and in moving to institutionalize and scale up the obvious solutions. Perhaps this is no surprise, since many of these solutions are themselves products of ancient wisdom that have since been unambiguously validated and confirmed by science.The story that troubles me is what occurred under America\u0027s first African-American president, in our own time. I refer to the preventable catastrophe of the wipe-out of black home equity.Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Neighborhoods no longer serve as Americans\u0027 primary social networks or source of friends and advisers. More and more, these aspects of life are becoming part of the workplace; offices have even been called the new neighborhood.Ruth Bettelheim, Ph.D.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachFor so many people, Memorial Day is about the start of summer, family cookouts and trips to the beach. And while all those things celebrate the freedoms we all enjoy as Americans, for the families of our fallen troops Memorial Day is deeply personal.Bonnie CarrollFounder and President, Tragedy Assistance Program for SurvivorsLet\u0027s hope that the continuing string of Pharma outrages and scandals provokes a righteous and effective backlash. We are fighting the wrong war on drugs. Containing Pharma should be our number one public health priority.Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityBrown failed me. Now, I want to make sure that it doesn\u0027t fail the next generation of students.Lena ScloveWriter and social justice activistThe nation\u0027s Memorial Day observations were divided. In the North, the federal government created national cemeteries for men who died in the war, while state governments from New York to Michigan gradually made Decoration Day an official holiday throughout the 1870s.Jim DownsAssociate Professor of History and American Studies, Connecticut CollegePope Francis has shown us a faithful, peaceful approach to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. All of us can follow his example. We are all Pope Francis now. It is up to all of us.Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington Post\"Foster care is not fun for anyone,\" says 24-year-old law student Amy Peters, who entered Nebraska\u0027s foster care system at age 12 and remained until she \"aged out\" at 19. Fortunately for Amy, she excelled in high school and was accepted at the University of Nebraska.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFed Up is an excellent documentary; it\u0027s the latest in shocking truths about our food in America from Atlas Films with producers Katie Couric, Laurie David, Heather Reisman, Regina Kulik Scully and Michael Walrath, directed by Stephanie Soechtig.Dr. Reese HalterBroadcaster, Conservation Biologist, EducatorMy extended family, all naturalized American citizens, are among the 17 million people in the U.S. living in mixed-status immigrant households where at least one person is undocumented.

And of course, as far as I\u0027m concerned, a lot more parades.Michael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.What is it that makes two minds respond so differently to the same encounter with misfortune?Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027In any other profession, professionals are not retaliated against if they speak out about issues in their respective fields.Franchesca WarrenFor us to learn anything from this tragedy we have to wrench ourselves away from his manifesto -- it\u0027s not about him anymore. Leave him to his fate in eternity, and wish solace on everyone.David Palumbo-LiuLouise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityThe elections are an opportunity for all Ukrainians across the country to come together, exercise their right to vote and express their commitment to a better future together.Mark BrzezinskiU.S. Ambassador to SwedenFor 150 years, since the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in Confederate states, we have relied upon the conveniences of selective memory and mythmaking to imagine a more united, United States.Jennifer WheelerFounder, political blog \u0027The Nakedist\u0027I am utterly convinced that if every single parent paid attention to their children to the greatest degree possible, with no limitations or planned obsolescence, we would not be having as many of these dreaded conversations.Lorraine Devon WilkeSass \u0026 SensibilityI have never had doubts about the courage of the young men and women we sent overseas wearing the uniform. I have never had doubts about the pain caused to those in the military as they lay dying in foreign fields.Letitia JamesNew York City Public AdvocateThe 1960s folk music scene was a chapter in a long story, one that began decades earlier and that continues today as a new generation of singers and songwriters connect -- directly and indirectly -- to the burgeoning progressive movements that are rippling across the country.Peter DreierDick FlacksWhile I\u0027m glad that obsessive-compulsive disorder has emerged in our cultural consciousness and that some realistic depictions of it are being depicted in mass media, it\u0027s extremely annoying how often I hear people claim that they are sooooo OCD over some tiny little quirk.BustleNews, entertainment, lifestyle siteMuch of modern physics has been about exploring inherently invisible things, which seem to be far more common than the obvious things we experience with our senses. Yet these invisible things follow rigorous laws that allow us to test their existence in many ways. Here is a very short list of some of the \"invisible\" things that we routinely work with.Dr. Sten OdenwaldAstronomer, National Institute of AerospaceThe weather is beyond our control, so don\u0027t fret about it too much. Instead, focus on what you can do to make it work in your favor. In adverse conditions, a little planning goes a long way.Jason SaltmarshCompetitive masters runnerCould the newest \"shot heard \u0027round the world\" be the lethal injection of Oklahoma death-row inmate Clayton Lockett? After all, his 45-minute death struggle has been denounced by the UN and will likely have a profound impact on the nature of capital punishment in the United States.Adam BannerCriminal Defense AttorneyIn many ways, the upcoming Egyptian presidential elections, which will take place on May 26-27, are an object lesson in how to fix an election while presenting a façade that everything is free and fair.Neil HicksInternational Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstThe call of today\u0027s anti-gay Christians is \"Stop calling us bigots, everyone! Just because we believe what the Bible says about homosexuality does not make us bigots!\" So let\u0027s think about that.John ShoreFounder, NALT Christians ProjectFor some kids, education means a chance at a life that is not 14 hours a day of backbreaking labor, risking lives to leave families and toil as migrant laborers across the treacherous border; it means hope for a better future.Michaela Kennedy-CuomoGranddaughter of Robert F. KennedyThere are good initiatives, such as Toronto\u0027s MARS, to help overcome this. And some programs for government support exist -- but they are feeble compared to what\u0027s needed.
