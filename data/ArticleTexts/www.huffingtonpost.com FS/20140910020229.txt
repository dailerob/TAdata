It has been highly successful. There is every reason to expect it to persist as long as the US provides the necessary military, economic, diplomatic, and ideological support.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyIt\u0027s possible that, underneath it all, though, we stay because our brains are wired wrong. I know I was addicted to the oxytocin produced by having a man in my life -- no matter how awful a man.Film and TV writer and producer; author, \u0027Love Addict: Sex, Romance and Other Dangerous Drugs\u0027As I watch the woman seizing in front of me though, I do not feel helplessness, but shame.

Can you be angry about Ray Rice and the NFL\u0027s inadequate handling of him but still feel okay about watching the game? The answer, to both, is no.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarI don\u0027t think Governor Cuomo\u0027s refusal to debate Zephyr Teachout is really about sexism. It\u0027s about money-ism. In this democracy, not to have money is not to be qualified.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersThe temple was huge and packed and silent and all her fancy friends were there, as well as many of us girl comics, because we had lost our dear leader (I do see her as my own personal Kim Jong Ill, as she was tiny yet commanded an empire) and so it was our saddest day.Comedian, actor and recording artistIf you don\u0027t understand how Ray Rice was allowed to initially escape prosecution, accepting a much lesser punishment of therapy from the court, nothing illustrates the culture of protecting the abusers of women better than Republican Ben Carson\u0027s statement on behalf of Ray Rice.Author, political writer, relationship expert.If Westboro does show up in front of our offices to protest, we\u0027ll be ready for them. We\u0027re not scared of a handful of sad people with access to school supplies and a few nasty slogans.Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesAmid the degeneration and loss of freedom and wellbeing of millions, an ember of civility and civilization in the form of a video entitled \"The Greek Secret\" has emerged.

Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn this season between anniversaries from Brown v.

That\u0027s how long it would it take to hold a House vote if Speaker Boehner would just bring up the bipartisan Senate immigration reform bill that passed over a year ago.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaDirty money in politics has enabled the fossil fuel industries to dirty our air and endanger our planet. With clean elections, we will, finally, drive forward the clean energy revolution.President, Public CitizenExecutive Director, Greenpeace USUnless we reduce skyrocketing wealth and income inequality, unless we end the ability of the super-rich to buy elections, the United States will be well on its way toward becoming an oligarchic form of society where almost all power rests with the billionaire class.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontRoughly 53 percent of Indian households, still use public streets and fields as bathrooms.

Not totally -- I\u0027m not the slickest person on the planet, and I\u0027ve been known to leave behind chocolate-coated fingerprints and cookie crumbs in my wake -- but well enough.Aspiring writer and the author of PaladinIt seems that we can only count on the National Football League and it\u0027s teams to do the right thing when there are no more lies to hide behind. The money they make and the appearances that they try so hard to keep up are their main focus.Stay-at-home dad and author, Life Is Short, Laundry Is Eternal: Confessions of a Stay-At-Home DadI have spent the last few months really digging into all sorts of cereals, expanding my milk-soaked palate to include Whole Foods specialties, little weird boxes of fancy cereal from England and Switzerland, and even Wheat Chex.
