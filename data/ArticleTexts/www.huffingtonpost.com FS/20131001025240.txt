{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The great shutdown drama of 2013 should be a slam-dunk win for Democrats. The Republican extremism grows nuttier and more unrealistic by the day. The one other time Republicans tried this stunt, under House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1995-96, Republicans got their clocks cleaned by President Clinton. Government reopened, and Clinton did not give away the store. And not until the arrival of Tea Party control of the House in 2011 did any party try to make legislative or ideological gains by threating to repudiate America\u0027s national debt. This time, however, Republicans have sown just enough confusion that they may suffer only temporary losses in their popularity in exchange for legislative gains.Comments (124)Charles FergusonDirector, Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027; Author, \u0027Predator Nation\u0027I\u0027m cancelling my documentary about Hillary Clinton. It\u0027s a victory for the Clintons, and for the money machines that both political parties have now become. But I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s a victory for the media, or for the American people.Comments (948)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Giving in to bullies just encourages them to escalate their demands.The president gave in at the end of 2011 when Republican bullies threatened to go over the fiscal cliff and take the rest of the nation with them.Comments (715)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranWe know who will be impacted by a shutdown by Republicans, and we know it will be bad. The degree to which it will be bad is what is up in the air. When it comes to troops and veterans, much of that holds true.CommentsMaureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostI wasn\u0027t expecting another \"Ozymandias,\" but the slightly mechanical \"Felina\" wasn\u0027t quite what I was expecting.Comments (1,767)Michelle ObamaFirst Lady of The United StatesThere\u0027s nothing more important than knowing that our families are healthy and happy. And after spending so much time with military families and hearing your stories of service and sacrifice for our country, I know that that\u0027s your priority as well.Comments (33)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgI\u0027ve often said that the Affordable Care Act is the end of the beginning of reform. Starting tomorrow, October 1, 2014, that law will signify the beginning of the end of the health insurance industry as we know it.Comments (246)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIt is not often that a daily newspaper is able, in just one edition, to capture so many previously-unlikely domestic developments. Yet Sunday\u0027s Washington Post comes very close.Comments (16)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We have been repeatedly warned that the dollar could lose its status as the world\u0027s reserve currency in the event of default. While this is a dubious claim (will countries rush to the euro?), it would actually be good news if it were true.CommentsTom TarantinoChief Policy Officer, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaWhile veterans may be more protected than other constituencies, a government shutdown does not bode well for top priorities within the veterans\u0027 community.CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolThe Kochs\u0027 sabotage is shrewder than defunding Obamacare because it goes to the whole basis for the Affordable Care Act\u0027s plan to cover the uninsured: the creation of a risk pool that includes the young and healthy as well as the not young and not immortal.Comments (16)Joy Martin-MaloneMother, writer, designer and reconstruction extraordinaireImagine my horror when my toddlers took to Disney princesses. The feminist inside me wept -- until, eavesdropping on their usual princess gab, I overheard the following statement: \"My favorite princess is Ariel, and yours is Cinderella, and Mommy\u0027s favorite princess is Sharon Needles.\"Comments (215)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (106)Rep. Diana DeGetteChief Deputy WhipThe compounding drug bill that passed Saturday in the midst of this morass can act as a model for how we can hammer out a difficult compromise on an important issue. It proved that even in the fall of 2013, compromise in Congress is indeed possible.Comments (12)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWe\u0027ve observed misinformation and fear mongering against the president\u0027s Affordable Care Act, also referred to as \u0027Obamacare\u0027. But guess what, it\u0027s going into effect tomorrow.Comments (31)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe House actually pinged two bills back to the Senate: one that conditions funding the government on defunding the health care law, and the other that exempts military pay from the shutdown. I suspect the Senate will unanimously approve the latter. The former will lead to the shutdown.Comments (12)Jeff FauxFounder and now Distinguished Fellow at the Economic Policy InstituteThe point is not that the British, or Canadian or any other system is necessarily the exactly right model for the U.S. But we will never get anywhere near the right model unless the ideological fog that clouds our political discourse on health care is lifted.Comments (522)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersBefore taking office, each member of Congress swears a simple, straightforward oath. It leaves little room for misinterpretation. They vow to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and to \"faithfully discharge the duties of the office.\" High among those duties is paying the government\u0027s bills.Comments (731)Norman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027To the people in control of the Executive Branch, violating our civil liberties is an essential government service. So -- to ensure total fulfillment of Big Brother\u0027s vast responsibilities -- the National Security Agency is insulated from any fiscal disruption.Comments (27)Jay MichaelsonAuthor, \u0027Evolving Dharma: Meditation, Buddhism, and the Next Generation of Enlightenment\u0027You may not know the name of S.N. Goenka, who died Saturday at the age of 90. But if you\u0027ve counted your breaths to relax in a hospital, or if you\u0027ve ever tried to eat, walk, or speak \"mindfully,\" you\u0027ve felt his influence.Comments (28)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundJaime, Katie, and La\u0027Mont are three young servant leaders whose stories we are celebrating as part of our 40th anniversary celebration. They are a reminder that we must never ever give up on any child.Comments (18)Lena OhWriterI\u0027ve witnessed too many ironies in my life and have gone through painful experiences. Despite learning from these mistakes, I wish I could tell my young self what I know now. And if some genius happens to create a time machine in my lifetime, these are the things that I\u0027d say.Comments (18)Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyWhat the richest parents want for their children is what the poorest parents want for theirs. Measure their aspiration, however, against the fact that more than 21 million Americans are still in need of full time work, many of them running out of jobless benefits.Comments (17)Dilip HiroAuthor, \u0027Apocalyptic Realm: Jihadists in South Asia\u0027Ever fewer countries, allies, or enemies, are paying attention, much less kowtowing, to the once-formidable power of the world\u0027s last superpower. The list of defiant figures -- from Egyptian generals to Saudi princes, Iraqi Shiite leaders to Israeli politicians -- is lengthening.Comments (35)Robert WalkerPresident, Population InstituteI have fought in the trenches on issues as contentious as gun control and campaign finance reform, but I have never seen anything quite like this. This is visceral. And, quite frankly, it frightens me.Comments (22)Marlene PearceDoctor, bloggerThe latest crop of hard-working professionals like bankers, lawyers and doctors, are all Gen Y now. Like it or not, we\u0027re putting our unique Gen Y stamp on our professions. (We\u0027re pretty confident we can do a better job than you, anyway.)Comments (12)Sen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkWe know the American workforce is changing at a rapid pace as families rely more and more on women\u0027s income to get by. But, as the face of the American workplace has changed, the federal rules that govern it have not kept up.Comments (277)Sen. Ed MarkeySenator Edward J. Markey of MassachusettsLike any budget, the carbon budget is finite. At our current pace, we have about 15 years left before we\u0027d have to stop burning fossil fuels altogether to avoid dangerous consequences.Comments (28)Brian GreeneFounder and president, Blue Greene EnterprisesWhy do we care to pay so much attention to players on the field, but so little when they are forced to leave their stage? No one can explain or justify the action Paul took, but it does beg the question, \"what more can be done?\"CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn Italy what Barilla said is, sadly, too often perfectly acceptable. He was speaking on an Italian radio program. He was likely not very conscious of how the rights and conditions of LGBT people, and the role of women, have changed dramatically in the rest of the industrialized West.Comments (966)Robin WilkeyEditor, The Huffington Post San FranciscoA reporter once wrote that sports train us for the heartbreaks of real life without imposing any actual consequences. That\u0027s the beauty of the game: there\u0027s always next year. But there is no next year for Jonathan Denver. And this is what\u0027s robbing sports of everything good.Comments (57)Stephanie Michele, 2013.30.09Stephen Henrick, 2013.30.09Evan Manning, 2013.30.09Scott Alexander Hess, 2013.30.09Dean Baker, 2013.30.09Adam Grant, 2013.30.09Perry Brass, 2013.30.09Steve Mariotti, 2013.30.09Gary A.
