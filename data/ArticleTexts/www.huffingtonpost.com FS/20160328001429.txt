{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the world was horrified by the bombings in Brussels, which left dozens dead and hundreds injured. The attacks highlighted the seriousness and complexity of the threat facing both Europe and the U.S. Tough talk about refugees and closing borders isn\u0027t going to do it. And yet Ted Cruz, just before turning his attention to fighting with Donald Trump about their wives, suggested we \"empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.\" As if that\u0027s not a recipe for radicalization. Meanwhile, Jeb Bush endorsed Cruz to \"overcome\" the \"vulgarity Donald Trump has brought into the political arena.\" But as low as the rhetoric on the Republican side has gone, what\u0027s become standard policy dogma - indiscriminate bombing, deporting 12 million people, and revoking health insurance from millions more - is much more vulgar. The threats and challenges we face require real leaders, not pandering priapic preening and the same empty macho drivel that has led to so many of our present crises.It\u0027s been 24 years since I wrote, \"Men and women are clearly measured by a different yardstick...

But sometimes the most important changes begin with the smallest step.44th President of the United States\"Sleep, grades, social life: pick two.\" This motto, or some version of it, can be heard on college campuses across the country -- it\u0027s yet more evidence, as if we needed any, that college students today feel as if they\u0027re in a no-win situation, forced to choose between sleep and life. That\u0027s a choice nobody should ever have to make.We must denounce American political leaders who also speak and act to politicize this terrorist violence, as the terrorists do, in service of their own political agendas and ambitions. In particular, we should denounce the words of Ted Cruz, who is calling for the \"patrolling\" of Muslim neighborhoods in the United States and putting Muslim American citizens under surveillance.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersChanneling Michel de Montaigne, when Trump says, \"I think you\u0027d have riots,\" he can claim (and does claim) that he is merely making a prediction, but his target audiences -- his detractors and his supporters -- will hear the prediction as a threat and an invitation respectively.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolYour article on Bernie Sanders came as such a surprise to me -- that the same woman who has made it her life\u0027s mission to speak the truth and shed light on corruption, lies, and false narratives created by the corporate elite and special interest groups, would now suddenly create a narrative that distorts facts and misguides American voters.Actress; Co-founder, Voto LatinoHave we passed a point of no return, is ice melt sure to increase so that AMOC shutdown is a foregone conclusion? I doubt it, but it\u0027s conceivable, depending on how fast we slow down human-made climate forcing. I think the conclusion is clear. We are in a position of potentially causing irreparable harm to our children, grandchildren and future generations.Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteThe Human Rights Campaign doesn\u0027t speak for the LGBT community, and the sooner that politicians and those in the media grasp that, the smarter they will be.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThe North Carolina law not only codifies discrimination into law, it teaches and validates hate.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusCo-founder and Board President, Harvey Milk Foundation; nephew of Harvey MilkCan you imagine being hated whether or not you do apologize? This is what being a Muslim in America today feels like.Palestinian-American Muslim. Student. Humanitarian.The Republican Party has become intellectually and morally bankrupt, a mockery of its traditions -- corrosive to our society, our civility, and our capacity to govern. This is not a temporary condition; it is woven into the fabric of the party. Unless and until it reverses course, you should take your votes and money and walk away.Novelist and contributing opinion writerPerhaps a further distinction should be made between literary works that impart meaning to war and those that face the fact that, of all human experiences, war is one of the most thoroughly senseless.French philosopher and writerGarry Shandling: Always funny -- always spot-on. I have no adequate words to express the huge sorrow I feel on the passing of Garry.British-born, Hollywood-based humorist, commentator, producer and radio hostEach year, more than 600,000 individuals return to our neighborhoods after serving time in federal and state prisons, and another 11.4 million individuals cycle through local jails.83rd Attorney General of the United StatesI encourage all of my friends, especially those still in North Carolina, to use your voices, platforms and anger to speak out about the impact of this bill on the lives of queer, trans and gender-nonconforming people navigating social and political life in the state -- and outside of it, too.HuffPost Queer Voices Deputy EditorBernie Sanders has tied or beaten Hillary Clinton in a majority of the actively contested votes this election season.

It could very well have been, had Manning decided to call it a day.Contributor, NowItCounts.comThere are many things parents go through with their children, but the horrors of potty training can be truly traumatizing.Sarcasm lover, thought enthusiast, passionate humanThere are two Democrats whose resignation from office right now would do their party and country a service.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAlthough there are liberals who are disappointed that President Obama did not nominate someone more in the spirit of a William Brennan or a Thurgood Marshall, Merrick Garland is an exceptional choice. But Senate Republicans, led by the likes of Mitch McConnell and Charles Grassley, refuse even to consider his nomination.Edward H.

But while it\u0027s important to acknowledge the uphill battle ahead, it\u0027s also important to look back on how far we\u0027ve climbed since the Ghomeshi scandal first broke in 2014. In the span of two years, this case has shifted public opinion towards believing victims, which is a victory in itself.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostSaudi Arabia\u0027s pathetic effort to convince the American public that it is a force for tolerance and stability in the world continued in a laughable op-ed published on this site just over a week ago.9/11 ActivistAdvisory Board Member, National Air Disaster Alliance/Foundation; Board Member and Founder, Housing Our Nation’s Outstanding Returning ServicemenProfessor in Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Albert Einstein College of MedicineGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
