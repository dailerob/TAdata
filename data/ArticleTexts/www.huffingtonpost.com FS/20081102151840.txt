Many usual suspects are opining in the cable universe, so for a cerebral alternative there\u0027s \"A Fateful Election\" in the Nov. 6 New York Review of Books.Read Post | CommentsBIOBertha Lewis, 10.31.2008We want to assure you that partisan attacks will not interfere with ACORN members\u0027 determination to involve low-income, minority, and new American voters across the country.Read Post | CommentsBIORobert Kubey, 11.02.2008The critical point is that it is easier to scare undecideds than uplift and inspire these same voters. The psychobiological study of fear demonstrates this.Read Post | Comments (15)BIOJohann Hari, 11.02.2008We can already map out the four tectonic shifts rumbling beneath this election. They all began before Obama -- but his cool stride has brought them into history sooner than many of us thought possible.Read Post | Comments (38)BIODaniel Sinker, 11.02.2008With Obama, it\u0027s not possible to fight the Vietnam war all over again. It\u0027s simply not his war.Read Post | CommentsBIOJaron Lanier, 11.01.2008I want to live in a world in which bankers get rich by pushing every neuron in their brains to find great investments in the real world instead of illusory sure bets in a phony world.Read Post | CommentsBIOBruce Wilson, 11.02.2008Mounting evidence suggests Palin is deeply involved with a global religious movement bent on imposing theocracies around the world -- the leaders appear to have made anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish statements.Read Post | Comments (47)BIOJohn Zogby, 11.02.2008Our next president must find a new way to succeed, to make the politics of Washington work so that the government can again be a catalyst for good, not an obstacle in the way.Read Post | CommentsMichael Shaw, 11.02.2008Christine Pelosi, 11.01.2008Fred Goldring, 11.02.2008Carl Bernstein, 11.01.2008Jerry Brown, 11.02.2008Joseph Nye, 11.02.2008Jason Linkins, 11.02.2008Robert Kubey, 11.02.2008David Margolick, 11.01.2008Linda Bergthold, 11.01.2008Marc Cooper, 11.01.2008Lynn Forester de Rothschild, 11.01.2008Rep.
