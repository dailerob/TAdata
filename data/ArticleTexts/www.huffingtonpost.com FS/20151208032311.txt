{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Earlier today, the candidate currently leading in the polls for the Republican presidential nomination called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" That was, of course, Donald Trump. On the heels of Trump\u0027s proposed change for America, we will be changing how we cover him at The Huffington Post. Back in July, we announced our decision to put our coverage of Trump\u0027s presidential campaign in our Entertainment section instead of our Politics section. \"Our reason is simple,\" wrote Ryan Grim and Danny Shea. \"Trump\u0027s campaign is a sideshow.\" Since then Trump\u0027s campaign has certainly lived up to that billing. But as today\u0027s vicious pronouncement makes abundantly clear, it\u0027s also morphed into something else: an ugly and dangerous force in American politics. We believe that the way we cover the campaign should reflect this shift. And part of that involves never failing to remind our audience who Trump is, and what his campaign really represents.The loss of confidence in government, fostered by many in government, is a more serious threat to American security than ISIS. There is no American alive today who can destroy confidence in our government and expect to restore it by being elected.United States Senator (Ret.)How much more evidence do we need that our system is in crisis? How long before we make it work for all of us instead of a handful at the top? We must not let them buy our democracy. We must get big money out of politics.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027On Sunday, France\u0027s worst side won the first round. It must not win the second. This coming Sunday, will the Front National, a despicable party led by a nepotistic clique replete with ex-cons pining for the good old days of wedge politics, gain control of entire regions of the country?Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.in Trump\u0027s campaign, a new kind of unapologetic brutality is coming to the home front. It has the logic and the emotional tenor of war: friend and enemy, unconditional force, lining up in solidarity behind a strong man who will lead us.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027I am not convinced that, contrary to the enthusiastic claims of Florian Philippot, the Front National vote was a \"vote of love.\" At least, let\u0027s hope it isn\u0027t the case! But it is, at the very least, a vote of fear.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostOut of all the poets who received the Pulitzer, 38 percent of them were bipolar. How can we simply label it a human disorder? Think how much more they could contribute to the human spirit if they knew it could be used as a gift to humanity, instead of something to hide from humanity?Filmmaker, \u0027Touched with Fire\u0027The 2015 Global Thought Leaders Index, a \"collective intelligence\" analysis that maps the global conversation on the Internet and ranks its most influential voices, has just been released by The WorldPost and the Zurich-based Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute.Editor-in-chief, THEWORLDPOSTDear Father Christmas, So my friend has asked me to write to you... I have to confess it\u0027s been hard to know what to say. Mainly because like most adults I feel preposterous asking anything of you because our time with you is surely done.ActorWe will probably never be able to solve the gun issue in America, and we will continue to kill one another with a greater frequency than any civilized nation on Earth. We have a law, our second amendment right, so goes the cry. If people get shot to death, so be it. After all, we must obey and respect that amendment, that\u0027s what we hear over and over again.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerWhen terrorism hits a place like this, it desecrates the very heart of America. And Americans deserve a clear comprehensive plan to eradicate terror from our shores. Instead we got a partial plan, mostly recycled and a wish list, from the president.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityGiven that even micro gun control measures will be effectively blocked by the NRA and its allies, and that promoting mini measures as potentially effective is misleading, progressives may as well go for the big enchilada: Call for domestic disarmament.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe venerable George Shultz, Ronald Reagan\u0027s Secretary of State, and arguably one of the most distinguished public servants in post-­World War II America, uses \"mugged by reality\" to describe what he thinks of the current crop of presidential candidates in his beloved Republican Party refusing to believe in the reality of global climate change.President, News and Guts MediaAs Puerto Rico\u0027s financial crisis deepens, so will its impact on the most vulnerable populations, including the poor, seniors and the chronically ill. Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico deserve the right to access healthcare.The largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the United StatesMaybe one day we will have to worry about robots taking our jobs, but right now we have to worry about the Fed taking jobs. If would be nice if those wringing their hands over the threat to jobs posed by robots could take a few minutes to be concerned about the real threat in front of our faces.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The people, the same people that the president of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) invoked from the platform to justify his misdeeds, has said no to 21st-century socialism and the national project promoted by the ruling party.Award-winning Cuban bloggerThere\u0027s nothing wrong, or incendiary, or biased about using \"liar\" when it\u0027s accurate. Even when the liar is today\u0027s GOP frontrunner. In fact, especially when the liar is a political frontrunner eying the White House.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIf it matters that ISIS holds so much territory in Syria, then the November 14 Vienna agreement matters. If territory is going to be taken away from ISIS, then it has to be occupied by somebody else. The \"somebody else\" isn\u0027t going to be Western ground troops.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyWhile those promoting the TPP trade deal said it would advance workers in member nations and allow the formation of unions, the actual language in the agreement offers only false promises of progress. That, in turn, would negatively impact domestic manufacturing.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersInternational President, United SteelworkersPresident, United Auto WorkersDespite the fact that Republicans demand Obama take a stronger stance against terrorism, Republican politicians won\u0027t even pass a law to prevent guns from being sold to those on the nation\u0027s No-Fly List! The NRA is now the best friend an American terrorist could ever ask for.Playwright and Political Science Professor; Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityBeneath of all of this jargon, the French vote (which was the first to take place post-attack) indicates a swing in the political pendulum towards the right. It also shows the direction the next electoral season could take in Europe and America.L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorHere is a condensed version of President Obama\u0027s speech from the Oval Office on Sunday night, unofficially translated into plain English.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027Climate change was not made in India, but the price is being paid in India. Could the grounds for a solution now be laid by India? Could you, the political leader of nearly one-fifth of humanity, make history by securing a deal for the world?Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalMovements to protect Americans from industry malfeasance would prove difficult today. Congress is a wholly owned subsidiary of Big Business. Reporters are not the same for lots of reasons, beyond their control in the new media business. Even after corporate crime and abuse is reported by leading newspapers, efforts in Congress to correct and reform sputters.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI am not saying journalists are the ones we should blame for American\u0027s dysfunctional politics. But I do consider them active participants in the events that got us here.I teach journalism at NYU, write the blog Pressthink.org, try to grok new media.Over the past few weeks, I have become increasingly aware that we, as a nation, are at a decision point. It is a more fundamental question than just Planned Parenthood, gun violence, Muslims, Syria. However, one central question underlies them all.Director of Advocacy, SPARTAIn the next week, millions of Americans will hear and read news stories about global warming. They\u0027ll hear that allowing global average temperatures to increase by more than 2°C would be dangerous. There\u0027s only one problem: Americans think in degrees Fahrenheit.Inaugural Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia UniversityThink about the day she finds out who her parents were. For a while, all she\u0027ll know is that yes, she did have a mommy and daddy, but they died. But one day, whoever is then caring for her may be unable to avoid telling her the rest of the story -- how they abandoned her to do a terrible thing, and how they died.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorFear-mongering statements, often made by NRA and other opponents of any firearms regulations, defy simple logic. We all have heard the claim that guns do not kill people, but people kill people. Precisely due to this reason, I propose nationwide universal firearms regulations and background checks.Professor of Economics, Emeritus at Cleveland State UniversityEurope\u0027s feeble leaders have placed the well-being of their peoples in the hands of the Salman/Salafist branch of the Saudi royal family led by the unstable Crown Prince Mohammed, the reckless Hebrew zealot Netanyahu, and the ruthless would-be Caliph Erdogan in Ankara.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghA climate change denial event in Paris, organized jointly by two U.S groups, held to coincide with the UN climate COP21 talks, quietly flopped Monday when hardly anyone turned up to listen to what actual experts consider to be Heartland\u0027s counter-factual nonsense.Director of Research at The Center for Media \u0026 DemocracyGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
