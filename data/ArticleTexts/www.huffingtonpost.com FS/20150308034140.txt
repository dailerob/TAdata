{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterFifty years later, we remember the suffering and sacrifices of those who set out to march from Selma to Montgomery that day. We honor those who gave their lives as they bravely faced the racial oppression during the Voting Rights Campaign. As our struggle continues and as we remember Selma and Bloody Sunday, let us move forward in the philosophy of Nonviolence. I truly believe that is what we owe those who marched toward violence and racist rage on March 7, 1965. Their resolve and resiliency demands that we lift humanity with the principles and the methodology that transforms us first.This week, The WorldPost conference on \"The Future of Work\" took place at Lancaster House in London.

The choice we do have is how we handle them -- by not letting their problems feed our own.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarChattanooga has proven to everyone else that having a public option for internet, cable, and phone service is better for consumers. And though the big companies would never admit it, the competition that socialist local broadband networks provide is the heart of the free-market capitalism they claim to espouse.Co-Founder of US UncutIt is not the first time our nation has felt that we were headed in the wrong direction. In fact, the father of our country, George Washington, at one time also felt very disappointed in the direction of our newly-formed nation and was not afraid to state it.Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.Now is the time to work toward a world without cancer, and other preventable diseases.

But as the primary victims of climate change, women are also often the main source of solutions.French Minister of Foreign Affairs and International DevelopmentMy eating disorder was about everything and nothing. It brought up issues of control, self-loathing, perfectionism, and spiritual hunger. But it wasn\u0027t traceable to any of these things. And it certainly wasn\u0027t traceable to the desire to attract men.News, entertainment, lifestyle siteThere\u0027s more than enough evidence to show that educating girls is transformational not only to girls themselves but to everyone around them.

The frustration that results often translates into one of medicine\u0027s more common, and most regrettable missteps: blaming the victim.
