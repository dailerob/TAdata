{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranOn Ted Cruz\u0027s presidential campaign website, as the first bullet point under his positions and record on national security and the military, Cruz states that he \"[o]pposed the Obama Administration\u0027s dangerous deal with Iran that would allow Iran to pursue nuclear weapons.\" By \"deal with Iran that would allow Iran to pursue nuclear weapons,\" he means the deal that would end, in a matter of months, Iran\u0027s ability to develop nuclear weapons that they would use to threaten the entire world. It occurred to us at VoteVets.org that there will be a lot of statements from conservative candidates for president that range from \"fudged\" to \"completely wrong.\" Most of these statements are easy to predict. So, as a public service, here\u0027s a cheat sheet for you, so when you hear those statements, you know why they\u0027re just not right.The \"Grow Your Value\" bonus competition drives home the message that it is important for women to both learn their value and communicate it effectively.Co-host, MSNBC’s \u0027Morning Joe\u0027Once more, we must courageously embrace Nonviolence 365, which is based on my father\u0027s nonviolent philosophy and methodology, as the answer to the \"crucial political and moral questions of our time,\" and not as a mere response to incidents but as a lifestyle and a force for good that permeates our culture, including our media and entertainment.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) is now apparently undecided how he\u0027ll buy insurance, backing away from his Obamacare announcement earlier in the week.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027BEIRUT -- With the Iranian involvement against ISIS in the assault on Tikrit, and the Saudi invasion of Yemen to stem the tide of Iranian influence, we have entered a new Middle Eastern war.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027A key section of the secret Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement has been leaked to the public. The New York Times has a major story on the contents of the leaked chapter, and it\u0027s as bad as many of us feared. Now we know why the corporations and the Obama administration want the TPP kept secret from the public until it\u0027s too late to stop it.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSpeech policing advocates forget that there is incredible value in knowing what people actually think, unfiltered. Believing you can conquer racism, bias and bigotry by rooting out microaggressions and enforcing self-censorship and uptightness is like taking Xanax for syphilis.President, Foundation for Individual Rights in EducationPatrick Fuller is a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School\u0027s esteemed Division of Sleep Medicine. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on the importance of good sleep hygiene, how our brain\u0027s clock is connected to our overall well-being, and the problem with sleeping pills.Under New York\u0027s juvenile justice system a child as young as 7 can be arrested for a crime, and a 16-year-old is automatically charged as an adult. These laws are shockingly behind the times -- bad for children and bad for public safety.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundI never wanted to be Barbie. I chose Ken every time. Same goes for playing house; I was never the mother or the daughter; I was always the dad or the son.Wife of a Soldier. Mother to 3 boys. Athlete and sports fan. Admirer of strong, inspiring women. Writer and Founder of TheSidelined.com.It is some sort of amazing Jedi mind trick -- citizens and taxpayers are looking right past the causes of schools\u0027 financial problems and deciding to blame it all on local school boards.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comThe wealthier you are and the more you care about yourself over your neighbor or your country, the more you\u0027ll like this Republican budget. It achieves balance entirely on the backs of middle-class families and our most vulnerable citizens, without asking billionaires or big corporations to pay -- forget a fair share -- one penny more toward our nation\u0027s prosperity.Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandMy mother told me I was pretty all my life because she never would have thought otherwise. She didn\u0027t insist I was pretty because she was obsessed with looks. She insisted because I was her daughter.Actor, dancerThe truth is coming out and Netanyahu\u0027s attempts to correct his errors will do little to change what the world has now finally come to understand, namely that Israel is neither a democracy nor that its five-decades old occupation of four million Palestinians is the fault of the occupied rather than the occupier.Palestinian journalistI love RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race and Modern Family as much as the next gay viewer. But let\u0027s be real here: these shows exist to make us smile and laugh. They do not ask us to critically examine our bodies, existence and behaviors.Writer and Young Professional in New York CityIn the wee hours of the morning, when most people were sleeping, the Senate took a vote that has momentous implications for who will win in 2016 and beyond. In three resounding votes over the last two days, Democrats rediscovered and reclaimed their legacy.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksI\u0027ve just been invited to an exclusive club. It\u0027s not the Soho House. It\u0027s not the Illuminati. It\u0027s not even Costco. For $250, I can get a membership into the hottest club in Los Angeles -- my primary care physician\u0027s patient roster.Comedian, Feminist, Jerk, Southern Belle, Co-Host Throwing Shade Podcast, Writer Funny or DieThe world needs to put the brakes on climate change. But any plan to tackle climate change can\u0027t sacrifice economic growth if we hope to end extreme poverty, reduce inequality, and ensure that poor people gain access to energy. We need to decouple growth from carbon emissions. Here are five ways the world can shift to a low-carbon growth path.President, World Bank GroupThe current dollar episode is a reminder that currency values matter and while manipulation is not in play this time, it could be so again in the future. If the TPP is as important as its advocates say it is, I can think of no better time and place to take preventive action against those who manage their currencies to our disadvantage.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhether you walk in the halls or on the red carpet, promoting our mental well-being is a priority that needs to be taken more seriously.Current CEO, author, entertainment journalist, and teen. Future international human rights lawyer, foreign correspondent, and diplomat working to end genocide.I never met Edward Snowden, but I did know quite a bit about Aaron Swartz. In fact, he worked for me, for a period of time, a few years ago. And he was brilliant, as you\u0027ll see for yourself. I\u0027m sure that whatever this film may say about him, it can barely do justice to what a special human being he was.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictShould you ever find yourself in the unique situation of being out on a golf course alongside some big time CEOs of major corporations, here\u0027s a fun experiment to try. It\u0027s very simple -- just ask the CEOs for their opinion on welfare.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorLAHORE, Pakistan -- I write from a country where people like you and I live with our families -- loving grandparents, self-sacrificing parents with babies, innocent children and know-it-all teenagers. Where we search for tools of peace-building to heal our fractured but shared world.Executive Director, Centre for Dialogue and Action, Forman Christian College, PakistanLatinos have been paying dearly, sometimes with their own lives, for American prohibition without having a seat at the policy making table.Movement Building Team, Drug Policy AllianceWashington\u0027s long streak of bad decision-making often comes down to big money\u0027s influence in our political system. Our representatives are fettered to well-heeled special interest groups who help fund their campaigns in America\u0027s pricey elections.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgA yoga instructor recently encouraged our class to practice our most difficult poses with the understanding that all things come to an end. It\u0027s a bittersweet truth, and one easily lost under 108 inches of snow. But she\u0027s right. All things -- even this terrible, now officially historic winter -- do come to an end.Human Resources Coordinator, Four Seasons Hotel, BostonLook, in the long run, \"f*ck\" is but a word. Is it a word that I\u0027d prefer my kids not go around screaming? Yes. But it\u0027s only bad because we\u0027ve been conditioned to get so worked up about swearing.Father of two and blogger at PuzzlingPosts.comWhile all the poetry in the world might not be worth as much as one good doctor, if there is a reason we are alive, if there is a reason we\u0027re here, it can be found in poetry. It is the barest bones of the human experience and it captures the soul in flight.#1 Bestselling Poet, Creator Of I Wrote This For YouIn the 2012 presidential election, the candidates all remained mum about climate change. Neither the reporters who followed them nor the moderators of the official presidential debates called them out on the issue. Responsible journalists simply cannot let that be the case this time.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectThe successful psychopath remains something of a scientific enigma. This provisional evidence points to some tantalizing possibilities, but we still do not know for sure why one person with pronounced psychopathic traits ends up as a habitual and cold-blooded criminal while another ends up as the prototype for Agent 007.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027When both Barack Obama and James Baker take the same position on a critical foreign policy and national security issue, you know things have changed. When the bald call for automatic support for an Israeli government that has betrayed its own principles and people, and its agreements with the United States, finally turns away former supporters, you know things have changed.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"JURY: NO GENDER BIAS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
