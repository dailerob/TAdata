What\u0027s become apparent to me is that the rate of change on this planet, due to technological, ecological, and financial mechanisms, is the highest it\u0027s ever been. That means that our rate of adaptation must also be high, that we must adapt our communities, companies, and selves to what is quickly becoming a new and different world. We must experiment, or die.Read Post | Comments (88)Alan Schroeder, 02/22/12Professor, School of Journalism, Northeastern UniversityOf the four contenders, Rick Santorum had the best night.

But, in the case of Iran, the rules are changing.Read Post | Comments (189)Jared Bernstein, 02/22/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesPretty much every discussion of tax reform these days ends with an agreement that we need to broaden the base and lower the rates. Well, the White House today will release the broad outlines of a plan to do just that on the corporate side of the federal tax code.Read Post | Comments (144)Margaret Cho, 02/22/12Comedian, actor, and recording artistMy former bullies pay extra to come backstage and meet me after shows, and I pretend not to know them in front of their friends.

That\u0027s one reason I was so drawn to Abundance, a new book by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler.Read Post | Comments (111)Howard Fineman, 02/20/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupIn spite of the ever-deepening flood of candidate advertising, politics (and journalism) today are do-it-yourself, web-based and socially-connected enterprises. Which is where you come in.Read Post | Comments (67)Carla Lohr, 02/22/12Online professional; Volunteer, Shriner\u0027s Hospital for ChildrenWe as a society need to step back and rethink the view we have of disabled children. And the parents who are raising these children have to get serious about bringing these children up with the understanding that they can live their lives to the fullest.Read Post | CommentsMichael Fauntroy, 02/22/12Professor, Author, Columnist, and Commentator at MichaelFauntroy.com.The majority of election cycles between 1964 and 2010 resulted in House incumbent reelection rates of at least 90 percent.

Charles Rangel, 02/22/12Representative from the 15th Congressional District in New YorkSince President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the historic Social Security Act of 1935, unemployment insurance has kept American families from falling into poverty.

Palermo, 02/22/12Associate Professor of American History, California State University, SacramentoPresident Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are fond of repeating the tag line: \"Don\u0027t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.\" And the \"alternative\" is very scary.

Cancer is at once personal and communal. And yet, caring for the sick can feel like writing a travelogue about a country you\u0027ve never visited. You can\u0027t know where you haven\u0027t been.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 02/21/12Co-founder and CEO, Progressive StrategiesThere is simply no way to read the Bible I read and not come to the conclusion that it is overwhelmingly supportive of helping the poor, showing mercy to the weak, refraining from judging, and all kinds of other liberal, lefty, progressive values.Read Post | Comments (1,617)Michelangelo Signorile, 02/22/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; host, \u0027The Michelangelo Signorile Show\u0027 on Sirius XM\u0027s OutQIt\u0027s amazing how coming out of the closet has propelled Sheriff Babeu to publicly espouse a whole other brand of Republicanism than the one he was embracing just days ago.
