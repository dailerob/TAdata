{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThere is a very widely shared myth about \"Washington.\" Accordingly, there are two camps, the right-wing GOP and the left-leaning Democrats, who are more or less matched. Each control one house of Congress, and command about half of the electorate. Hence, the gridlock. Gridlock exists when one party pulls east and the other party pulls west and, hence, nothing budges. This is not the case in Washington. Here, most times, one party wants to move east and the other wants to stay put. Thus, what appears as gridlock is actually one conservative blocking victory after another. The fact that the last Congress passed only half as many bills as most previous ones does not trouble the conservatives one bit.Read Post | Comments (314)Amy Cuddy, 01/11/13Professor, Harvard Business SchoolIt\u0027s not uncommon for people to overvalue the importance of demonstrating their competence and power, often at the expense of demonstrating their warmth. People judge trustworthiness before competence.Read Post | Comments (57)Jaweed Kaleem, 01/10/13Reporter, The Huffington PostNow that the Rev. Louie Giglio, the Atlanta pastor who was going to pray at President Barack Obama\u0027s inauguration but came under fire for an anti-gay sermon, has bowed out, conservative Christians and evangelicals ask: are they welcome in the public square?Read Post | Comments (2,269)Bob Cesca, 01/11/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIt\u0027s becoming clear to me that Tarantino made something far deeper than a spaghetti western. I\u0027ve come to realize that his chosen homage/genre was simply a launching point into a much more substantive story about an unlikely friendship, joined in a quest for an unlikely love story.Read Post | Comments (138)Marlo Thomas, 01/11/13Award-winning actress, author and activistI love Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and I love watching the Golden Globes -- by far the most fun of all awards shows. And this year will be better than ever with those hilarious gal-pals as co-hosts of this weekend\u0027s annual Golden Globe Awards broadcast.Read Post | Comments (12)Arianna Huffington, 01/11/13There\u0027s a growing consensus among military doctors, researchers, and veterans themselves, that conventional treatments aren\u0027t always enough to help vets navigate the consequences of PTSD -- from unemployment and domestic violence to substance abuse, anxiety, and suicide. In this week\u0027s issue, David Wood writes about a tool increasingly used to help veterans confront the many challenges waiting for them when they return home from war zones: yoga.Read Post | Comments (60)Marian Wright Edelman, 01/11/13President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAt the height of the Vietnam War, anti-war demonstrators filled the Mall and confronted the president, Congress, and Pentagon calling for an end to that war. What is it going to take for you and for me to push the president and members of Congress and governors and state legislators to stand up to the NRA, gun manufacturers, and sellers?Read Post | Comments (45)Dan Froomkin, 01/11/13Contributing editor, Nieman ReportsWhen we talk about torture \"working\" -- in the context of al Qaeda, for instance -- we presumably mean successfully extracting accurate information. But that\u0027s not what torture is about, and never has been.Read Post | Comments (19)Bianca Bosker, 01/09/13Executive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostKids these days. Just what are they up to online? Intrigued by one tenth-grader\u0027s musings (via her brother) on trends in the tech world, investor Garry Tan conducted an informal survey of how 1,000 teens and twenty-somethings are using social media.Read Post | Comments (494)Dr. Craig Malkin, 01/11/13Author, Clinical Psychologist, Instructor Of Psychology for HMSModern research on love and attraction suggests that we\u0027re not passive creatures, at the mercy of dwindling hormones or fading looks. In the same way that assuming a \"power pose\" builds our confidence, intentionally engaging in loving, passionate behaviors appears to spark romantic excitement.Read Post | Comments (48)Bob Burnett, 01/11/13Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveRepublicans have no use for government.

Even the drama of death and divorce seem distant, part of the endless cycle of life, not something to dwell in, to linger on, but to face, absorb and pass on.Read Post | CommentsDan Treadway, 01/11/13Associate blog editor, The Huffington PostIf we as a nation are truly upset and outraged by steroid use, why is our concern so targeted? NFL players frequently turn in positive drug tests and the sports media doesn\u0027t so much as flinch.Read Post | CommentsAnn Brenoff, 01/11/13Senior Writer, The Huffington PostThose of us in the second half of our lives mark milestones differently. We see midlife for what it is: a downsizing, not a buildup. It\u0027s nothing to get morbid or depressed about; it is a realization and acceptance of the fact that the things you spent the first half of your life constructing and acquiring are about to get dismantled.Read Post | Comments (52)Ralph Nader, 01/11/13Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAs technology has evolved, so should our expectations about how Congress and state legislatures can advance civic values and consumer interests by facilitating people banding together in effective citizen groups.Read Post | CommentsPatricia Zohn, 01/10/13Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnIt had taken all fall to try to set this up -- and I even had to take a back seat to Lindsay Lohan. But it was worth the wait. Richard Burton was the kind of man I had always imagined for whom one could throw everything over. We all get crushes on movie stars and rock stars but Burton was something unique.Read Post | CommentsMichelangelo Signorile, 01/11/13Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe controversies surrounding former Sen.

That\u0027s a lot of inefficiency in our insatiable quest for the fast-food burger.Read Post | Comments (32)Bill Moyers, 01/10/13Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyRead Post | Comments (78)Jeffrey Young, 01/11/13Huffington Post Health Care ReporterThe health insurance industry fought President Barack Obama\u0027s health care reform law tooth and nail during congressional debate in 2009 and 2010 and continues to criticize it. That doesn\u0027t mean the big for-profit health plans don\u0027t think there\u0027s money to be made from Obamacare, of course.Read Post | Comments (44)Rabbi Jason Miller, 01/11/13Entrepreneurial Rabbi, Technologist \u0026 Rabbi Without BordersThe notion of a Christian boy celebrating a bar mitzvah was enough to irk many Jewish viewers, but the show ruffled even more feathers by using Jewish ritual items for the occasion.Read Post | Comments (14)Tom Zeller Jr., 01/11/13Senior Writer, The Huffington PostDisappointing news this morning from The New York Times.
