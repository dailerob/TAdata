The cause of indignity is not power, nor is it power differences: it is rather the abuse of power.Read Post | Comments (170)BIOLynda Obst, 03.13.2008Hillary, as strong as she is, wins as a victim. That is the trajectory of her career: I am a victim. Punch. So why are women whining and identifying with being the victim again?Read Post | Comments (1080)BIOMarc Cooper, 03.14.2008It\u0027s one thing for the conservative news outlet to snipe away at a candidate like Obama.
