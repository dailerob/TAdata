{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgThere are many ways to look at the climate deal coming out of Paris. We can identify with both those who criticize its lack of ambition, and those who are desperate to celebrate its success. Because the real outcome of the agreement isn\u0027t contained in the text, but what comes after. As always, the amount of change we see will be determined by the amount of courage we have to fight for it. We\u0027re already working with allies around the world to organize a series of massive mobilizations against the fossil fuel industry this spring, and will be doubling down on the divestment campaign starting, well, today. We\u0027ll be doing so with a lot of new promises to put on our placards, and a lot of politicians to hold accountable.Years from now, our grandchildren will reflect on humanity\u0027s moral courage to solve the climate crisis and they will look to December 12, 2015, as the day when the community of nations finally made the decision to act.Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectWhen historians look back on this day, they will say that global cooperation to secure a future safe from climate change took a dramatic new turn here in Paris.Secretary-General, United NationsWe have a chance to choose hope over fear. For our Muslim brothers and sisters\u0027 sake, for our American family\u0027s sake, for our nation\u0027s sake, let us choose wisely.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusIt\u0027s not funny anymore -- it\u0027s getting closer and closer to becoming reality. Donald Trump, leader of the Republican Party. Deal with it, everyone.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIndeed, many environmentalists saw the document produced by COP21 as transformative since it has embedded in it a long-term goal of moving toward a \"deep reduction\" in global carbon emissions through offsets and clean energy.Training a new generation of international correspondents in the digital ageThe future that this generation hands to the next ultimately depends not on our dignitaries and diplomats, but rather on the concrete actions of states and localities, businesses, investors, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, educators, scientists, ecological engineers, utility regulators, legislators, city councils and individual energy consumers.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectThis is a moment when the human community rose to the challenge of the times. On Saturday, more than 190 nations agreed to cut climate change pollution, transition to clean energy and put the world on a course toward ever-increasing climate action. As President Francois Hollande observed, this is the first universal climate agreement in history.Former President, NRDCThis agreement has a solid foundation to build upon as countries have realized that it is in their own interest to cut their carbon pollution. They have concluded that, far from destroying the economy, domestic climate action produces real benefits for their citizens, including new jobs, reduced poverty, and lower mortality rates.Director, International Program, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)The Bay Area, although a global leader in the fight for our climate, still lags behind environmentally for communities of color like West and East Oakland, and Richmond.Co-founder of Green The Church and Senior Pastor at Church by the Side of the Road in Berkeley CA.In the two-plus decades since Rio, member parties have wrangled and promoted self interests without arriving at a final agreement. In fact, each COP has done little more than kick the can down the road to the next conference. Not today; COP21 can declare success in Paris!Professor of Chemistry, York CollegeOver the past 50 years, too many states violated their responsibility to serve their poor and non-White children equitably. With the loss of federal accountability in the new Act, I hope we will not see the mistakes of the past repeated and poor children fall further behind.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFear is on the rise in the U.S. Politicians who stoke fear like Donald Trump benefit in their poll numbers. Strength is not giving in to enemy-stereotyping and it is the only way we will defeat ISIS and the temptation it offers us to overreact. Strength is not giving in to enemy-stereotyping in our domestic political struggles.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryI\u0027ve had the opportunity to conduct public opinion polls across the Middle East in order to provide content for policy discussions at the UAE\u0027s annual Sir Bani Yas Forum. We surveyed over 7,400 adults in six Arab countries (Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE), Turkey, and Iran.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The global climate agreement reached in Paris marks a historic moment for forests as they are now enshrined in international climate action. All countries agreed on simple but strong language that operationalizes forest protection and flips the \u0027on\u0027 switch for the international finance to make it happen.Program manager for Forest Trends’ REDD+ Expenditure Tracking Initiative (REDDX)This is about all of us. It\u0027s not about Muslims versus Christians. Or conservatives versus liberals. Or East versus West. This is not any one country\u0027s war. This is every country\u0027s war.Hashemite Kingdom of JordanDon\u0027t drive yourself mad this holiday season buying impersonal gift cards, candles and lotions for the important people in your life. The best holiday gifts are homemade, and you don\u0027t need to spend days in the kitchen to make it happen.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomWe need to fight against the fear and anger directed at Muslims and others. We need to resist the dangerous prejudices of our past that gave us the Jim Crow laws, the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese incarceration during World War II, and jobs offered with the caveat that Irish, Italians, or Jews need not apply.U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 27th DistrictBlack lives -- 13 of them -- finally mattered Thursday night as an Oklahoma City jury found former policeman Daniel Holtzclaw guilty of 18 criminal counts, including four counts of first-degree rape.The premiere online magazine destination for African-American cultural insight, news and perspective.At the heart of the American mental health crisis today lies the highly flawed, dangerous and unspoken assumption that people with mental disabilities are somehow less than human.Author, Attorney, Activist, UN Global ExpertI wrote for Sinatra once. Although as I\u0027ve become fond of saying, you didn\u0027t so much write for Sinatra as at him.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Among those who founded our nation were those fleeing religious persecution. It goes against those basic American ideals to close our doors to visitors and immigrants based on their religion. It is deeply regrettable that this even needs to be said.Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee; Ranking Member, Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related ProgramsConsent works the same way in the kink world as it does in the vanilla world. If you don\u0027t know what your partner likes or wants, ask. With your words.Writer, artist, kink enthusiastAre we headed for more conflict as too many in the shrinking white population try desperately to cling to the past? Or can we cross this bridge to a new America where we begin to see the \"beloved community\" that Dr. King envisioned?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersAs much as I hate to admit it, however, I can\u0027t shake the notion that there may be value in Trump\u0027s words: they were proof that we all actually can agree on something.President, Spokane Interfaith CouncilIn a provocative interview with Truthdig Editor Robert Scheer for his KCRW podcast \"Scheer Intelligence,\" John Kiriakou, author of The Reluctant Spy: My Secret Life in the CIA\u0027s War on Terror, details his 15 years as a CIA analyst and counterterrorism operation officer specializing in the Mideast.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027That loud sighing sound you heard after the San Bernardino shooting was a collective sigh of relief from guns of all sorts from all over the United States. And for good reason. Each time the mass slaughter of U.S. citizens occurs, the guns worry that someone will remember Australia and Scotland and suggest that the United States should do what those countries did after mass shootings.LawyerIt is the fact that we have indeed \"been down similar roads before\" that should most shake us from any temptation to believe that we are inherently \"better than this.\" Historically, we have been both better than this and worse than this.Executive Director, Center for Constitutional RightsIt is so easy to talk about abstinence. Lots of people could get behind it. Teachers really didn\u0027t need to know anything about reproductive health. They just had to know how to teach kids to say \"no\" to sex. One of the easiest ways to do this was through shame.Reproductive biologist specializing in male fertility and an educator focusing on reproductive health for all ages.What\u0027s happened with the Somali refugees is likely what would happen with the Syrians and other refugees, especially those relocated to smaller, former industrial cities with population drain -- places in need of revitalization.Cross-genre writer based in Boston and MaineIt\u0027s not easy avoiding her -- she\u0027s everywhere.
