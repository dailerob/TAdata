{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFifty years later we must not give up on building a just America that ensures a level playing field for every child and person. We must not let anyone tell us that our rich nation’s vaults of justice and opportunity are bankrupt. And we must not tolerate any longer any resistance to creating jobs, jobs, jobs which pay enough to escape poverty, public and private sector, and providing the education and early childhood development supports every human being needs to survive and thrive. I hope we will commit ourselves on this fiftieth anniversary to building and sustaining a powerful transforming nonviolent movement to help America live up to its promises and forge the will to translate America’s dream into reality for all. Let’s honor Dr. King and save America’s future and soul by hearing, heeding, and following our greatest American prophet.Comments (188)Eric H. Holder, Jr.Attorney General of the United StatesAs we gather today, 50 years later, their march -- now our march -- goes on. And our focus has broadened to include the cause of women, of Latinos, of Asian Americans, of lesbians, of gays, of people with disabilities and of countless others across this country who still yearn for equality.Comments (109)Devon CornealMother, writer, lawyerTo prepare him for the next chapter of his life, there are some things my littlest guy ought to know. If I could get him to sit still long enough to listen, this is what I\u0027d tell him.Comments (75)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowEvery publication makes mistakes. Every major publication has, at some point, botched a story. But the way things are going with The Guardian as it publishes this series of Edward Snowden \"bombshells,\" we\u0027re well beyond isolated glitches.Comments (580)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorAcross the nation, our schools are suffering from budget cuts. As more money is allocated to testing and accountability, less money is available for the essential programs and services that all schools should provide. Our priorities are confused.Comments (260)Eleanor LongdenResearch psychologistOver the years, my voices have changed, multiplied, terrorized, inspired, and encouraged. Today they are an intrinsic, valued part of my identity, but there was also a time when their presence drove me to delirious extremes of misery, desperation, and despairComments (246)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe anniversary of the March on Washington comes at a time when it is hard to feel that the universe is continuing to bend towards justice -- especially for African Americans.Comments (452)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027For decades now, Christians have been the \"invisible or ignored victims\" of conflicts in the Middle East. At best, the US has paid scant attention as once thriving communities of indigenous Christians in Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Egypt have been attacked or threatened.Comments (106)Marie Pasinski, M.D.Harvard Neurologist, Brain Health Expert and AuthorOver time, like Eleanor Longden, you can redesign the infrastructure of your brain. That\u0027s the beauty and the miracle of her story. Nothing will have a greater impact on the quality of your life than discovering your brain\u0027s intrinsic power.CommentsSeth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe \"water found on Mars\" story is as perennial as Christmas. NASA doesn\u0027t need to tell us that again. So why not cut out the seemingly endless stream of robotic middlemen, and just send hardware that will search for life, big or small? Isn\u0027t it time to cut to the chase?Comments (20)Barry EislerNovelist, blogger, former CIAI think it\u0027s obvious to any reasonable observer that the UK authorities detained David Miranda to intimidate journalists and whistleblowers. Does this sort of \"deny and disrupt\" campaign sound familiar? It should: you\u0027ve seen it before, deployed against terror networks.Comments (27)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostBen Affleck will most likely be a fine Batman. Maybe even terrific. No, he won\u0027t be the brooding Batman that we watched Christian Bale play in the last three theatrical representations -- because it\u0027s not really the point to represent dark realism when the point of this Batman is to quarrel with a handsome alien. Ben Affleck is a good choice for Batman. Though, with Affleck\u0027s recent critical success -- culminating in an Oscar win for Argo -- I\u0027m not sure Batman is a good choice for Ben Affleck.Comments (143)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveHypnotized by a toxic blend of Reaganomics and Objectivism, Republicans don\u0027t understand how the economy works or the concerns of middle-class families.Comments (1,538)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe social context of care for schizophrenia is often at least as important as its medical treatment. The obvious question is why has it been so difficult to translate the brilliant basic neuroscience into dramatic clinical breakthroughs?Comments (21)Will BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027While no one can reasonably claim that this Oklahoma tragedy has been ignored, there\u0027s one aspect of the killing that jumps off the page, and yet -- but for a couple of isolated exceptions -- has been all but banned as a topic for discussion.Comments (1,015)Ellen HuertaEntrepreneur and Dream ChaserWasn\u0027t Google supposed to be the best place to work? Wasn\u0027t I supposed to cherish my six figure salary, free meals, massages, etc.? I did feel incredibly thankful, but I also felt like a jerk. The truth was I felt unfulfilled and I was scared to tell anyone.Comments (160)Kristen LevithanWriter and blogger, MothereseInstead of seeing in the moms I encountered potential allies and maybe even friends, I chose to judge them. A lone wolf unsatisfied with my own life, I took my revenge on the other mothers who wandered into my path.Comments (14)Mercedes SchneiderPublic school teacher, education activist, PhDThe AP report is a carefully crafted lie designed to promote an educational system that is high-stakes, standardized-test dependent at the expense of authentic teaching and learning.CommentsJames EhnesViolin soloist; Artistic Director, Seattle Chamber Music SocietyAt a recent concert where I played, a young man in the second row filmed my entire performance on his smartphone. I stared at him with my best, \"seriously?\" look. This is how I make my living, and recording a performance changes the economics.Comments (29)Valerie AlexanderAuthor, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027The future is uncertain, so be happy now, regardless of your bad day, week or year. Next time you can\u0027t find a parking spot, or miss a plane, or have your plans hindered, before you get mad, remember that this could be the best thing that ever happens to youCommentsValerie ErvinCouncilwoman, Montgomery County, MDIn the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement, I believed that little black boys, like my sons, would grow up in a country where they could dream big dreams and become anything that they wanted to be.Comments (12)Katy GrayCreator, \u0027Still Here\u0027 magazineBeing sectioned and locked in a hospital ward wasn\u0027t on my bucket list, but it\u0027s something that has happened to me twice. The first time, I was 20 and in the middle of my studies at university. I had been hearing a voice for two years, a voice I believed was the devil.Comments (25)Arianna HuffingtonOne of the primary things keeping many businesses from adopting more sustainable metrics of success is the stubborn -- and dangerously wrongheaded -- myth that prioritizing health and well-being is incompatible with a healthy bottom line; and that there is a trade-off between high performance and taking care of ourselves. As countless studies show, this couldn\u0027t be less true.Comments (606)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostShe talked to him the way you talk to a child. She talked to him the way you talk to YOUR child. She saw him as a human being, not a monster, and she tried to help him.Comments (496)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolTo his credit, Ballmer invested heavily in R\u0026D, but Microsoft has little to show for it. Like many of its high tech counterparts, Microsoft has been unable to overcome the dominance of its core business.Comments (11)Lorraine Devon WilkeWriter of Sass \u0026 SensibilityMaybe, if society turns against this bilious, brain-battering behavior, we\u0027ll ever-so-slowly advance to a less hate-filled, poop-throwing cultural community. Despite that distant, negative holler -- \"Nah, that\u0027ll never happen\" -- I maintain it would be delightful if it did.Comments (444)Andy BellattiRegistered dietitian; Creator of Small BitesWhile these healthful groups of people may appear to have widely different diets, there is one common thread: Their intake of processed foods, added sugars, trans fats, and artificial ingredients is minimal, if at all existent.Comments (99)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe real question today for long-term investors has less to do with the quasi-inevitably of short-term volatility that comes from expectation of monetary policy shifts in the U.S., and more with whether these short-term bad technicals will contaminate longer-term economic fundamentals.Comments (36)Brittany GibbonsBlogger, \"Brittany, Herself\"The fact is, I am horrible at intimacy. I come from a family of non-huggers and I sometimes hate my body, so yeah, recipe for Temple Grandin hug machine. My husband is gorgeous and very, very sexy, but the issues we were having in the sack were all me.Comments (1,487)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteInstead of acting as the regime\u0027s enabler, the Obama administration should \"reset\" relations with Cairo. The U.S. should cut off all aid and withdraw America\u0027s ambassador. If Washington has any influence to exercise, it should do so quietly and informallyComments (108)Carl PopeFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubWe have been warned. The warnings are coming true. The costs are rising. Yet still we dither. What\u0027s going on?Comments (49)Mark Horvath, 2013.24.08Robert David Jaffee, 2013.24.08The Pet Collective, 2013.24.08David_Halperin, 2013.24.08Jeffrey Sachs, 2013.24.08Christopher Elliott, 2013.24.08Allen Frances, 2013.24.08Judith E.
