{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Hart International, Ltd.It may take the slaughter of small children to finally prompt true minutemen to separate themselves from gun extremists. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that gun ownership is guaranteed by the Constitution and an estimated 300 million guns of various kinds are at large in the nation. It is not realistic to expect a gun-less America. But, whatever else the Second Amendment may or may not mean, it is posited on a \"well-regulated militia,\" a militia mentioned three times in the Constitution. Most hunters and gun owners do not own nor wish to own military assault weapons. They see no need for them. They do not want them. They do not believe such weapons fulfill any perceived need for home security or hunting. Outside the arena of combat, assault weapons serve no plausible purpose. To justify private ownership of combat weapons, therefore, a military purpose must be imagined.Read Post | Comments (54)Sarah Brady, 12/16/12Chair, The Brady Center to Prevent Gun ViolenceThe Brady Law, named for my husband after he was shot in the 1981 attempt to assassinate President Reagan, required background checks for gun purchases from licensed gun dealers. Most private sales, including those at gun shows, don\u0027t require background checks. That\u0027s insanity.Read Post | Comments (11)Thrity Umrigar, 12/15/12Author, \u0027The Space Between Us\u0027Don\u0027t participate in any ritualized expressions of public grief. There have been so many of these already this year. The point is, they don\u0027t help. They don\u0027t change the laws of the land, they don\u0027t weaken the NRA, they don\u0027t frighten the cowardly politicians into action. They change nothing.Read Post | Comments (240)James Zogby, 12/15/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The lights will, for a time, go out in Newtown. And in the Christmas\u0027 to come there will always be an emptiness and a sense of loss. We can pass legislation, and we must, but it will always be too late for the lost children and grieving families of that wounded community -- and this, we should never forget.Read Post | Comments (53)Jonathan L. Walton, 12/16/12Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church of Harvard UniversityDespite the spectacle of terror that Americans have witnessed all too often in recent years, I still believe the best defense against violence is a better offense of love.Read Post | CommentsDaniel Ellsberg and John Perry Barlow, 12/16/12When a government becomes invisible, it becomes unaccountable. To expose its lies, errors, and illegal acts is not treason, it is a moral responsibility. Leaks become the lifeblood of the Republic.Read Post | CommentsEva Alisic, Ph.D. and Lloyd I.

This nation needs healing not just in Newtown, but in every small town, big city and all 50 states that have been affected by senseless gun violence for decades.Read Post | Comments (32)Miranda Pacchiana, 12/16/12Newtown resident, social workerToday, many of our town\u0027s families must grieve their precious children.

We may learn that life means even more to us than we realized before our loved one was taken away.Read Post | CommentsMarty Kaplan, 12/16/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolWhether it\u0027s guns or climate change, poverty or plutocracy, war or water: whatever problem most troubles any of us, I\u0027m convinced that the way forward requires a transformational solution to the power of money and fear to determine our national fate.Read Post | CommentsJoseph Bobrow, 12/16/12Founder and president, Coming Home ProjectOur culture, in which the draw of violence is turbo-charged, glamorized and commercialized, clearly plays a pivotal role in the psychological problems of an alarmingly growing number of young men who commit wanton murder.Read Post | CommentsCaren Chesler, 12/16/12JournalistI\u0027ve always been indecisive. The problem is, it\u0027s a paradox. I don\u0027t trust my own judgment, so by definition, any decision I make is the wrong one, simply because I\u0027m the one who made it. It\u0027s a little like having disdain for a club that would have you as a member.Read Post | CommentsEric Segall, 12/15/12Constitutional law professor, Georgia State UniversityThe harm caused by guns, or people who use guns improperly, is far greater than the harm caused by dangerous uses of speech.
