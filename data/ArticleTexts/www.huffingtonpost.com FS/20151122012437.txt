{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersTo win the \"war\" against ISIS, we must win the moral narrative -- we must reveal ISIS\u0027s distortions and lies and thus destroy their moral and religious legitimacy to those they seek to recruit. The best way to defeat bad religion is with good religion, and the better way to defeat religious fundamentalism is from within rather than trying to smash it from without. The growing controversy over the unprecedented refugee crisis in Syria and Iraq will be a moral test of our battle with ISIS. Comments by presidential candidates and other elected officials calling the nation to shut our doors to the vulnerable millions of refugees, or only admitting Christians as Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have called for, or even shutting down some mosques as Donald Trump has suggested, is utterly shameful and irresponsible.We respectfully but emphatically disagree with your criticisms of our film The Hunting Ground. Instead of making unwarranted and unsubstantiated attacks on the film, we urge you to take a leadership role in addressing the problem of sexual assault that exists on your campus and far too many others.Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"I don\u0027t really care one way or the other whether Princeton erases Woodrow Wilson from its history - except to the extent that such an action would inevitably invite an endless array of similar claims that would both fundamentally distort the realities of our history and distract attention from the real issues of deeply-rooted injustice in our contemporary society that we need to take seriously today.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWhen Donald Trump said he would not rule out special identification cards for Muslims, I got the chills. It took me back to when I was a child, and I learned that Jews were forced by the Nazis to wear the Star of David on their clothing.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeThere have always been two voices competing for the soul of America: one has been welcoming and respectful of diversity, while the other has been intolerant and fearful of those who were different. The tension between them has defined our nation\u0027s history from its beginning.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Republicans, of course, do the whole fear thing very well. Democrats cannot hope to ever stoke the public\u0027s fear as effectively as Republicans. But this week it was on display more than usual, because there are still 14 Republicans running for their party\u0027s presidential nomination.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comTerrorism aimed at civilians leads to justifiable fears about our dangerous world. If we love to travel we need to continue to travel: exploring and enjoying, staying savvy, smart -- and comfortable.Author, Travel Tales I Couldn\u0027t Put in the GuidebooksThe nation\u0027s oldest colleges depended on direct and indirect wealth from slavery and the slave trade. Slaves helped build many university buildings including some at Thomas Jefferson\u0027s University of Virginia.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIf we let fear guide us, then we have already lost. The United States of America was not founded on the principles of fear and fright. Our ideals should not be to enclose ourselves, shutter mosques, reject Arabs and Muslims or let the world fend for itself.Freelance WriterThere\u0027s a reason people always save room for dessert: it\u0027s usually the most memorable part of the meal. This year, ditch the plain ole pumpkin pie for some sweets with a little more pizazz.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomLie number one is that an open-borders world, which obviously has considerable connection to terrorists being able to move internationally and do what they do, is somehow the sine qua non of our prosperity and something we must not give up at any price.Author, \u0027Free Trade Doesn\u0027t Work: What Should Replace It and Why\u0027When you look at the various scenarios for the 2016 general election you reach the following conclusion: the upside for the GOP is much better than any upside for Dems, and the downside for the Dems is much much worse than any downside for the GOP.Political strategistEven if I wreck the pie, drop the turkey, set off the fire alarm, and we all end up at the Shoney\u0027s buffet. I am okay, and I am enough. Just like you.Mom. Writer. Blogger at RealHonestMom.The fears and knee-jerk reactions that accompany them are understandable in the wake of the terrorist attack in Paris, but the cynical attempts by Republican politicians to gain political advantage by stoking those fears and reactions are reprehensible.HistorianNihilism is the wrong word for ISIS. Extremist jihadism is a consequence of faith, not a consequence of losing faith.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorTaking in Syrian refugees, all ten thousand of them, is a must if we are going to maintain our sensitivity to the needs of those who are depending on us, even if we are afraid to do it. Fear is necessary, but peddling it, as many politicians and military industrialists are, is not.Actress and authorUnions are one of the few groups advocating for the interest of working people. If we make it harder for unions to do their job, working people will lose a major ally in the fight to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the richest 1 percent.National President, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIOTeenage girls are sensitive to the way people in authority talk to them, especially their mothers. They are easily wounded, feel criticized, and vulnerable when they sense or get outright disapproval. However, mothers are only trying to shape them up to be young women and don\u0027t understand their sensitive narcissism.Infant-Parent and Child Psychoanalyst; Author, \u0027Unlocking Parental Intelligence: Finding Meaning in Your Child\u0027s Behavior\u0027Black students experience black tape all of the time at Harvard Law. We see black tape when white students overaggressively challenge the intelligence of Black and/or women professors in the classroom.law student, writer, and Quan hitter. St. Louis bred, Cambridge based.Fear is toxic to a democracy. Fear divides. Fear overreacts. Fear discriminates. It\u0027s a lesson we\u0027ve learned throughout our history, from the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 to the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II to the post-9/11 Patriot Act.Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionShe is not perfect, and she does not want to be. She wants us to realize that women are complex, flawed. This is what makes us powerful. Rose is a \"bad feminist because [she is] human.\" Like Roxane Gay. Like me.Writer and editor.Trump\u0027s outrageous idea of creating a Muslim database, Carson\u0027s ridiculous comparison between Muslims and dogs, Bush\u0027s Christian litmus test for Syrian refugees, and Cruz\u0027s politicization of the issue are all empowering ISIS. The terrorist attacks in France were horrific. But Americans should not react out of fear.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorCandidates for public office, especially at the state and national levels, are never asked this central question of politics: \"Since the people are sovereign under our Constitution, how do you specifically propose to restore power to the people in their various roles as voters, taxpayers, workers and consumers?\"Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn 2014, 35 transgender children were murdered. Today, on Trans Day of Remembrance, they are among those we mourn and remember -- people around the world should refuse to forget the young lives lost to prejudice and brutality.Professor of psychology at Curtin University in Perth, AustraliaHuman Rights Watch LGBT rights researcherThe narrative in the mainstream media is that ISIS are against us because they are Muslims, they hate us, they hate our way of life and so on, all against the West.

Former diplomat served in Afghanistan.The Koch network\u0027s secret bank, \"Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce,\" spent big during the 2014 midterm elections, including bankrolling efforts to roll back Wall Street reform. The Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) has been digging into some of the Freedom Partner funding streams.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedIt would be easy to assume, given the ways Buddhist practice has been presented to its target market, that it revolves entirely around meditation: Health and well-being books, magazines and websites are lousy with images of smiling young women sitting blissfully on cushionsThe dharma teacher at DharmapunxNYC since 2005; visiting teacher at Zen Care \u0026 Against the Stream. Josh\u0027s talks: dharmapunxnyc.podbean.com\"Let\u0027s Change\" is an appealing slogan, but the question is \"change to what?\" It seems likely from the interests that Mauricio Macri represents, and his political orientation, that Argentina\u0027s poor and working people will bear the brunt of any economic adjustment.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.Readers -- and taxpayers -- should take these corporate connections into account when assessing the objectivity of pro-bomber pieces like the Mitchell Institute report. Of course, even interested parties can be right some of the time. But that is not the case with respect to the new bomber.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyAmerican public bathrooms are often designed to make the experience exceedingly uncomfortable. Silence about the issue persists, largely because of cultural taboos that discourage any discussion about alleviating design flaws.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.If you\u0027re thinking about adopting a child, remember that it\u0027s a gift you\u0027re getting and it comes with just as much responsibility as if you had your child biologically.
