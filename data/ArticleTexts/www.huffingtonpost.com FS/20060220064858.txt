{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From flywga.orgnewsweek.com/time.comPaul HippTomorrow may be President\u0027s Day, but this past week was all about Vice President Cheney. It started with word that the veep had shot a man in the face (then kept the story under wraps for 18 hours) and ended with a heartfelt expression of regret and contrition... from the guy who\u0027d been shot!

And for those hunting for other topics, don\u0027t miss Andy Stern on Iraq, Harry Shearer on Mardi Gras, Rep. Ed Markey on oil, Laurie David on global warming, Robert Scheer on Condi, Adam Winkler on the NSA, and Jim Lampley and Bill Maher on the Olympics.READ POST | comments (28)02.15.2006 Steve MartinVice President Dick Cheney, while hunting wild geese in the Rose Garden, accidentally shot President Bush twice...READ POST | comments (163)02.14.2006 Nora EphronThis episode has unleashed an epidemic of coming-out-of-the-closet among liberals-who-have-fired-guns...READ POST | comments (90)02.12.2006 Al FrankenAsked why he shot the man, the Vice President said, \"Just to watch him die.\"READ POST | comments (242)02.16.2006 David Mamet\"Vice President Cheney Explains Both His Hunting Accident and His Invasion of Iraq\"READ POST | comments (35)02.13.2006 Bill Maher\"You think he\u0027s hurt.
