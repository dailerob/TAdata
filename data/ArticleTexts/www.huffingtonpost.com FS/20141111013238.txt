Millie is the reason I\u0027m sane. See, Millie is the one who loved me -- tender, unconditional, I-believe-in-you love.Writer, educator, dreamer, bad-assJust as Catholics and Protestants concluded in their Wars of Religion, Sunni and Shia have to exhaust one another before concluding that neither side can determine what their religion is to be.General Editor, The Norton Anthology of World ReligionsAfter the Democrats\u0027 drubbing in the 2014 midterm elections, there have been fervent debates about whether the Party should embrace an economic populism to tap pocketbook frustrations -- or move further to the center in the hopes of capturing more independents.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027TPP and TTIP are everything that people hate about Washington.

The world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Some are even saying that it\u0027s already begun.Former President of Soviet Union, Nobel LaureateWhat is the TPP? A giant trade agreement between the U.S. and 12 Pacific Rim nations now being negotiated in secret. Well, mostly in secret. Around 600 corporations have seen a draft. Yet Congress and the public still have not.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThe new liberal counterpart will be named the State Innovation Exchange, or \"SiX.\" Creative capitalization seems to be their first innovation. But I shouldn\u0027t get snarky about their branding, because the basic idea is a good one: counterbalance the impressive inroads Republicans have made in state legislatures.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideLynch is without a doubt a consummate professional whose entire career embodies impartiality and justice.There may be a lot of thorns everywhere right now, but she is the rose pushing through to lead the way.President, National Action NetworkIn Richmond, California, a slate of progressive candidates faced off against a challenge from pro-business candidates backed to the tune of more than $3 million by the energy giant Chevron.

Within weeks, however, a full-scale bombing campaign was underway against IS across Iraq and Syria with its own \"coalition of the willing\" and 1,600 U.S. military personnel on the ground.
