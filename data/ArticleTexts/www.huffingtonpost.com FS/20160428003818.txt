Travis and I have spent a lot of time walking through not just his big vision for the future, but the cultural values he wants to keep building within Uber so that the company -- as it grows across hundreds of cities, spanning six continents and bringing in millions of drivers -- can continue innovating and evolving. And I\u0027m so excited for the opportunity, as Travis put it in his announcement, to help take Uber to the next level.Donald Trump\u0027s first foreign policy speech was an incoherent mess. Let\u0027s start there. He doesn\u0027t even care enough to think up his own thoughts.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIf we want to change the corruption in the system, we need to become part of the system.

But the world being what it is, we know they\u0027re inundated by a counter-narrative every day that reinforces women (and a lot of other people) as inferior. This point was driven home to me later in the evening by none other than Donald Trump himself.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistThis case deserves much more attention than it has received so far, because it provides an opportunity for the Court to limit the harm it caused by Citizens United and previous cases by ruling that giving money to politicians amounts to free speech, and hence basically cannot be curbed. It could correct what amounts to legalized bribery by ruling that you may give all you wish -- but not get any material benefits in return.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityIf any of this offends you as a white person, I ask simply that you sit with that discomfort for a while. Really feel it. Now imagine that your distress weren\u0027t the temporary consequence of reading an article, but rather the permanent consequence of living in your own skin.Author, Attorney, Activist, UN Global ExpertIt takes humility to act in concert.

It does mean, however, that you need to keep your ovaries in mind along the way.Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, TX, and founder of BabiesAfter35.com.The truly serious matter of the past week is the mounting debate over the possible exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
