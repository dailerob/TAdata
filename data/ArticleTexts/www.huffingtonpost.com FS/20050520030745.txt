{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaLike much of the blogosphere, our Blog has been filled with the Newsweek story -- including new posts from Christie Hefner, Bill Press, Kristen Breitweiser, Richard Bradley, and Michael Smerconish. Luckily, we’re in the AB era (After Blogs). Which means the story is being sliced, diced, parsed, and dissected at lightning speed.My question is: what would Katherine Graham do? And what precisely is Newsweek apologizing for? An improperly sourced story? Or the spread of virulent anti-Americanism around the globe?Read More05.18.2005 Al FrankenThe Coalition Provisional Authority, which we ran, has lost 8.8 billion dollars. By lost, I mean it’s totally unaccounted for. Not only has Congress not \"looked into\" this $8.8 billion and who might have it now, but it seems that some members are completely unaware that this staggering sum, which was supposed to go toward rebuilding Iraq, is missing. The Sunday morning after the White House Correspondents dinner, I ran into Senator George Allen at a brunch thrown by John McLaughlin and his wife. Allen had never heard of the missing $8.8 billion, or at least that\u0027s what he told me. And he\u0027s on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Danielle CrittendenA Senate aide who blogged about her sexual exploits with assorted staffers is now being sued by the counsel for the Judiciary Committee\u0027s antitrust subcommittee for revealing details about their affair -- including “spanking and hair-pulling” during sex. Ah yes, the casual Hollywood reader will think -- hotbed as usual over there. But to those who live and work here, Washington is more Dilbert than West Wing.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Jim LampleySome of the most revered players in baseball, beloved for their hustle and commitment, were juiced to the teeth on greenies every time they wore the uniform. It was one way of conquering a persistent hangover -- and in a world where some of the people were drunk half the time, and half the people were drunk all the time, that was a daily priority for players, managers and executives as well.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Arianna HuffingtonThe Bush White House has proven itself incapable of leveling with the American people about Iraq. But where are the Democrats? Where is Harry Reid? Where is Nancy Pelosi? The only Democrat of note speaking out about Iraq this week is Bill Clinton. And he’s out there prostituting himself and providing cover for the administration’s continued lies.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Richard BradleyTim Noah has an interesting suggestion about the Times\u0027 plan to charge $50 for online access to its columnists: What happens when certain columnists drive much more traffic than others? Will columnists\u0027 salaries now rise or fall in proportion to how many paying readers click on their columns? And will columnists start changing their subject matter in order to attract those lucrative hits? (More Michael Jackson, less foreign affairs.)read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Michael SmerconishNow that 17 people are dead over events sparked by Newsweek’s initial report, some Americans are embarrassed about the prospect of using such interrogation techniques. They must not be watching the same television that I see.read whole post | permalink05.18.2005 Christie HefnerLet’s ask why the Koran story was credible in the first place. Might it have something to do with the accurately reported (in words and pictures) horrible actions that took place at Abu Ghraib, and allegedly at Guantanamo Bay?read whole post | permalink05.18.2005 Bill PressNewsweek relied on faulty intelligence to write a magazine article. George W. Bush relied on faulty intelligence to start a war which has cost over $200 billion, and which has taken the lives of over 1600 Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis. Here\u0027s the difference. Newsweek didn\u0027t know its intelligence was phony. And Newsweek apologized.permalink05.18.2005 Harry ShearerYou may have read about this a couple of weeks ago--a tape, from a source, aired on my radio program, in which Sean Hannity coaches two nurses about to be guests on his Fox TV program about how to respond to the questions of his \"liberal\" counterpart, Alan Colmes. In any case, now here\u0027s the video of that sequence, with the added bonus of some fine Hannitized leg-crossing.permalink05.19.2005 Laurie DavidThe hypocrisy of ExxonMobil’s new multi-million dollar ad campaign is a classic example of extreme hubris: if we say it, it must be so. The ads -- running nonstop on TV and in print -- extol the company’s commitment to our great energy challenges... but cleverly never mention the words “global warming.”read whole post | permalink05.18.2005 Hilary RosenA majority of the Democratic Caucus is ready to vote and lose. They believe that the Republicans will overreach if they win this one and that it will have a \"Schiavo\"-type backlash -- times ten. And plans are to try and make sure that happens.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Seth GreenlandToday, the word “dustbin” doesn’t say contempt the way it did when Karl Marx was slinging it around.

I am today apologizing for the falsehoods that led to an invasion of Iraq that has led not to 17 but approximately 1600 American deaths, over 10,000 wounded, 100,000+ Iraqi deaths and to the collapse of esteem worldwide just when we needed help in responding to the terrorist threat that I exploited for reelection...\"read whole post | permalink05.18.2005 Stephanie SandbergI wonder why, when one is born again, does it seem that in renouncing earlier, possibly sinful experiences, there is little room left for nuance or empathy?
