This varied group includes independent contractors, temporary workers, the self-employed, part-timers, freelancers, and free agents. Most file 1099s rather than W2s, for tax purposes. On demand and on call -- in the \"share\" economy, the \"gig\" economy, or, more prosaically, the \"irregular\" economy -- the result is the same: no predictable earnings or hours. It\u0027s the biggest change in the American workforce in over a century, and it\u0027s happening at lightening speed. It\u0027s estimated that in five years over 40 percent of the American labor force will have uncertain work; in a decade, most of us.Reading the paper is all too often a jarring experience, but it was especially so on Monday. It\u0027s impossible to ignore the disconnect between the well-deserved recognition of Julian Bond\u0027s life, and the stark evidence that we have so far to go in order to secure the ideals he championed.Founder, People for the American WayJoe Biden certainly has got the media talking. All it really took was one leak to Maureen Dowd and a meeting with Senator Elizabeth Warren, and he\u0027s now seriously considering it. But a Biden candidacy bears political examination beyond the simple question of \"Will he or won\u0027t he run?\"Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comGov. Kasich thinks the problem with teachers is the teachers\u0027 lounge. The problem with teachers is this: We are having to deal with laws that are being passed by people who have not one single clue as to what our job entails. Go ahead, good sir! Get rid of the teachers\u0027 lounge. We probably won\u0027t even notice. We\u0027re too busy doing our job.Blogs at accidentaldevotional.com. Lives and teaches in AtlantaCarly Fiorina recognizes the danger that a technology-dominated classroom -- a classroom focused on programmable skills rather than on messy and ever-changing ideas -- will become the location of job training rather than intellectual exploration.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolIt is important that the public have a clear idea of what is at stake in the Fed\u0027s decisions on interest rates. While many politicians and policy experts are grappling with ways to try to lower the poverty rate, the Fed will be directly preventing people from seeing pay increases.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027When I began advocating for misunderstood dogs -- my dogs -- I didn\u0027t think much about the people. I never thought the little website and Facebook page I started four years ago would introduce me to all these wonderful dogs and their equally amazing people.Founder of I\u0027m Not a Monster, Co-creator of IHadCancer.comTransforming the original transistor into the devices that adorn the Apple Watch didn\u0027t require one advance, or ten advances, or even a hundred advances -- it took decades of effort by thousands of scientists and engineers in academic and industrial labs across the U.S.Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Cornell Center for Materials ResearchCalifornia as a whole, like its great university system, is living on capital generated in the past by leaders who had a constructive vision. This generation is letting it run down. Their gaze is fixed on coping strategies while frittering away resources on the grandiose.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghGlobal investors and lenders have learned relatively little since 2008, creating more bubbles, ignoring more warning signs, and, until recently, continuing to party like it\u0027s 1999. The chickens are coming home to roost.CEO of Country Risk SolutionsJust like the GReferendum, the new elections are not about democracy or the voice of the Greek people, they are about increasing the power of Tsipras within his own party, the increasingly misnamed Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), and within Greece.Associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaPlease, pit bull lovers, stop saying \"it\u0027s all how they\u0027re raised.\" I know you mean well. But if you truly believe \"it\u0027s all how they\u0027re raised,\" no stray shelter dog or abused dog would be safe to place in a home.Dog trainer. Canine, feline and equine behavior counselor. Animal behavior nerd.The real war on religion is being waged by those on the Right who read the Bible not as the story of God\u0027s saving interaction with the world through the unfolding of God\u0027s reign, but either as foundational for a conservative politics of self-interest or as a blueprint for a post-Enlightenment cult of individual piety.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistIf only she saw the real him. I wonder how many experiences of unconditional love she and people like her miss out on due to fear and hatred in their heart. They may be one of the One Million Moms, but I feel like the luckiest mom in the world to be Chris\u0027 mom.Feisty physically disabled chick, proud mom, advocate, writer, coffee addict, cat lover, reality TV junkie, eternal optimistISIS took advantage of the failure of the central governments to keep control of civil society in Syria and Iraq. If Lebanon\u0027s government collapses it is possible that ISIS may try to fill the vacuum in the absence of effective leadership.State Representative, MassachusettsThe greatest lessons I have learned about life, I have been taught by fosters. Each and every dog that has shared my home has shared a message with me. So climb aboard the crazy ride we call pit bull rescue. The life you save first will be your own.Executive Director, Lucas County Pit Crew; Special Education TeacherIn 1997, the movie Wag the Dog told the tale of an American President who created a fictitious war against Albania to distract from domestic scandals, ensuring reelection. Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan must have seen it, as he\u0027s following the same script against the Kurds in order to boost his party\u0027s flagging fortunes. But will it work?Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaKatrina pushed us to consider new ways of reaching hard-to-reach populations; now, the challenge is to keep that momentum going, so that the lapses in our initial response to Katrina are never repeated.Physician, epidemiologist, Dean, Boston University School of Public Health. Musing on improving the health of populations.On August 7, the Senate left town for its month-long summer recess, a pretty long break for lawmakers who have accomplished so little. When the Senate returns on September 8, it needs to start doing the people\u0027s business. Surely, the American people, and our federal judicial system, deserve better than this.Vice President, Constitutional Accountability Center (CAC).We had all passed FBI background checks and were instructed to bring nothing into the prison with us, except our gloves, baseballs, batting helmets, four wood bats, water and our drivers licenses, which were shown repeatedly to the guards at the checkpoints leading in and out of the prison.Founder/publisher of Boulder Weekly, an award-winning alternative weekly in its 22nd year of publication.Why are some drugs legal and some prohibited? Why do we arrest approximately 600,000 Americans each year for marijuana possession, but sell tobacco and alcohol on most corners? Why do we lock up people who use meth for years, and dole out the similar drug Ritalin to our children?Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceI am so proud of CPT Kristen Griest and 1LT Shaye Haver, and am excited to watch their career progress. Though, to be honest, I am also a bit jealous. They were afforded an opportunity, gave it their all, and succeeded. It is not a complicated concept. Opportunity preparation \u003d success.Law student; VeteranIt\u0027s hard enough to keep up with changing nutritional guidelines. But unless you\u0027re an expert, it\u0027s damn near impossible to tell the difference between independent research and research ginned up by trade groups and marketers.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorThe American public has given its grade to national elected leaders for their attempts to improve the country\u0027s public schools. The verdict is an \"F\" for failure. Public schools need to do better but that will only occur when there is cooperation in government, not antagonism.Founder, and former President, Center on Education PolicyMocking the absurdity of Lebanon\u0027s politicians and complaining about corruption has become a national past time. The political elite, while still seemingly somewhat in control, have proved themselves to be completely incompetent. Not once, not twice, but relentlessly.Correspondent/producer, VICEThe reality is that spending countless days in the company of a single person can drive even the most loved-up individual to the brink of insanity.Where to go, stay and play on your next great vacation.In the past 2.5 years I have been to 47 cities across three continents.

Founder of Lemonaid-www.lemonaid.ioThis is pretty much as good a ticket as any party could hope for. First, they represent Ohio and Florida: perhaps the two most important states in the presidential election. Losing either would be a tremendous blow to the Democrats. Second, they combine age and youth.Robert W. Winner Professor of Law and the Humanities, and Director of the Schell Center for International Human Rights at Yale Law School.This is an issue that Republicans won\u0027t be able to avoid come general election time. And it\u0027s an issue Democrats must make sure voters remember as well. A vote for a Republican is a vote to repeal health care reform and to go back to people being denied coverage for having pre-existing conditions.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Fried chicken\u0027s feel-good sense of nostalgia is perhaps to blame for its rampant popularity. But that doesn\u0027t mean its preparations have to be limited to fast-food sandwiches.The go-to source for finding the best restaurants and hotelsThere\u0027s no sweeter way to enjoy a summer afternoon than with a heaping cone of fresh-made ice cream.
