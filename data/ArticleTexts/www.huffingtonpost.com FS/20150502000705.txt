{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe undeniable fact that these neighborhoods that are \"left out\" of jobs, education, and family in our society are overwhelmingly black and brown neighborhoods is a testament to America\u0027s lingering \"original sin\" of racism. That is exactly what young people who explode in those neighborhoods feel: They feel left out, and then they participate in self-destructive and community-destructive behavior that is clearly wrong and counterproductive, even distracting from the real issues of racial policing, which usually are the catalytic factors that produce the unrest. So if we just focus on the \"riots,\" or even just on policing behavior, we will not be addressing the root causes of these problems. This is the parable of Baltimore, one that we need to learn from if our responses are ever to be as deep as the problems are. And admitting that the things we accept and don\u0027t accept do indeed have to do with race is a first honest step.We shouldn\u0027t be giving up on monetary policy, which for the past few years has been pretty much the only game in town as far as economic policy goes. Instead, we should be looking for a better balance between monetary and other growth-promoting policies, including fiscal policy.Distinguished Fellow in Residence with the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings InstitutionWe can\u0027t change the terrible experience these children have already lived through, but we must try to ensure that each and every one of the children affected are kept safe, and provided with the food, water and supplies they so desperately need.Actor and Unicef UK ambassadorWhile the world talks about young people\u0027s insularity and solipsism, they\u0027re creating a fascinating and complex world of deep engagement online, a world in which they are not just watching content but becoming part of it by being community members whose comments and fanfiction and artwork and passion have profound impacts on the broader culture.I write books, including Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars. I also make videos with my brother.The more we talk about mental health, the more we get the anti-stigma message out there. This is really key to enabling open, real, and compassionate discussions.Actress and AuthorFounder \u0026 CEO, ShatterproofThat most Americans are falling short on getting the recommended eight hours of sleep per night is nothing new. Clearly though, not everyone who fails to log enough shut eye actually has trouble sleeping. Plenty of us are just staying up too late or putting off bedtime in favor of other activities.Writer, Content Manager at AmerisleepGiving human rights the \"ignorance treatment\" is far from a new approach for policymakers when it comes to taking a position against the perpetrating regimes. It actually follows a pattern that has occurred in relations with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, just to name a few examples.Visiting Fellow at the Center for Transatlantic RelationsSanders is not easy, not blow dried and not scripted. But in a populist moment, he is the real deal -- a full throated, unabashed, independent, uncorrupted, straight-talking populist. And that is a big deal.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureKinship care has been found to help children maintain family, and oftentimes community, connections. There is strong evidence that children placed in kinship care experience greater stability, have fewer behavioral problems and are just as safe children in non-relative care.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundHe doesn\u0027t go on and on about the woods and the rivers -- he goes on and on about working class Vermonters who can\u0027t afford health care and heating oil. His issue is inequality and unfairness, and it has been from the start. And for those of us who do work mostly on the environment, that\u0027s just the kind of ally we need.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027It\u0027s time to \"bring the nag back.\" It is time we start nagging and don\u0027t stop nagging until we get laws changed and we get equality for women once and for all!Oscar-winning actress and humanitarianAmerican friends, especially PEN Club writers, please read, right now, Caroline Fourest\u0027s new book, Eloge du blasphème (In Praise of Blasphemy, Grasset 2015), if you wish to understand.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Body cameras on officers does not mean a 100 percent solution to the problem, or that there won\u0027t be some issues with them, but they are an important initial step. We need them implemented across the country immediately.President, National Action NetworkIt is a dark secret that tobacco companies make more use of these agreements than perhaps any other industry. There have been at least thirty trade and investment cases brought on behalf of big tobacco. The TPP will spur more.Professor, Author, Advocate, Lecturer, and Social CommentatorIf the events in Baltimore tell us anything general this week, it is surely that policies are more important than personalities, and that the solutions to our core problems require more than sound-bites. Yet so far, the 2016 presidential campaign has been remarkably short on policies.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsSocial media is abuzz too -- people posting prayers and calling for donations to one charity or another, or sharing human interest stories.Co-Founder/Executive Director, Hindu American FoundationPew Research is just discovering something: Black people are not all the same. This is a truth that the Black Alliance for Just Immigration (BAJI) has been living for the nearly decade of its existence. And it is a truth that Black people have known for generations.Executive Director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, Co-Founder of Black Lives MatterThis isn\u0027t about a few hippies holding hands or hugging trees now -- it\u0027s about building a better, happier and more prosperous world for all of us.Executive Director of Here NowThe Obama administration\u0027s decision to negotiate with Tehran triggered near hysteria among U.S. politicians and pundits who advocate perpetual war in the Middle East.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe group of Hall of Famers matters, and you should never be shy about fighting for your own version of history. But the greater mission ultimately matters more than any list, any old way you choose it.Member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominating committeeCongress must thoroughly review the tactics that place agents and contractors in cozy contact with the cartels they are supposed to be dismantling. It must also take this opportunity to consider whether the DEA is fulfilling its mandate -- and to reassess that mandate.Director, Mexico City-based Americas Program of the Center for International Policy; columnist, Foreign Policy in FocusIn the 21st century, many seniors are not retiring from something. Instead, retirement is an opportunity for reinventing, reimagining and reconnecting to one\u0027s self, family, friends and community.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralWhile nine in ten Americans agree there\u0027s too much corporate money in politics, Doug Hughes alone decided to carry out a life-endangering mission to expose Washington\u0027s descent into a money-fueled corruption pit.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgI looked down at my car keys, swinging from their red lanyard. It was February. No one goes prom dress shopping in February. But when everyone went in March and April, she\u0027d be dead.Author of the forthcoming memoir, Sally\u0027s CircleWhat do you do when you see clearly that you are not valued in this society? What do you do when your black skin makes you vulnerable to frivolous police stops and eventual violence?Philosopher \u0026 EssayistSome can\u0027t relax unless they know there are no fires burning at work, so they check email surreptitiously while their travel companions are planning the day\u0027s excursion. Not me, not anymore.Online learning executive, mom, runner and MBA studentSelf-love is crucial because your external world will reflect how you feel about yourself.

While I surfed and screamed during the hardest year of my life. Sonny helped me put this thing on film: A story about a 50-year-old woman who\u0027s been through a really, really bad thing and loves the world anyway. He was the perfect person to do it.Actress, Director, ScreenwriterInstead of seeing Baltimore as something separate from ourselves -- a crazed, violent, out-of-control city -- let\u0027s choose to become aware of Baltimore\u0027s light and humanity, and see how we, down to the essence of our being, can become part of Baltimore\u0027s healing.Author: One Less.
