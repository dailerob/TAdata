{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Charles DharapakIt\u0027s hard to know which was the bigger fiasco this week, the M\u0026M balloon in the Macy\u0027s parade or the GOP\u0027s attempt to Swift Boat Rep. John Murtha (but there\u0027s no doubt that Rep. Jean Schmidt was the week\u0027s biggest turkey). Meanwhile, as the annual holiday shopping orgy kicks off, what better time to take a closer look at retailing giant Wal-Mart? Inspired by Robert Greenwald\u0027s \"The High Cost of Low Price\", our HuffPost bloggers did just that. And, for those who missed it, there\u0027s a final helping of Thanksgiving leftovers. All that, Harry Shearer, and much more below in our Sunday Roundup.READ POST | comments (23)11.23.2005 Rep. John MurthaThe American people are ahead of Congress in recognizing that we must give the Iraqis incentive to step up and seize their own destiny so that our young men and women in uniform will not continue paying such a heavy price for an indefinite period.READ POST | comments (463)11.20.2005 Sen. Edward M. KennedyWal-Mart sells itself as the all-American company, but it violates American family values every single day.READ POST | comments (100)11.21.2005 Bill MoyersWith the corporate, political and religious right now exercising a one-party monopoly over Washington, we are going to see such a spectacle of corruption that muckraking journalism could yet produce a new Golden Age of investigative reporting.READ POST | comments (64)11.24.2005 John CusackI was always humbled by Joe Strummer\u0027s grace and intelligence, his passion, and the sheer ferocity of his will... and Jesus Christ that man could fucking rock.READ POST | comments (113)11.25.2005 Rob ReinerCommunities across America are saying enough is enough and banning Wal-Mart from their city limits. Robert Greenwald\u0027s movie lays bare the notion that American consumers will sell their soul for cheap t-shirts.READ POST | comments (41)11.22.2005 Jane SmileyWe are a country that can no longer pay our bills, no longer wage an effective military action, and no longer protect our citizens from disaster.READ POST | comments (81)11.24.2005 Adam McKayI am thankful for the random Chinese building attendant or janitor who locked that door the President tried to open while escaping his press conference in Beijing the other day -- it provided us with an \"uber-metaphoric\" moment for this White House.READ POST | comments (23)11.23.2005 Arianna HuffingtonThe editor of the New York Times Book Review assigned Dowd’s new book to Kathryn Harrison -- the author of a book that Dowd had previously slammed as “creepy” and “vengeful”? Shouldn’t bad blood be an automatic disqualifier when choosing a reviewer?READ POST | comments (118)11.24.2005 David MametREAD POST | comments (51)11.20.2005 Andy SternLess than 48 per cent of Wal-Mart employees are offered medical insurance. And the company\u0027s answer? Hire more healthy people.READ POST | comments11.23.2005 Robert ScheerYou\u0027ve got to hand it to Dick Cheney; no other modern politician has come so close to perfecting the theater of the absurd. Even as he protests his innocence of lying about matters of state, he lies about matters of state.READ POST | comments (102)11.23.2005 Nora EphronI have a fairly serious theory about Thanksgiving dinner, and it\u0027s this: don\u0027t mess with it. What most people make for Thanksgiving dinner is what their mothers made, and you stray from this at your peril.READ POST | comments (89)11.21.2005 Robert L. BorosageWal-Mart set up a war room because it\u0027s scared. Not of competitors whom it can crush, not of politicians whom it can buy. It is frightened of aroused citizens and the power of democracy.READ POST | comments (15)11.24.2005 Paul Reiser\"Let us always give thanks for all that makes our lives better.\" Today: Al Franken. Next week: Particularly Good Soups, The Smooth Flat Part On The Top of Most Dogs\u0027 Heads, and Dick Van Dyke.READ POST | comments (73)11.25.2005 Cheryl SabanWe are on the cusp of becoming the largest \"gray\" cohort ever to live on the planet. And this translates to millions of seniors with the potential to be taken advantage of.READ POST | comments (20)11.21.2005 Jeff JarvisJay Rosen has a suggestion for Knight Ridder\u0027s sale: Entice local buyers. I have to disagree with Jay -- or at least get tougher than he does -- on a few key points...READ POST | comments11.22.2005 Jeremy PikserLater, off the record, Cheney said it is \"an international crime\" to say that an unprovoked invasion of a sovereign state is an international crime and that it is \"torture\" to claim that US forces and intelligence agencies engage in torture.READ POST | comments (26)11.21.2005 Bob CescaSo Wal-Mart won\u0027t sell the morning-after pill. But you can still buy a kick-ass Winchester Model 70 hunting rifle -- and for the lowest price around.READ POST | comments (44)11.22.2005 Paul RieckhoffIn this e-mail, a very close buddy of mine -- currently serving as an officer in Ramadi, Iraq -- speaks with a candor and level of frustration that you won\u0027t hear from the Generals regurgitating White House talking points on TV.READ POST | comments (96)11.22.2005 Jerry and Joe LongA source close to the VP stated “it’s been pretty well verified” the turkey had access to various biological and chemical substances, including what has been termed by a Pentagon informant as “a potential basting agent”.READ POST | comments (15)AP/Matt SlocumFrom washingtonpost.comFrom washingtonpost.comFrom museum.state.il.usAFP/Getty/Mark WilsonLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Advertising  |  JobsCopyright 2005 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"Rove\u0027s Troubles Aren’t Going Away…",".title":"","h2":"Sunday RoundupNew Orleans--a Tale of Two CompaniesUndigestible Sound BitesBlack Friday at the Mall: a Pseudo-Event on SteroidsYour Surrogate Conservative FatherWe May Be Winning, After All!Time for a White House Meeting on IraqTen Commandments for Wal-MartThe Texas Observer at 50Thanksgiving CallingTaking Inspiration and Giving ThanksSuperpower?Thanksgiving ThanksWhy the New York Times Owes Maureen Dowd an Apology\"Compassionate Conservatism\"© at the First ThanksgivingHigher ExpectationsCheney\u0027s Trouble with the TruthThanksgiving DinnerWal-Mart: Size MattersOn Being ThankfulBaby Boomers Beware!Who Wants to Buy a Newspaper?I Know You Are, But What Am I?Wal-Mart: Every Day Low Gun PricesA Letter from Ramadi--\"I Wish Every American Could See This for Him/Herself\"“Pardoned” Turkey To Be Held At GuantanamoFrank Rich: “What Was Not A Lie?”…","h3":"-Harry Shearer-Craig Crawford-Thomas de Zengotita-Ricky Van Veen-Karen KwiatkowskiBlogsColumnistsFull BlogrollNews Sources",".snippet":"","h4":"Reporters On Woodward’s Role In Plamegate: “Consternation,” “Embarrassment,” Unable To Understand…Drug Cartels Using California Public Lands To Grow Marijuana…Vatican Drops Singer Who Promoted Condoms For Anti-AIDS Campaign…Ex-Iraqi PM Allawi Says Current Human Rights Abuses “The Same As [In] Saddam\u0027s Time And Worse”…Growing Trend Of New 9/11 Themed Movies…\"We Are Deputizing The Military To Spy On Law-Abiding Americans In America”…Markings Show “Return Point” For Scientologists To Travel Back In The Future From Other Places In Universe…US News: Feds Investigating At Least 12 Representatives And Senators In Abramoff Lobbying Scandal…The Bush Administration: Judge, Jury And Executioner…North Korea Says CNN Documentary Is Staged “Poor Farce To Improve Its Image”…NY Times: Even Supporters Doubt President…Bush Admin.
