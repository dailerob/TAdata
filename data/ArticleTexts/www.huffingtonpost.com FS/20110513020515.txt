{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeAfter 10 long years, the national conversation on the war in Afghanistan has changed significantly. And now, the hunt for Osama bin Laden, used for years to justify the war, is over. The official reasons for continuing the war are disappearing each day. The threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan has significantly weakened. Many people are shocked when they learn that there are only 100 al Qaeda operatives left in Afghanistan, but more than 100,000 American troops remain.

But it will destroy countless lives. And unlike the natural disasters we can do something to stop it.Read Post | CommentsMarshall Auerback, 05.12.2011Roosevelt Institute Senior FellowMany financial institutions are hopelessly insolvent, holding mountains of toxic waste that will never be worth anything.
