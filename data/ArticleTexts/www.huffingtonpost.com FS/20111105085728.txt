{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupIf you know me you know that I love the Tune Inn, a taxidermy-filled, three-generation-in-one-family hole-in-the-wall bar and grill three blocks from the Capitol. When people come to the Tune Inn, they try to be nice folks, or they are shunned. They can talk politics, but they can\u0027t do it in a mean, exclusivist way. You can be childish but you can\u0027t be a jerk. You\u0027ll be shunned, or thrown out.

But politicians, especially those whose party derives its name from the democratic principle, would be better off remembering another Greek philosopher: Aristotle.Read Post | Comments (29)Brock Cohen, 11/4/11Freelance writer, humorist, educatorNot surprisingly, gaps in literacy lead to wholesale academic failure -- a pattern that repeats itself over generations. The conditions of poverty that beset families hinder literacy and academic growth; conversely, academic failure spawns more poverty -- and so on.Read Post | CommentsMiles Mogulescu, 11/4/11Entertainment attorney, writer, and political activistIt\u0027s time to ask whether the organizational forms and tactics which birthed the #Occupy mass protests are adequate to building a long-term movement which can change the country and the world.Read Post | Comments (41)Erica Heller, 11/4/11Author, \u0027Yossarian Slept Here, When Joseph Heller Was Dad, the Apthorp Was Home, and Life Was a Catch-22\u0027My father was not Hannibal Lecter crossed with Mussolini, as a few have apparently thought I\u0027ve depicted him in my book. His teasing sometimes hit the wrong note, but I think half the time he said things simply because they were too clever to suppress.Read Post | CommentsMark I. Pinsky, 11/4/11Author, \"A Jew Among the Evangelicals: A Guide for the Perplexed\"Unquestionably, there is a dark, fundamentalist side to American evangelicalism. They plot to use their political influence to push the U.S. in a theocratic direction. If they could. The thing is, they can\u0027t.Read Post | Comments (41)Michael B. Keegan, 11/4/11President, People For the American WayWhatever our differences we should all be able to agree that Hitler was not sent by God to convert Jews to Christianity; that Catholicism, Mormonism and Islam, like all religions, are protected by the Constitution; and that Oprah Winfrey is not the Antichrist.Read Post | Comments (76)Dr. Andrew Weil, 11/4/11Founder and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative MedicineThe dramatic rise in depression diagnoses over the last two decades is a great challenge to modern medicine.
