{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressThe Senate\u0027s pro-surveillance wing is scrambling to advance new legislation to preserve the NSA\u0027s unchecked ability to spy on all of us. And they\u0027re in a rush. Authorization for the federal government\u0027s bulk collection of phone records is set to expire on June 1. Their efforts were scuttled last Friday as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell failed to muster the votes needed to continue the surveillance program under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Earlier this week, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr and ranking member Dianne Feinstein delivered legislative proposals to extend bulk collection. In addition, the proposals further weaken recent efforts to make intelligence agencies more accountable to oversight.Clinton is admired -- or at least respected -- for her decades of world travel as first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state. But officials and regular citizens alike were vague at best, suspicious at worst, when asked to judge her accomplishments and strategic vision as secretary of state.Global Editorial DirectorMany liberal analysts speak of a renaissance of U.S.-Iran relations post-deal, which seems premature, but this is the right-wing nightmare. It is also the Saudis\u0027, who have long enjoyed privileged status in Washington.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesIn a series of peculiar events that can only be contextually placed in the reality of the 21st century, football, war, and diplomacy meet and intertwine. Today, Russia and the U.S take one more step in their very own modern adaptation of the Cold War in the curious battlefield of international soccer.Masters in Science in Global Affairs and Transnational Security student at New York UniversityIn the month since he announced his bid, Sanders\u0027 coverage seems to pale in comparison to comparable Republican candidates who face an arduous task of obtaining their party\u0027s nomination. The reluctance is ironic, since the D.C. press corps for months brayed loudly about how Hillary Clinton must face a primary challenger. Now she has one, and the press can barely feign interest?Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaNo one is focusing on THE central issue that potentially can have an enduring impact, regardless of who is elected president of the United States: The initiation of a massive registration of eligible voters and increasing the magnitude of the actual turnout of those persons who have been registered to vote.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityI must see her do evil, and I must revel in it. All of the evil that can be done, I must see done by Cersei Lannister. I can\u0027t get enough. I am aware that this is an unpopular sentiment. Or, at least, it\u0027s an uncommon admission.Founder, Grub Street; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s tempting to view the term as an instance of poor branding. Call it a stay-at-home salary and we can all go home. But the \"wife bonus\" is called a \"wife bonus\" because it comes from the brains of people who still don\u0027t view men and women as equals. Changing the words won\u0027t do anything to change their entrenched attitudes.Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaAt a time when we should be celebrating Medicaid and CHIP successes, serious threats to Medicaid, CHIP and the ACA continue to surface in Congress. So, in addition to advocating for continuing improvements in children\u0027s health coverage, we must also play defense to protect the hard-earned gains made for children as well as adults.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFinding life elsewhere would end our cosmic isolation: if there is life in our own planetary backyard, then life is probably common throughout the universe. These enticing possibilities are why my colleagues and I have spent 17 years developing a spacecraft mission dedicated to understanding Europa.Senior Research Scientist, NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion LaboratoryGiven that \"the facts\" the United States used to justify the invasion of Iraq were all wrong, most of the presidential candidates have admitted they might not have launched that particular war. What we have yet to hear from presidential candidates or the habitual hawks is the appropriate spiritual response to the war in Iraq: repentance.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThere is a distinctly authoritarian directive ominously, if sardonically, commandeering us through Jonathan Monaghan\u0027s 3D film loop, The Pavilion.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoOn Memorial Day weekend, the composer/lyricist and star of In the Heights and Hamilton delivered a hip hop commencement speech at his alma mater, Wesleyan University.President, Wesleyan UniversityHaving a successful marriage has it\u0027s benefits, such as coming home to the love of your life, and giving advice to unmarried people who don\u0027t want it. If you\u0027re not sure if you\u0027ve found the man you should marry, here are nine key signs to look for.Writer, comedian and creator of TheCooperReview.comThe New York Blood Center has abandoned a colony of 66 chimps in Liberia that its research teams used in experiments for three decades, reports James Gorman of the New York Times in a story today. This story is not just about the chimpanzees, but also about the caregivers who have sacrificed so much.President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United StatesThe world capitalist economic system has become so dysfunctional in the 21st Century that it cannot be defended rationally, but requires a particular moral/political ideology grounded in the assumption that human beings are fundamentally to be defined as free, autonomous and rational individuals.Confucian scholarOver the past few days, the Buddhist Relief Services has been distributing food to villagers in the hardest hit regions of Nepal. We understand, what I call, Ground Reality; we see and hear what is happening on the ground, and are able to give aid where no one else has.Founder of the Dharmakaya Organization and Buddhist Relief ServicesThere is a tendency in sports to give breaks to the people who are good at their jobs. We should not do this. But it certainly seems to happen. But when it comes to Isiah Thomas, there is simply no evidence that he is actually good at judging talent.Co-author, \u0027Stumbling on Wins\u0027; Economics professor, Southern Utah UniversityWe don\u0027t need to jump into the arms and beds of different people until one of them decides to stay for a little while longer than the rest. We don\u0027t need titles and commitment that\u0027s rushed, or done so for any reason influenced by others.Writer, Marketing Co-op, and College Student.You are asking me a question that you would never ask my husband. That\u0027s practically the textbook-definition of sexism.Founder of Christian feminist blog Belle Britait\u0027s true that Hillary Clinton has adopted economic rhetoric which is Warren-like, at least in tone. The difference lies in policy specifics, especially on critical economic issues: Warren offers them. So far, Clinton hasn\u0027t.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourFriday, Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht will be sentenced. He faces the possibility of between 20 years to life behind bars because drugs were bought and sold on his website. But Silk Road\u0027s online marketplace actually reduced the harms of drugs in several key ways.Nightlife Community Engagement Manager, Drug Policy AllianceThen you are going to be mad at your parents, at yourselves, at each other, and finally at God. As someone who has escaped a cult, let me tell you now: you are absolutely right to feel every bad thought you are feeling right now.Author, Cultural Theologian, BloggerIt is hard to answer the question: \"What advice would you give a new teacher?\" The problem is that all teachers, even those of us who are most passionate about teaching, have a love-hate relationship with our jobs.Author, Vietnam veteran and math teacher, Dartmouth CollegeWith the prevalence of social media, and the epic rise of companies like Instagram and \"tech celebrities\" like Zuckerburg, it has never been cooler to be a software developer. Breaking into the world of development is radically different, but the process is the same: Don\u0027t be afraid to break stuff.Co-founder, FirehoseProjectI\u0027m sorry if I am raining on your parade but I believe there are some things a marriage can\u0027t recover from. I am living proof of it.Blogger, Urban Homesteader, Storyteller, Library AddictIt\u0027s no surprise that the world of sushi has developed its own set of myths, exaggerations, and bold-faced lies.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelUltimately, if we want to fill our glasses with clean water, and if we want our kids to swim, fish, or play safely in our waters, we have to be willing to protect our all nation\u0027s waters, large and small, from the Great Lakes to the headwater streams.President, EarthjusticeThis time there was no warning. There was no hurricane, no tropical storm warning -- just a flash flood warning, which is common in Houston and usually doesn\u0027t mean homes will flood.Writer, BloggerThe recent Irish referendum was a national act of inclusion and liberation for gay and lesbian people. But it was also a powerful statement to the rest of the world from a country, once considered to be among the most socially conservative.Politician, former Deputy Prime Minister of IrelandSouth Korea\u0027s Jeju Island is a popular tourist destination full of spas, resorts, golf courses, sandy beaches, waterfalls and hiking trails. But if you really want to get rejuvenated, skip the tourist hotspots and go directly to the village of Gangjeong to support the extraordinary community that has been opposing the building of a naval base since 2007.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
