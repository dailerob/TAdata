{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe lower trend in job creation that appears to have taken hold could reverse. Real GDP growth in the first quarter of the year was less than 1 percent, and current forecasts for the second quarter are tracking well above that. But it would be a mistake to write off these dour numbers. Moreover, while the Fed can certainly do no harm by holding rates steady, that\u0027s not the same as helping. And with borrowing costs still as low as they are, a smart move by policy makers would be to quickly start up an infrastructure program, perhaps in areas of water safety or repairing our deteriorating stock of public schools.

Putting Fátima Pelaes in charge of women\u0027s issues would be like appointing a former torturer to head the Human Rights Committee or asking a fox to guard a henhouse.Journalist focused on gender inequality and human rightsHere is a short interview with my father, Cass Sunstein, to mark the publication of his new book, \"The World According to Star Wars.\"Freelance writer and the Staff Writer at the photography blog Feature ShootSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made clear this week not only that he wants Donald Trump to be president, but that the main reason he wants Trump to be president is so that he will be the one picking Supreme Court justices.Host of SiriusXM\u0027s The Agenda Sr. Fellow at People for the American WayOf all the accomplishments and disappointments of the Obama presidency, his nuclear weapons policy is the greatest.

But that\u0027s the position I\u0027ve found myself in.Editorial Assistant, EntertainmentHer most lasting gift to me at that age was the ability to see that even if I wasn\u0027t beautiful, or lovable, or serious enough for the expectations of the world of straight adults, I was unique and brimming over with the possibilities of a big life, and beautiful enough for her.Novelist, award-winning journalist and essayistWorldNetDaily -- the right-wing conspiracy theorists best known for relentlessly pursuing the discredited idea that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president because he may not be an American citizen -- is apparently in serious financial trouble.Founder and Editor, ConWebWatch.com; former senior editor, Media MattersThat we need to do more and better is clear.
