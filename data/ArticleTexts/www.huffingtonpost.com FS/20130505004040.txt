{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAnyone despairing that Congress can\u0027t get anything done should note last week\u0027s swift vote to get furloughed air traffic controllers back to work. Congress can move very quickly and efficiently when it wants to and when their own comfort and that of constituents well-off enough to fly was affected. Reduced unemployment benefits, children dropped suddenly from Head Start programs, poor mothers and babies losing food supplements, teacher layoffs, and cancelled meal deliveries for seniors didn\u0027t move them -- but airport delays as members headed out of town for their April recess were apparently unacceptable.Comments (174)Rita F. PiersonEducational trainer, motivational speaker, authorIn the spring of my career, I found myself questioning the choice of my life\u0027s work. The students did not appear to be motivated, the paperwork was overwhelming and the constant change of educational direction was discouraging. But, I just could not seem bring myself to do anything else.Comments (238)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistBefore Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, Julie Andrews in Victor Victoria and Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot -- throughout history and in almost every culture -- disguising one\u0027s gender has been a common plotline in folklore, literature and theater.Comments (137)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAs new graduates leave college and enter the labor force, they may wish to consider the advice that I was incredibly lucky to receive from my father as a child. Be serious and disciplined in pursuing more than the what, when and why. Also be curious, and think deeply about the how.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarMistakes -- and how parents handle them -- can provide a valuable opportunity for learning. A family setback handled well can help children learn that failure or disappointment isn\u0027t something to fear but, in fact, something both normal and surmountable.CommentsDanielle Kaufman, M.D.Radiologist and Chief of Nuclear Medicine, Kaiser PermanenteLife sometimes presents the strangest coincidences. What are the odds of a husband and wife both realizing they\u0027re gay at the same time without even talking to each other about it?Comments (108)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowEvery year on this day, tens of thousands of people make the pilgrimage to Omaha, Nebraska to hear two of the world\u0027s richest men discuss everything from cultural trends, to love and marriage, to assigning probabilities to terrorist attacks. Those men are Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, of course.CommentsRobert BrusteinPlaywright, director, actor, educator, theater founderIn the \u002760s and \u002770s, young people were referred to as the \"Love Generation,\" partly because of their insistence on sexual freedom, which they proposed as an alternative to the Vietnam conflict. Today\u0027s young people could be more accurately identified as the \"Like Generation,\" for reasons that I will now attempt to describe.Comments (23)Arianna HuffingtonOur culture is obsessed with time. This is our real deficit crisis, and one that, unlike the more commonly discussed deficit, is actually getting worse. In fact, researchers have given this crisis a name: \"time famine.\"Comments (190)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027One way forward is to look again at what President Obama said in his recent speech in Jerusalem where he committed to support Israel while challenging Israelis to recognize and deal with Palestinian need for justice.Comments (12)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe Syrian civil war lurches on, adding new casualties every day. The campaign to push the U.S. into the Syrian civil war also marches on, threatening to add American casualties to the human toll.Comments (334)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPayrolls increased by 165,000 last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 7.5 percent, in a jobs report that painted a considerably brighter picture than last month\u0027s version.Comments (193)Art BrodskyCommunications consultant, proprietor of Continental Drive blogEvery day, stories are in the newspapers trying to figure out what made the Tsarnaev brothers do what they did. To get to the why, you have to get into the head of the person.CommentsAudrey van PetegemChief Editor for The Succulent WifeWhat does \"beauty\" mean? It\u0027s hard to discern, especially in our society, exactly what makes a person beautiful.Comments (21)Caren Osten Gerszbergfreelance writer and co-editor, Drinking DiariesCleaning out my mother\u0027s house has been both painful and eye-opening. Her photos, keepsakes and written words remind me of the amazing woman she once was, and highlight the glaring contrast between her then and now.Comments (43)Tammy Nelson, Ph.D.Sex and relationship expert; Psychotherapist; Author of The New Monogamy and Getting the Sex You Want; International speakerYour friend calls you in the middle of the night, crying. She sniffles and barely manages to say, \"He did it again. He cheated!\"Comments (34)Pilar GuzmanVP Editor in Chief, Martha Stewart LivingAllowing family narrative to evolve, however painful the initial reopening of the wound, allows you to cherry-pick the best of your parents\u0027 gifts with clarity and pass them along to the next generation.CommentsEpicuriousSetting the record straight on Mexico\u0027s most popular cheeses.CommentsJeanette PaviniCoupons.com Consumer Savings ExpertWhen you\u0027re spring cleaning this season, here\u0027s something new to try: Every time you come across something you want to pitch or give away, ask yourself if that item can be used in a different way.CommentsMargaret ChoComedian, actor and recording artistI got in Twitter fights for outing someone. But if public figures came out of the closet, then the LGBT kids who saw them on TV would feel safe, before they even knew why they felt dangerous. Maybe if enough people came out of the closet, gay kids would never feel dangerous.Comments (220)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerToday, the Huffington Post community posted its 250 millionth comment. The conversation is not only alive and well on HuffPost.com but thriving on HuffPost Live, on our international editions and on our iPhone, iPad, and Android applications.Comments (125)Jeffrey YoungHuffington Post Health Care ReporterAmid all the political posturing over the Medicaid expansion that\u0027s part of President Barack Obama\u0027s health care reform plan, it can be easy to lose sight of what\u0027s at stake here for a vulnerable portion of the U.S. population.Comments (56)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50There\u0027s no shortage of words in the English language that are consistently mispronounced.

While it\u0027s so obvious that it\u0027s almost not worth saying, after having my own son after 17 hours of labor, this fact came to my mind in a very profound light.CommentsLarry StraussVeteran high school English teacher, basketball coach, novelistHe was the only openly gay student I\u0027d ever taught, and I admired him for having the courage to stand up to a pretty homophobic culture in South L.A., but otherwise he made no impression on me. He seemed, not surprisingly, content to be invisible -- and I\u0027m ashamed to say that I was content to let him be.CommentsBevis LongstrethFormer SEC CommissionerTo save the planet, we need to create a global movement of ordinary people demanding action now. The people, young and old, rich and poor, must seize power over global policy by taking control away from the fossil fuel companies who now wield it.Comments (18)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Gerry Smith looks at one of the less savory effects of recent technological innovation: the billion-dollar black market for stolen smartphones.
