{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorIt was the spring of a presidential election year, but there was no sense of hope and renewal in the land. Instead, the United States was in the grip of tribalism and seething fear. Voters were energized by anger and resentment. The media ran red with violent language; surging crowds, cops and protesters filled city streets. The main candidates were: a shopworn Democratic front-runner who embodied the party establishment; a white-haired, professorial anti-war protest candidate beloved by college students; a disruptive, race-baiting outsider with a knack for drawing press attention and an unctuous, beady-eyed Republican lawyer practicing dirty tricks.All of us, whether we are ignorant of philosophy or professors of philosophy, find it easier to follow dogma than to think. What Hilary Putnam\u0027s life offers our troubled nation is, I think, a noble paradigm of a perpetual willingness to subject oneself to reason\u0027s critique.Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics, The University of ChicagoThis election cycle, it took Nancy Reagan \u0027s death, ironically, to get a discussion going among the candidates about an issue important to LGBT people. But there\u0027s more to talk about on that issue -- actually talk, beyond the position papers -- and there are more issues affecting LGBT people to have a dialogue about.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostBernie Sanders\u0027 and Donald Trump\u0027s primary victories in Michigan demonstrate Americans\u0027 dissatisfaction with the TPP and other trade deals that promise good job growth for millions of Americans -- while the growth they actually deliver is that of increased economic inequality.Senior fellow, Richman Center at Columbia University; former president, SEIULast Monday Kim Kardashian posted a nude selfie to Instagram which sparked a debate between second and third-wave feminists. Feminists panic like these feuds are a PR situation they need to contain. But, it\u0027s precisely these debates between generations that prove the movement is still moving forward.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostSecretary Clinton has hewed to telling us all what is possible and what\u0027s realistic. She is already acting as if she has the job. But she is forgetting that to actually win the position, it takes more than feasibility. It takes inspiration.Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative of North Carolina\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictHappy International Pi Day to all the math-lovers out there celebrating! And Happy Pie Day to the rest of us who are just using it as an excuse to eat all kinds of pie.TheChicSite.com, Author, Lifestyle Expert, Blogger, Public Speaker, and Mom to 3 Boys!Calling Florida is pretty easy, on both sides of the aisle. Hillary Clinton will dominate, continuing her sweep of the South. The big news here, however, is going to be Donald Trump beating Marco Rubio in his home state.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThe Constitution gives the Senate the power to advise and consent. That body is empowered to say no as well as yes. And the most important qualification for office is philosophical. Put simply: Does the nominee believe the Constitution means anything apart from the jurists\u0027 personal preferences? If not, then the Senate should reject the nomination.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWould it be possible for Donald Trump or some future Trump-like figure to build an armed following of his own? Frighteningly enough, the answer is certainly: yes. And it might not even be that hard.Author of \"Devil\u0027s Game: How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam\"Bernie\u0027s win in Michigan was no \"surprise\". His surge was testimony to his campaign spirit. It also was based on a Michigan rejection of the false promises of Clinton-era corporate and financial globalization policies like NAFTA and the TPP.Former State Senator and leader of sixties peace, justice and environmental movement. Director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center.Ciara and Wilson’s apparently unusual decision to enter into a relationship premised on respect and emotional intimacy shouldn’t be shocking. It’s counter-productive when people (read: women) tear each other down for simply having the audacity to try and be a better woman today than who she may have been yesterday.News Editor, The Huffington PostIf Sanders is denied nomination, there will be a lot of deflated and disappointed Democrats. Clinton supporters may hope they will turn out in force in November, if only to stop Donald Trump. But there has to be more to it than that. A lot of the independents who went for Sanders could stay home, or even switch to Trump.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Other communities nationwide could face a similar public health emergency if elected officials don\u0027t act to beef up U.S. water infrastructure. In recent years there have been reports of high levels of lead in the water supply in Washington, D.C. and Providence, R.I., among other places.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersEquality can feel like oppression. But it\u0027s not. What you\u0027re feeling is just the discomfort of losing a little bit of your privilege.Blogs at theboeskool.com about Jesus, politics and bathroom humorFor many people, \"hired help\" is the only option to get any help at all. It is such a shame that it comes with a negative stigma attached. Is it really so wrong to ask for help if it\u0027s needed? The way I see it now is that my kids got the best of both worlds.Writer, actress, bloggerWhat kind of an unprincipled political party attempts to nullify an entire branch of government? For that matter, what kind of political party wants fewer people to vote?Accountant, political commentator, chess enthusiastThe word \"trump,\" according to the dictionary, is an alteration of the word triumph. And because Donald Trump, the US presidential candidate, appears likely to become the nominee of the Grand Old Party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, we owe it to ourselves to ask in what sense and for whom he represents a triumph.French philosopher and writerI do not raise that question simply as a means of slurring an opposition political candidate, or movement. I raise it as a technical, analytic question that deserves a serious answer.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersBisexually-oriented people often spend years asking themselves \u0027am I bisexual?\u0027 without reaching a conclusion, influenced by society\u0027s misconceptions that bisexuality doesn\u0027t exist or that you need to be equally attracted to men and women to be a \u0027true\u0027 bisexual.Bisexuality Coach and Author of \u0027How to be a Happy Bisexual\u0027.Surely everyone has heard by now the legend of Hillary Clinton\u0027s untrustworthiness. Unauthenticated and mystical, it remains epic nonetheless -- and the more people hear about it, the more they believe.Civil rights lawyer; former state senator, writerIf Erdogan doesn\u0027t act now, he will soon not be able to control the violence currently sweeping Turkey. If he continues to push towards an executive presidency with himself in the seat, he will be a man with considerable power -- except the power to force a violent genie back into its bottle.Turkey expert and Kurdistan correspondentWhen I look at the 2nd Amendment as an Article in the Bill of Rights, one thing jumps out at me which the gun debate seems to have overlooked, namely, that it is the only Article in the Bill of Rights that protects only a certain group of individuals: people who decide to own guns.Mike the Gun GuyI can talk, or write, all day about how I, as a white woman, am a member of and benefit from the dominant culture. But the fact is, I\u0027d never truly thought about what my racially segregated life means or why I should do anything about it.Author of Spiritual Misfit: A Memoir of Uneasy Faith and 50 Women Every Christian Should Know; from Lincoln, Nebraska.The conflict in Syria has now raged for half a decade, and in this time the millions of children affected have had to deal with more suffering and heartbreak than most of us will ever experience. The conflict has placed millions of children in terrible danger, and sadly a real end to the turmoil still seems a distant prospect. More than eight million Syrian children are now in urgent need of humanitarian aid in what is the greatest humanitarian crisis since World War II.Actor and Unicef UK AmbassadorI don\u0027t regret becoming a stripper. Not one bit. Stripping gave me the freedom to work with two of greatest my passions -- writing and food -- without having to run up a huge amount of debt or beg my parents for financial help.Author and Intuitive Business + Success Mentor at ShinyNewLife.comAlmost 700 pledged delegates are chosen on June 7 alone. It seems unlikely that either candidate will accumulate a margin of 700 pledged delegates before then. So this one may come down to the wire.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictIt’s become commonplace to speak of the global war on terror as a “forever war.” But perhaps the problem runs a great deal deeper. Perhaps we are no longer able to end any wars.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogAn expert might be reasonably good at predicting the growth of a single exponential technology, but try to predict the future when A.I., robotics, VR, drones, and computation are all doubling, morphing, and recombining.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZESo what happens next? Will Trump himself become more of a target? Will he ultimately get the message that he\u0027s the one inciting the violence and start to bring down the temperature in the room? Or will he continue to ratchet up the toxic rhetoric until it leads to an awful tragedy?Political and Pop Culture AnalystCasey can\u0027t hold her today. He had a scan with contrast this morning and is possibly radioactive so he isn\u0027t allowed to be close to her for 24 hours. She runs to him when we get home, arms out, calling \"Dada!\" He gently pushes her away.Writer, blogger, family gal, reader, fangirl, and pop culture addictGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
