{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityObama entered the presidency at 47 -- an age at which people as a rule are pretty much what they are going to be. It is a piece of mystification to suppose that we have been denied a rescue that this man, under happier circumstances, would have been well equipped to perform. There have been a few genuine shocks: on domestic issues he has proven a more complacent technocrat than anyone could have imagined -- a facet of his character that has emerged in his support for the foundation-driven testing regimen \"Race to the Top,\" with its reliance on outsourcing education to private firms and charter schools. But the truth is that Obama\u0027s convictions were never strong. He did not find this out until his convictions were tested, and they were not tested until he became president.Comments (143)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorPerhaps you have seen the headlines and the television interviews about how New York City\u0027s new mayor, Bill de Blasio, is closing charter schools, evicting poor minority children, destroying their dreams for the future, and their chance to escape failing public schools. Time for a fact check.Comments (73)Rashard MendenhallNFL Running Back, Arizona CardinalsI\u0027ve greatly enjoyed my time, but I no longer wish to put my body at risk for the sake of entertainment. I think about the rest of my life and I want to live it with much quality. And physically, I am grateful that I can walk away feeling as good as I did when I stepped into it.Comments (211)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Obama is being branded a populist by the establishment press and irresponsible by Republicans for what is really a very tame program. He should at least earn these adjectives and get the public\u0027s attention.Comments (46)Stuart GunterTeacher, North Branch School in Afton, VAIs this what education is -- a way to make more money off of our children? Is this the drive of education in America? What happened to the democratic ideal of education creating an informed citizenry?Comments (47)Patrick SmithAirline pilot, air travel columnist and authorAll we know for sure is that a plane went down with no warning or communication from the crew. That the crash did not happen during takeoff or landing -- the phases of flight when most accident occur -- somewhat limits the possibilities, but numerous possibilities remain.CommentsAmanda DubermanNews Editor, HuffPost WomenThat researchers and health advocates need to presume harsh judgment of sexually active women to convince skeptics of birth control\u0027s utility just reminds us how far we have to go.Comments (59)Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityThe uproar over high-stakes testing associated with Common Core in New York State and complaints that children are being tested on things they were not taught, has obscured the deepening of racial, ethnic and class divisions in education in New York and the United States.Comments (30)Pierce BrosnanActorMust whales and dolphins be subjected to deafening noise that will cause more than 3.5 million instances of temporary and/or permanent hearing loss?CommentsNoah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn honor of my dad, Robert Michelson, one of the most incredible men who ever spent a little time on this planet -- and in honor of the pain and grief and wonder conjured by death -- I am sharing five things that I learned while helping him die.Comments (21)Dr. F. Emelia SamA soul-centered scribe at heart and an Oral and maxillofacial surgeon on the sideThe old paradigm of \"there\u0027s only room for one\" continues to be broken down. We still have a way to go, but it is up to us to create room for the next woman -- not elbow her out of the way.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIt is highly unlikely that the Western governments will seek to use energy commerce with Russia as an instrument of leverage with Russia. The cost-benefit calculations that lead to devalue that tactic conceivably could change were the crisis to deepen.CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsIt causes me actual, real pain when I run into young people afraid of risks -- afraid to strike out on their own because it \"might not work out.\" Might not work out? Of course it won\u0027t \"work out\" at first. That\u0027s part of the fun. OK, maybe not fun, per se. But it\u0027s part of the adventure.Comments (14)Susan Blumenthal, M.D.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralLet\u0027s commit to rectifying the longstanding inequities in research, clinical practice, and the health care system so that women can someday live in an America and in a world without HIV/AIDS.CommentsRep. Barbara LeeU.S. Representative, California\u0027s 13th congressional districtLast week, my colleague on the Budget Committee, Rep. Paul Ryan, put out a report: \"The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later.\" Let\u0027s be clear, this report is nothing more than an ideologically bankrupt battle plan to attack the poor.CommentsJeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"There is no doubt that Russian militarized bullying can lead to the de facto division of Ukraine, an event that would be of grave long-term consequences not only for Russia and Ukraine but for the world. The practical question is whether international law can still function to stop this from occurring. In my view, the answer is yes.CommentsMarty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorI used to believe my tastes marked me as an individual. Now, thanks to algorithms, I know that I belong to taste tribes, and that I\u0027m way more predictable than I could ever have imagined.CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeIt is a sign of how far right the Republican Party has moved that New York Times columnist Ross Douthat describes Rep. Paul Ryan as a \"moderate.\" In any rational look at the spectrum of American political views, it is hard to imagine attaching the word \"moderate\" to Ryan on any issue.Comments (13)Michelle ChenIn These Times and CultureStrikeThough many sex workers do struggle with economic or social hardship, activists say the trade\u0027s underlying moral problem lies not with the profession, but with the society that systematically condemns it.CommentsMichael SmerconishSiriusXM Radio HostMarine Lance Cpl. Matthew A. Snyder was just 20 years old when he died in a one-vehicle Humvee accident in Iraq on March 3, 2006, just five weeks after his deployment. A half-dozen Westboro members picketed Matthew Snyder\u0027s funeral at a Roman Catholic Church in Maryland one week later.Comments (44)Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectIt is extremely disturbing that the government of Malaysia -- by continuing to press this case beyond the bounds of reason, let alone the bounds of justice -- has used the courts to short-circuit the political process.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe nation is still in an economic crisis -- a crisis of jobs, social mobility, wages and growth. We need to start focusing more on the lives that are being devastated by this crisis, and less on the artificial crisis of \"debt reduction.\"CommentsPhilip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America\u0027Obama\u0027s heart certainly seems to be in the right place on this issue. But it will take more than a suggestion to an obdurate Senate to advance this reform. The public, polls show, overwhelmingly supports special health courts. But no change is likely to happen until there\u0027s firm leadership from the president, or a crisis.CommentsKali HawlkFreelance Writer and Blogger. Founder of Common Sense MillennialYes, you only live once. That is an inescapable truth that applies to us all. What is not true is that you have to \"just get by\" financially in order to really live. You can really live right this very moment and save for your future.CommentsMarianne SchnallWriter/InterviewerHelping teens has been a longtime passion of Fonda\u0027s, and learning about their needs, problems and questions compelled her to write her comprehensive new book, for which she consulted with a variety of additional resources and experts.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThis week marks the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court\u0027s decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, perhaps the most important First Amendment case in American history. In the words of the great First Amendment scholar Alexander Meiklejohn, the decision was \"an occasion for dancing in the streets.\" Why was Sullivan so important?CommentsJudith A. SalernoPresident and CEO, Susan G. KomenAnd as we sharpen our focus on the researchers who will deliver tomorrow\u0027s breakthroughs, we in the breast cancer movement must remain committed to supporting the women and men affected by breast cancer today, and especially the low-income, uninsured and medically underserved people who need our help.CommentsDr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistFor most people, the best long-term strategy is to develop a strong, sustainable sleep routine that does not rely on prescription sleep medication. There\u0027s no question this takes work, but the rewards are worth it. Your sleep, your overall health -- and perhaps your memory -- will be better for it.CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThe result of the Republican budget would be opportunity only for those who already have money. So, of course, the GOP had to try to kill a budget conceived under the proposition of opportunity for everyone.Comments (23)Anna KunneckeWriter \u0026 CoachThree years ago, I was living in Tokyo during the March 11, 2011 earthquake. I was plunged into deep fear, and over the next two days I slowly crawled my way out of my panic. Today I\u0027m remembering what I learned in the dark days after that tragic event, and remembering and honoring all those who lost family and friends.CommentsChristopher ElliottAuthor, How to Be the World\u0027s Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle)Silence has been valued since humans started traveling, of course. But the debate about cellphone chatter on planes has touched a nerve, and if the law passes, it could even do something unprecedented: establish that air travelers have a right to a little peace and quiet on their journey.CommentsKaren Gross, 2014.10.03Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey, 2014.10.03Laura Adams, 2014.10.03W.
