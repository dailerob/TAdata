{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaAs expected, the latest edition of Meet the Press, featuring RNC chair Ken Mehlman, was another classic example of why host Tim Russert is fast becoming journalism’s answer to the “E-ZPass,” those electronic tags that allow drivers to go through toll booths without having to stop. On the show today, Mehlman was allowed to distort, twist, manipulate, obfuscate and \"disassemble\" his way through every stop on the disinformation highway. The key to the E-ZPass method is no follow-ups.Take Mehlman’s assertion that “this is the first administration ever that has funded with federal dollars embryonic stem cell research.” Does Russert bother to point out that this is not much of claim since this is the first administration ever to have had the chance to fund embryonic stem cell research? Of course not. Mehlman is in the GOP Express Lane. No need to slow down for little things like facts. Russert actually allows Mehlman to get away with saying, \"So you have an administration that is unprecedented in our commitment to more scientific research,” without offering a spit take, a rim shot, or a “Please, Ken, not even I can let you slide on that one!”Read More06.04.2005 Patricia HeatonWhen my dear friend, Janet Grillo, parks her car in front of my house, I never worry about her \"Recall Bush\" bumper sticker sullying my reputation in the neighborhood.

And not just because of the martinis that usually lubricate our monthly lunchtime downloads. But because we share an inner passion; motherhood. We both carried life, gave life, and organize ourselves around maintaining the lives we gave. Although I disagree with Patty\u0027s position on abortion, I do understand it comes from her compassionate committment to children.read whole post | permalink | comments06.04.2005 Adam McKayI asked if anyone really considered Tom DeLay to be a good man.

What interests me is what the guy discovers after six months of being forced to watch what most Americans choose as their primary news source, local television news: he figures out that it\u0027s too sensational and not serious enough. Helpfully, he blames us, the public. We want the shit, you see...read whole post | permalink | comments06.06.2005 Karen FinleyFor God’s Sake, or should I say, for Ron Hubbard’s sake?

You. There’s a thick wall that separates me from Bill Diamond and trust me, if you knew Bill Diamond the way I know Bill Diamond, you’d have spent your whole life on the other side of that thick wall, too. I feel honored to be able to represent you, the readers. I will give it my all -- for you and for the graft that I love. Craft. Craft that I love.read whole post | permalink | comments06.05.2005 Rep. John ConyersBefore a defendant can be convicted of a crime the judge or jury must find not only that the defendant committed the wrongful act but also did so with a state of mind indicating culpability. In the case of Iraq, the weight of evidence continues to accumulate indicating that the American people and Congress may well have been the victims of a deliberate deception.read whole post | permalink06.05.2005 Dan CarolAt the very-very top-line, we need to be clearly articulating a vision of a “smart war on terror” -- rather than just simply saying “nothing” (mainstream Democrats) or “no war in Iraq” (what progressives have been saying since the 2004 Democratic primaries). Both message frames fail to offer up a contrasting answer to Bush on the core question of how we are going to make Americans feel safe.read whole post | permalink | comments06.06.2005 Jay GordonI just returned from late Sunday evening rounds at a large Los Angeles hospital. A hospital with a good reputation. I was there to check on three normal healthy newborn babies. One of the babies was removed from mom\u0027s room because he had a temperature of 100.6 which was taken after he was unwrapped from his 4 blankets. I blew on him like I would on a cup of hot soup, his \"fever\" went away and the staff backed off their desire to do blood tests and keep the baby in the nursery...read whole post | permalink | comments06.05.2005 Stephen BurtPlenty of big risks remain in the post-Y2K (not to mention post-9/11) world. The lesson isn\u0027t that we should all buy bottled water, guns and jars of peanut butter bigger than our cats, but that a complex society faces real problems, some of which are best dealt with in advance, and many of which require that elected officials to listen to experts and take their advice seriously. That isn\u0027t happening.read whole post | permalink | comments06.05.2005 Sandy FrankI join with Chris Meserole in saluting Jay Winsten for his proposal to fight malaria in Africa by raising money for insecticide-treated bed nets.

If you haven\u0027t been exposed to this posture, you should rectify that situation immediately. Richard Holbrooke doesn\u0027t agree with Condi Rice on a lot of things, but he understands that US bases in Iraq and the various \u0027Stans will come in handy 30 years down the road. That\u0027s just how these people think, and when the mainstream Democratic presidential contenders sit down with their foreign policy teams behind closed doors, that\u0027s how they think too...read whole post | permalink | comments06.05.2005 Chris MeseroleNot everyone on the continent is starving or suffering from AIDS. In fact, many are actually quite healthy and actively working. Yet an American would never know this unless they travelled to Africa or made a point of consuming international news.

Informality has vanished. Host nations spend lavishly on hospitality and call it \"showcasing\". Officials are told to draft statements of stupefying emptiness. Favoured topics include free trade, energy conservation, climate change and, from some sense of shame, poverty.
