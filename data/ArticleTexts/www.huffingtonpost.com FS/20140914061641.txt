{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the country had a national teach-in about domestic violence courtesy of a grainy elevator video showing Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancée Janay Palmer. The dark, disturbing images sparked the soul-searching coast-to-coast conversation this issue deserves. In the two days after the video\u0027s release, calls to the National Domestic Abuse Hotline shot up 84 percent. And while some shamefully implied that victims who stay in abusive relationships are somehow culpable for their abuse, the hashtag #WhyIStayed, begun by Beverly Gooden, provided a harrowing array of deeply poignant answers. Though questions remain about what NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell knew and when he knew it, it\u0027s clear this issue goes far beyond the NFL. Ray Rice is just the tip of the iceberg -- beneath it lies a culture and legal system that perpetuates this kind of violence in millions of cases that we never see.We should understand from the start (as painful as it is true) that the US had a major hand in creating the new ISIS monster. Now, President Obama is getting us still deeper into this never-ending battle with monsters stoked by our own ill-advised policies.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Can you believe in women\u0027s rights and enjoy football? Can you be angry about Ray Rice and the NFL\u0027s inadequate handling of him but still feel okay about watching the game? The answer, to both, is no.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAustralia may be geographically isolated from the rest of the world, but they\u0027re right in the middle with the rest of us in facing the roadblocks that keep us from living a healthy life -- from overwork and exhaustion to burnout and stress, all amplified by technology.The Zionist colonization of Palestine has proceeded primarily on the principle of the quiet establishment of facts on the ground, which the world was to ultimately come to accept. It has been highly successful. There is every reason to expect it to persist as long as the US provides the necessary military, economic, diplomatic, and ideological support.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyThe temple was huge and packed and silent and all her fancy friends were there, as well as many of us girl comics, because we had lost our dear leader (I do see her as my own personal Kim Jong Ill, as she was tiny yet commanded an empire) and so it was our saddest day.Comedian, actor and recording artistIn the 40 years since I was the first woman of color to appear on the cover of American Vogue, things in the fashion realm have gone through a world of change. And yet at the same time -- unfortunately -- many things have remained the same.Supermodel and BusinesswomanWars often fail to solve the problems and ultimately make them worse. War has to answer to metrics, just as more peaceful alternatives do. The war in Iraq was a complete failure with enormous human and financial costs; ISIS is now one of the consequences.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThings will not get fixed overnight in Chicago. But it is heartening to see the impact that athletes can have working with community leaders. It is even more moving to see young men and women take a stand against the violence in their communities and work toward a better future.NBA Hall of FamerAs President Obama gave a national address Wednesday on how he intends to destroy ISIS without putting American \"boots on the ground,\" a potent force of 2,500 combat Marines, backed by attack helicopters and jet strike fighters, was aboard warships trolling off the U.S. east coast.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s possible that, underneath it all, though, we stay because our brains are wired wrong. I know I was addicted to the oxytocin produced by having a man in my life -- no matter how awful a man.Film and TV writer and producer; author, \u0027Love Addict: Sex, Romance and Other Dangerous Drugs\u0027If the mission is truly an open-ended effort to \"degrade and destroy\" ISIS, it is virtually inevitable that more U.S. troops will be sent to Iraq, and that some of them will take on combat roles.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyI have sat in the audience for every taping of the more than 2,000 episodes of the Dr. Phil show, and have been most touched by the guests who share their own experiences of domestic violence. This cause is one I have dedicated the next chapter of my life to. I have to say that I am furious at the NFL!Philanthropist, Author, EntrepreneurRegardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with the views of the super-rich, this state of affairs is an unmitigated disaster for American democracy. Not only does it distort our electoral process, but it corrupts our elected officials and disillusions our citizens.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAny reader unfamiliar with the ACLU\u0027s history and its leadership would be led by Geoffrey Stone\u0027s assertions to believe that the new leadership of the ACLU has come in and turned the ACLU\u0027s policy on campaign finance and free speech upside down. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.Executive Director, ACLU (1978-2001, Retired)\"But there\u0027s really nothing new about this tragedy,\" Dr. Murray told me. \"Nothing new at all. It\u0027s like all these guys read the same abuser handbook. They\u0027re not unique. They\u0027re just abusers, and they all do the same thing.\"Award-winning actress, author and activistImagine the strain of leaving family and friends for months on end in an unfamiliar country, enduring battle and seeing your friends fall to the enemy. Then, you come home to banners, beers and thank yous -- but the nation is focused largely on other issues. You\u0027ve lost a sense of serving a greater mission, and working alongside men and women you would trust your life with.Founder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaUnless President Obama pulls back quickly, his administration risks becoming absorbed in another interminable, unnecessary war in Mesopotamia with unpredictable but almost certainly negative consequences.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe New York Times Magazine has a long article about Eva Moskowitz and her chain of charter schools in New York City. But what Moskowitz does to get high test scores is not a model for public education or even for other charters.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The day when we all eventually do age is real, is out there, is waiting for each and every one of us. It comes even when you feel younger than your years, even when you truly believe that age is just a number and that you are only as old as you feel.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostWhen many people hear child poverty in America, the first stereotype is an inner-city child. But in a nation where over 16 million children, more than one in five, are poor, the truth is that child poverty affects children everywhere, although we know it affects urban, suburban, and rural children in some ways differently.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn the state I was in, I don\u0027t even know if it was day or night, but I was told later that the police came to find me after being alerted by a close friend who had seen the Facebook post on my timeline. When they arrived, I had a bottle of Jack Daniels in one hand and a knife in the other.Professional boxerI don\u0027t think Governor Cuomo\u0027s refusal to debate Zephyr Teachout is really about sexism. It\u0027s about money-ism. In this democracy, not to have money is not to be qualified.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersOn September 13, I put on a dust mask and carried two grocery bags full of produce so that I could pass for a below-Canal St. resident and get close to Ground Zero. It was true that only residents were allowed to cross the barricades, but I felt a strong need to feel connected.Hedia Anvar is an Iranian-American writer currently living in Los Angeles, where she suffers from chronic dichotomy and writes about it at gunmetalgeisha.com.Either we need to redefine what probable cause means and say that police are not subject to it, or we arrest officers right away just as we would with any other person accused of committing a crime.President, National Action NetworkI wanted to help inspire young people at this pivotal time in their lives, before they start to put up walls and say \"why\" vs. \"why not.\" I wanted to help them see that they could \"make a difference\" while making money to pay the rent.Chairman \u0026 Chief Creative Officer, Kenneth Cole ProductionsI\u0027ve never refrained from changing clothes in front of them, or leaving the door open when I shower, or nursing babies without a cover. Because I want them to see what a real female body looks like.Writer, wife, and mom to four energetic little boys. Lover of zombies, baking, and science. Blogger at FightingFrumpy.com.Four years ago the Supreme Court decided corporations were people under the First Amendment, entitled to their own freedom of speech. Since then, Big Soda has poured a fortune into defeating ballot initiatives to tax or regulate sugared drinks.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I used to get so annoyed when outdoor toys found their way indoors: sand buckets and pool noodles, hula hoops and soccer balls, the tricycle, the scooter. Now, I just take three deep breaths and look away.Writer, tween whisperer, toddler wrangler.t is not acceptable that we have to be shown something that we knew occurred in order to be moved.
