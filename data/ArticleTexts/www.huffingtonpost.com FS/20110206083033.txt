{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"With chaos still roiling Egypt, it\u0027s hard to tell if this uprising is Iran 1979, China 1989, or East Germany 1989. We\u0027ll have to wait and watch before we can know.

More importantly, so would the Egyptian people. Social media is once again playing an integral role in a popular uprising. Mubarak and his saber-wielding thugs have desperately tried to shut down the Internet and the press in a frantic attempt to keep the whole world from watching.

These new media tools will play a key role in determining whether Tahrir Square 2011 is more Berlin Wall or more Tiananmen Square.Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 02.02.2011Scholar in Residence at the University of ColoradoThere is a good chance that we are entering a rare cycle of history in the Middle East, with autocracies giving way to fragile democracies that in turn will evolve into radical fundamentalist regimes.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 02.04.2011Fate, fashion and their own faults combine to put the Steelers in a no-win situation in Sunday\u0027s matchup with the Green Bay Packers.Read Post | CommentsSec.
