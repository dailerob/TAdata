{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAs autumn leaves begin to fall, the electoral countdown begins. Not just this year\u0027s but also the presidential contest in 2016 The tempo already has quickened as the could-be candidates skittishly begin to flex and caper in preparation for the big race: the run for the White House. This is a field day for the touts who are ever claiming the inside scoop about this one\u0027s strategy and that one\u0027s form. The smallest signs are seized upon as omens of what is to come. It is all about appearance since there is little of substance except for the usual vapid sound bites. That in itself is not necessarily misleading since our elections do pivot on imagery and posturing rather than the candidates deliberate views on serious issues. The days when an exposition of public philosophy and concrete policy proposals captured the public attention are long gone.Criticizing the president during wartime is fine, as long as it\u0027s based on reality and facts. Hypocrisy, on the other hand, isn\u0027t fine. You either support the president, any president, in wartime or you don\u0027t. You can\u0027t have it both ways.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027What must this past season have been like for a man with still so much life before him, hearing all those eulogies to his youth? \"Ballplayer\" is the only identity Jeter has ever known, and now, at an age when many are only getting started, he will have to redefine his life.Host, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027The answer lies in human psychology. And probably like the old observation about history, people who refuse to understand human psychology are doomed to be victims of psychological manipulation.Former FBI Special AgentGDP growth is less and less relevant to the wellbeing of most Americans. We should be paying less attention to growth and more to median household income.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In my first marriage, which lasted 18 years, I had a hard time being seen naked. Especially in my child-bearing years, when my only purpose was to serve my children, to be their sustenance. My sexuality went right out the window.Dating Guru, Mom Butler, Wife Dominatrix, Slightly MustachioedIf we really want to help the middle class, and most Americans, we need a set of policies that are new and truly address the systemic problem. It\u0027s time to let go of the partisan talking points, and get to work.Political strategistI sigh with relief. We\u0027ve lost many patients since opening the ETU almost two weeks ago, but tonight -- my very last night here -- it doesn\u0027t look like anyone\u0027s going to die.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolOur job is to ensure that his efforts continue on with the next AG, whoever he or she may be. We in the civil rights community must strongly advocate maintenance and continuance of a Justice Department that will fight aggressively in these areas.President, National Action NetworkWe become so busy that we forget to rest: we are wrapped up in work, extracurriculars, projects. Everyone should take some time in the coming weeks -- whether you have holidays to celebrate or not -- and enjoy a bit of a break.President of Yale UniversityAnimal agriculture is responsible for producing more climate change gases than every car, boat, bus, truck, motorcycle and airplane on the planet. Combined.DJ, singer-songwriter and musicianFor half a century beginning with Franklin Roosevelt, there was a direct connection between the problems that afflicted American society and the remedies on offer from our democratic system.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The United States Congress is currently abdicating one of its most solemn duties: declaring when America is at war, and with whom. This is nothing short of disgraceful, and every member of Congress who didn\u0027t actively push their leadership to hold a vote should be ashamed of themselves right now.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAs Roberts desperately struggles to cling to office, he is trying to hoodwink the voters one more time. He never expected that the fact he doesn\u0027t have a Kansas home would be exposed. But he\u0027s been misleading about more than his address for years.Retired AmbassadorHigh recidivism rates mean more people behind bars, and Corrections Corporation of America depends on more and more incarceration to make its billions. Since when do they actually want people to do well after they get out, instead of being sucked back into the system?Staff Attorney at the National Prison Project, ACLUWe overtrain our doctors on the overvalued technical aspects of medicine and under-train them in the undervalued relational skills that have always been at the heart of healing.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityYou could get that hard cheese and that brie-like wedge all as different goat\u0027s milk cheeses.Founder and Host, Potluck VideoThe FBI report not only debunks the \"good guy stops the bad guy\" nonsense, but also gives us some important data to judge the validity of another NRA mantra, namely, whether \"bad guys\" are drawn to commit shootings in gun-free zones.Mike the Gun GuyLast fall, I gave up my employer-based health insurance plan and jumped into New York\u0027s health insurance exchange. Why give up a good health plan (that is partially subsidized by my employer) to become one more person searching for an unsubsidized plan?Statistician and health economist for the United Nations; Teacher, Columbia UniversityEmployers are starting to realize that insurers might not be, as they have claimed, \"part of the solution\" to achieving a more patient-centered health care system. In fact, in some ways they have been part of the problem.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgMuslims, like many other groups that have come to America, are in their immigrant infancy. They have yet to grow the deep roots -- in politics, in the media, in neighborhoods -- that would demystify them to the wider American culture.Reporter, writer, contemplater, inveterate asker of questionsWelcome to the World of Charter Chutzpah! Charters as business windfall, with kids coming in a distant second, except as stage extras when charters march for even more money.Retired high-school teacherI\u0027m not just dining from the dumpster to meet my needs though. I\u0027m doing this to inspire America to stop throwing away food.Eco-adventurer, environmental activist and entrepreneurRecently I turned 30 and sent an email to my subscribers asking readers age 37 and older what advice they would give their 30-year-old selves. The result was spectacular.Entrepreneur and authorToday the Supreme Court is scheduled to discuss seven petitions from five different states urging it to decide on the constitutionality of state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage on a nationwide basis. No one knows if it will decide whether to take any of the cases at this time or defer its decision until a future conference this fall.Media Director, Marriage Equality USALegal Director, Marriage Equality USAWhile all eyes are on Syria and Iraq, another intervention is taking place in Yemen. The coalition involved here is more of an understanding than a military pact, but it is proving to be just as effective.Editor, Middle East EyeLittle kids are honestly the best when it comes to making and keeping friends. Their sense of wonder and overall joie de vivre makes them the perfect magnets for new relationships, while their untainted understanding of logic allow them to make quick and simple decisions about their interactions with others. Given their talent in this area, we adults are wise to take a few tips from our kids.Founder of SocialJane.com, women\u0027s friendship expert, entrepreneur.As Congress skipped town and avoided a vote on war, President Obama announced this week that the US was taking the lead in bombing jihadists in Iraq and Syria, opening what is being widely interpreted as another long and costly American military campaign in the Middle East.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyWhether you write romance, poetry, steampunk, fantasy, literary fiction, horror, or how-to books, your work matters.Author, blogger, traveler, momAccording to sources at the United Nations, neither the troubling events in Syria or Ukraine have changed in the slightest in the wake of a man with so many thousands of Twitter followers deciding to call it quits.Satirist, author of The Official Dictionary of SarcasmWords like \"empire\" and \"imperialism\" do not appear in the mainstream media. We opt instead for the comforting euphemisms -- \"exceptional,\" \"unique,\" \"indispensable.\" Neither will our leaders admit the obvious -- that we have volunteered to sacrifice our youth and our treasure to keep our right to be the world\u0027s policeman, judge, jury and executioner.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"INTRUDER CRASHED EAST ROOM",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
