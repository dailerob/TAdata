{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Saadia ZahidiSenior Director and Head of Gender Parity and Human Capital at the World Economic ForumWith Cold War-style politics gripping Eastern Europe this week, it seems fitting that one of the most iconic Soviet holidays is upon us: International Women\u0027s Day, which began as a socialist celebration of women\u0027s economic, political and social achievements. The holiday has become a modern-day marker of women\u0027s progress worldwide, such as the narrowing of the gender gap in workplaces and the fact that women outnumber men among university graduates worldwide. But it is also a reminder of the work that still lies ahead, which raises the question: how will economic, societal and technological shifts impact gender equality in two decades? In other words, imagine International Women\u0027s Day in 2035.CommentsMalala Yousafzai and Shiza ShahidThe question remains, how do we encourage more men to be advocates for the women in their lives?CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What if deception is in the eye of the beholder?

Today, on International Women\u0027s Day, the United Nations highlights the importance of equality for women and girls to bring about greater social, economic and political progress.CommentsLaura Carmichael and Clotilde Josaime St. JeanMore than a century has passed since the first International Women\u0027s Day, and as we look back to past accomplishments and forward to future goals, we urge readers to take action in one of the most pressing challenges facing women internationally: the present state of maternal and newborn health in developing nations.CommentsSusan Blumenthal, M.D.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralOn this International Women\u0027s Day, it\u0027s time to rectify past inequities -- after all, women\u0027s rights are human rights -- and ensure that women and girls can live in cities with safe public spaces where they can flourish now and into the future.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIn a report that has both good and bad news for the American workforce, February payrolls appeared to shake off analysts\u0027 cold-weather concerns, adding a solid 175,000 jobs and revising job counts for the prior two months up by a total of 25,000.Comments (28)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Do you recall a time in America when the income of a single school teacher or baker or salesman or mechanic was enough to buy a home, have two cars, and raise a family? I remember.Comments (491)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe women of Pussy Riot were attacked again today.

They were attacked with garbage, pepper spray and green antiseptic, leaving them with chemical burns and head injuries.CommentsPamela MeyerFounder and CEO, CalibrateThe logistician Ludwig Wittgenstein said \"nothing\u0027s so difficult as not deceiving ourselves.\" Clear heads are hard to come by, common sense is rarely common, and perception isn\u0027t always reality.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027When listening to the fiery rhetoric and watching the enthusiasm at both AIPAC and CPAC, it becomes apparent that both groups retain the capacity to create problems for opponents. They may be down, but they are not out.CommentsAbby DraperPublicist in Beverly HillsIt doesn\u0027t have to be anything fancy or elaborate, but a simple few days away from the norm with some women you trust is a special kind of cleanse.CommentsBan Ki-moonSecretary-General, United NationsNot long ago, the West African nation of Sierra Leone was home to the world\u0027s biggest peacekeeping mission. Today, troops from that country are donning blue helmets and serving the UN in other hotspots around the globe.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorWhy are media stories on poverty in America so insufficient? Stories that showcase the faces of poverty do not grab the public\u0027s attention the way that entertainment, political and economic stories do -- unless poverty stories are controversial or negative, that is.CommentsHarry BelafonteEntertainer \u0026 ActivistThere is a crisis that demands our urgent attention.

Thank you.Comments (27)Jeffrey LaurentiInternational affairs analyst and commentatorThe United States has proved itself essential to mobilizing the political pressures most persuasive to Putin, and Secretary of State John Kerry is managing the diplomacy with admirable firmness and nuance. But this is really a European affair.CommentsJennifer DziuraCareer and lifestyle writer at GetBullish.comI enjoy beating tests, but I also think the United States would be better off with a completely different set of college admissions requirements that don\u0027t unduly privilege personalities like mine. (After all, no one is more annoying than adults who brag about their SAT scores.)Comments (17)Frances ChanStudent, YaleIn the past three weeks alone, I have spent ten hours at Yale Health, our student health center. The medical professionals think I have an eating disorder -- but they won\u0027t look past the number on the scale, to see the person right in front in them.Comments (53)John GerzemaAuthor, \"The Athena Doctrine: How Women (And The Men Who Think Like Them) Will Rule The Future\"Counterproductive gender biases keep gender equality stagnating: women lead only 4.2 percent of our largest pubic corporations, make up only 14 percent of top officers in corporate America and fill a measly 18 percent of board seats.CommentsRep.
