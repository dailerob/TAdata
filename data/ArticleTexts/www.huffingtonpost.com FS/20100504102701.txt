{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"What was just a troubling oil spill a week ago is now, according to Interior Secretary Salazar, \"potentially...very catastrophic.\" In other words, it\u0027s much worse than we thought. Has there ever been a crisis in the last decade that turned out to be better than we thought it was going to be? Iraq, Afghanistan, Katrina, the housing bubble, the foreclosure and unemployment crises -- all much worse than we thought they would be. The next crisis promising to be worse than we thought is our looming debt crisis. Right now, America is like a patient in danger of suffering a massive debt heart attack. We may be able to postpone things with a bit of outpatient surgery, but we won\u0027t be able to avoid it without some serious lifestyle changes. The economic coronary isn\u0027t quite here yet, but it\u0027s on the way.Read Post | CommentsJames Moore, 05.03.2010Author, Communications Consultant, Novelist Manque\u0027, Genial WiseacreBP, which has been marketing itself as an energy company \"beyond petroleum,\" is setting loose upon the planet what is quickly turning into humankind\u0027s worst environmental disaster.Read Post | CommentsJacob Heilbrunn, 05.03.2010Author, \"They Knew They Were Right: the Rise of the Neocons\"Obama thought he was being oh-so-clever by embracing offshore testing and drilling along the Atlantic coast.

Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of ChicagoIf the President meant to imply that judicial activism is invariably in \"error,\" then he seems to have fallen for the line conservatives have been espousing ever since the days of Nixon: judicial restraint is good, judicial activism is bad.Read Post | CommentsJoe Peyronnin, 05.03.2010NYU Journalism ProfessorBP\u0027s Chief Executive was all over the airwaves saying his company accepts responsibility for the disastrous oil spill.
