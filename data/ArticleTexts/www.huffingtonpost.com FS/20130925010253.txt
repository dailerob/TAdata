{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna Huffington\"The tragedy and the pain that brings us here today is extraordinary,\" President Obama said Sunday, eulogizing the 12 men and women killed in the Washington Navy Yard shooting. \"It is unique. The lives that were taken from us were unique. The memories their loved ones carry are unique, and they will carry them and endure long after the news cameras are gone.\" He spoke of what they gave, how they connected, how much they meant to the lives of the people around them, small kindnesses, lifelong passions, and what made them laugh. For most of us, our eulogy will be not just the first formal marking down of what our lives were about but the only one. The eulogy is the foundational document of our legacy, of how people remember us, of how we live on in the minds and hearts of others. So the question is: Why do we spend so much time on what our eulogy is not going to be?Comments (87)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027There are serious complaints about the inadequacy of Obamacare that will have to be addressed in the years ahead.

The problem hadn\u0027t yet been referred to the drug and weapons industries, to the cosmetic surgeons and the neuroscientists.Comments (23)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorSince we\u0027ve never defaulted, we don\u0027t know how much it will cost.
