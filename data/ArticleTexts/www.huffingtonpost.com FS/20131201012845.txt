{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The debate about immigration reform has been very productive in America over these past several years. And that debate has been won -- by those who favor a common sense agenda for reform. There are really few policy debates left on this issue, except about details. There is no real substance behind the opposition to reforming what mostly everyone agrees is a broken and brutal system. Rather it is politics: angry politics, fearful politics, and, sadly, racially-based politics, with institutional political practices and rules that can avoid democratic accountability. That is just wrong. Democracy is being vetoed by corrupt and racial politics. It\u0027s not just our immigration system that is broken -- our politics are too.Comments (120)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Are people who do physically demanding, not-afraid-to-get-dirty jobs like farming, mining and sheep castration (yes, you read that right) the happiest people on earth?Comments (517)Michael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Rather than objectively communicating the findings of the IPCC to their readers, the New York Times instead foisted upon them the ill-informed views of Koch Brothers-funded climate change contrarian Richard Muller, who used the opportunity to deny the report\u0027s findings.Comments (174)Angela JameneFreelance WriterJust over two years ago, I picked up a free Bible. I had read it before but, this time, almost instantly, in a wave of emotions and realizations and revelations and a wide variety of indescribable sensations, I became a Christian. It happened.Comments (871)Holly SidellWriter. Health and Fitness Professional. Reiki Master.I recently got out of a serious relationship and was \"not excited,\" (strong understatement) to find myself back in the dating world. But, I have been pleasantly surprised with what I have discovered and realized. In fact, I think dating in your 30s is actually pretty rad! Here\u0027s why.Comments (37)Fodor\u0027sFodors.comTraveling alone as an outdoor lover has its own unique set of requirements. Whether you are traveling to an isolated location to quiet your soul or plan to join in outdoor activities with others, the key to a successful solo vacation is knowing what you want to experience and finding the spot that comfortably meets those needs.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarParents have nosed around in their kids\u0027 lives ever since the invention of the telephone, but these days, technology has taken the spying game to an entirely new level with multiple points of entry, from Facebook and Twitter to Instagram, Vine, and Tumblr.Comments (72)James AltucherAuthor and EntrepreneurHere are the rules: I\u0027ve been at zero a few times, come back a few times, and done it over and over. I\u0027ve started entire new careers. People who knew me then, don\u0027t me now. And so on. This is what worked for me.Comments (29)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostBut for one to deny that the Church is anti-gay in one sentence and then to maintain a stance against gay marriage in the next adds injury to insult. Let\u0027s just be very clear here -- if you are against marriage equality you are anti-gay.Comments (116)Cal NewportWriter; Professor, Georgetown UniversityWhy, we might ask, do we so easily accept the assumption that we\u0027re hard-wired for a specific economic pursuit?Comments (92)Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistThe good guys are white, we have learned, after eons of our faces being plastered under cowboy hats and in impeccable Bond suits. White men are Superman, we have learned. Bad men, we have learned, are black. They\u0027re gang bangers and thugs and talk loud and sometimes deliver funny lines where we laugh at their Otherness.Comments (486)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027I have seen news stories, commentaries and tweets implying that our findings have good news for the Muslim Brotherhood, bad news for the military and surprising news about the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In fact the results are far more complex and nuanced.Comments (18)Jon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comWhy did you miss all of these things? Turns out, you don\u0027t actually see everything you see. Meaning, your eyes observe and take in much more information than your brain computes... So, there\u0027s stuff you see, that you don\u0027t actually see.Comments (18)Kevin BaconActorSixDegrees.org has teamed up with the Case Foundation, the Network for Good and CrowdRise to celebrate #GivingTuesday with a call to kick off the holiday season by fundraising for your favorite charity. You\u0027ll help that nonprofit qualify to win matching funds and other prizes.Comments (19)Sarah PowersWriter and mom of three. powersofmine.com thehappiesthome.comI sort of doubt that these mothers who came before us set out to \"be intentional\" about their holiday traditions. My guess is that they did the best they knew with what they had and began it all over again the next year.Comments (14)Sharon Glassmansharonglassman.comThey\u0027re not as overtly ballsy as his lamb job, and I don\u0027t include them on my LinkedIn profile, because who would hire me to do them again? But these tasks scared me senseless and/or made my heart sing. And isn\u0027t that what the best jobs are about?CommentsSen. Tom HarkinDemocratic Senator from IowaEliminating the filibuster on some nominations will not change the basic nature of the Senate as a legislative body.

I\u0027m willing to bet that each one will make you a whole lot happier than getting a great deal at a mall.Comments (90)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsThat\u0027s our entire economic system: buy things. Everybody buy. It doesn\u0027t matter what you buy. Just buy. How appropriate, then, that a holiday created by our ancestors as an occasion to give thanks for what they had, now morphs into a frenzied consumerist ritual where we descend upon shopping malls to accumulate more things we don\u0027t need.Comments (1,677)Karen DawnAnimal advocate and writer; author, \u0027Thanking the Monkey: Rethinking the Way We Treat Animals\u0027Comments (22)Shadi BartschHelen A Regenstein Distinguished Service Professor of Classics, University of ChicagoThe gulf between the Chinese view and the American view is not just a matter of modern political ideology.
