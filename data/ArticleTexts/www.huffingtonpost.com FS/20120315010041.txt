{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"As the seemingly endless GOP nomination fight grinds on, it\u0027s becoming clearer who President Obama\u0027s most formidable opponent is likely to be: himself. Sometimes a long, hard-fought primary is good for a party, forcing the candidates to become stronger, better, and more responsive to the electorate. And sometimes a long, hard-fought primary is bad for a party. Like this year\u0027s GOP race. It\u0027s not surprising that on Intrade the chances of President Obama getting reelected currently stand at around 60 percent, and that crack prognosticator Nate Silver has also listed President Obama \"as about a 60 percent favorite\" against Mitt Romney. And that was in mid-February, before the GOP\u0027s bizarre equation of religious liberty with curtailing access to contraception. So for me this election now has two tracks: 1) Obama vs. the GOP nominee; and 2) Obama vs. Obama.Read Post | Comments (2,391)Ben Affleck, 03/14/12Academy Award-winning actor and screenwriterI believe there is no mission more urgent than to help children who are suffering and I applaud Invisible Children for raising the awareness of Kony.

Roosevelt, welcomed thousands of children from England during World War II. It is out of this respect, and out of a fear for how money is corroding America\u0027s political system, that I call for a rethink of how we approach campaign finance.Read Post | CommentsThomas de Zengotita, 03/14/12Contributing Editor, Harper\u0027s MagazineWhy do I say that?

In that regard, and speaking exclusively in policy terms, I found recent statements by Gov. Romney to be deeply troubling, though potentially effective.Read Post | CommentsJames Kwak, 03/14/12Associate professor, University of Connecticut School of Law, and co-author, White House BurningIf people realize that the government\u0027s principal activity is protecting them against long-term risks through programs that they already like, they may change their opinions of the government and their willingness to pay for it.

Today\u0027s textbooks contain no stories of actual people. We meet no one, learn nothing of anyone\u0027s life, encounter no injustice, no resistance. This is a curriculum bound for boredom.Read Post | CommentsThalia Zepatos, 03/14/12Director of Public Engagement, Freedom to MarryWe hereby give you our blessing to go ahead and get married, because every wedding in America is an opportunity for all those who attend to think about how unfair it is for anyone to be denied the happiness, joy, love, support, and legal protections that come with marriage.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 03/14/12Co-founder and CEO, Progressive StrategiesIt is amazing we live in a culture that allows the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the country cheat their clients and the public at large with impunity, and that their closest political allies aren\u0027t held to account as well.Read Post | CommentsKarthik Palaniappan, 03/14/12High school junior in Issaquah, WAThe fact of the matter is that the Kony 2012 video is misleading.

In Europe, the numbers are even worse.
