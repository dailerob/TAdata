{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressIn 2012, what\u0027s so great about having principles? Sure, Mitt Romney might have nothing but an empty space where is \"core\" should be, but his awkward, rapid repositioning in Ohio demonstrates that you can rent that space for cheap. Your other GOP frontrunner of the moment, Herman Cain, has evinced a similar malleability. Don\u0027t like his \"9-9-9 plan?\" Well, it\u0027s a \"9-0-9\" plan now! What is it that you want Cain to say about abortion? Fine, that\u0027s what he thinks now. For the moment, it sure seems like the GOP base is warming up to the idea that the best candidate for president is someone who is an empty vessel into which it can pour its resentments and who it can browbeat with relative ease. Mitt Romney fits that bill.Read Post | Comments (66)Dylan Ratigan, 11/1/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027Our courts have as of yet been exempt from the same level of scrutiny as Congress and our politicians, but there is a pervasive, ongoing corporate attack on judicial integrity, and what we\u0027re seeing is that a lack of aligned interests, secrecy, and corruption are eroding that system as well.Read Post | Comments (170)Alistair Rennie, 10.25.2011General Manager, Social Business, IBMSocial business is no longer \"nice to do,\" it\u0027s a necessity to survive today\u0027s volatile business climate.
