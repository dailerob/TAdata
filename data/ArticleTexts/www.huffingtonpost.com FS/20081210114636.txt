{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOTwo years ago I took on Mr. Blagojevich in the Democratic Primary. It was already clear back then that he was deeply involved in the kind of pay-to-play politics that have tainted Illinois for too long. I\u0027ve received dozens of calls and messages this morning.

In addition to having a terrible haircut, he\u0027s going to go down in history as the worst politician in the history of Illinois politics--a high bar to pass, but one he\u0027s passed handily.Read Post | Comments (23)BIOLaurence Leamer, 12.09.2008Caroline Kennedy does nothing publicly without thought and calculation.
