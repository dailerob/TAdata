{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Political theorist - Founding Director \"Civic Inquirer\" - author of \"Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\" \u0026 \"Abandoned To Ourselves\"What do they really want? That\u0027s the question everyone is asking about both the Germans and the Greeks. Aspirations explicit and veiled circulate. But recent events -- negotiations, stalemate, trash talk, referendum, shutdowns -- have moved many options off the table. A thunderous \"no\" vote in Greece drowned out the more pointed \"no\" from Germany. Both these negatives were expressions not of will but of weakness. Yes, that\u0027s correct, German weakness, too. Is this something Alexis Tsipras can exploit? On such a field of increasing obstacle and impediment is where the next battle will play out. Politics is like this.We believe more must be done to speed the development and delivery of treatments for cancer and many other diseases based on proven science, without compromising safety -- indeed, while increasing our confidence in these potentially valuable treatments.Cancer advocate; Host of \u0027Katie\u0027; and Award-Winning JournalistDirector of the Health Care Innovation and Value Initiative at the Brookings InstitutionChairperson and Founder of Friends of Cancer ResearchThere\u0027s no question that Nixon was a complex figure, but diagnoses of his psyche from afar are theories lacking proof, readings of his soul as well as his mind by people who never knew him.JournalistMathias Basner is an assistant professor of sleep and chronobiology in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania\u0027s Perelman School of Medicine, and the deputy editor of the journal SLEEP. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on the effects of sleep deprivation, the relationship between work and sleep, and the small steps anyone can take to improve their sleep immediately.At first sight, there is little to connect the ugliness in China and Greece. The former reflects the unwinding of a market bubble; and the latter is driven by weak and deteriorating economic and financial fundamentals. Yet both share a common element, and they are not the only ones: They have benefited from the ultra-loose experimental policies that have been pursued by major central banks around the world.Chief Economic Advisor, AllianzSteven Salaita is absolutely right to say that the University of Illinois\u0027s \"actions threaten principles of free speech, academic freedom, and critical thought that should be the foundation of any university.\" It is just that he and his friends in the boycott community are doing exactly the same thing for the same bad reasons.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International UniversityWe Muslims are already a deeply marginalized people in mainstream American culture. We shouldn\u0027t be perpetuating our marginalization by marginalizing others. Rejecting the right to same-sex marriage, but then expecting empathy for our community\u0027s struggle, is hypocritical.Founder, AslanMedia.com; Author, \u0027Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\u0027ComedianMy dad grew up as a middle class Irish Italian kid with the quintessentially Irish name \"Stephen Michael Maloney.\" Only that wasn\u0027t the original surname on my father\u0027s birth certificate. He was born \"Stephen Michael Menéndez.\" That\u0027s a hell of a heritage swing.Writer and editor from New Orleans.Even though the for-profit college industry is now publicly discredited and on the ropes, facing collapsing enrollments, plummeting share prices, and growing federal and state law enforcement investigations, some GOP White House candidates are now brazenly competing for cash in the 2016 for-profit college primary.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgNot to be a buzz kill, but if you light up a joint or unwrap that edible, chances are your weed came from an illegal grow farm in Northern California where forests were cleared, rivers were sucked dry or tainted with chemicals, and animals were poisoned.Executive Director, The Nature Conservancy of CaliforniaAs a black man who had admired Cosby, I am dealing complex and conflicted feelings of what Cosby once was and who he really is. There is no way to reconcile Cliff Huxtable with Bill Cosby.Voices Editorial FellowNot only will there be fewer jobs for people doing manual work, but the jobs of knowledge workers will also be replaced by computers. Almost every industry and profession will be impacted, and this will create a new set of social problems -- because most people can\u0027t adapt to such dramatic change.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurNot long into my tenure as a Facebook designer I found something in the company glyph kit worth getting upset about. The iconic man was symmetrical except for his spiked hairdo but the lady had a chip in her shoulder. I assumed no ill intentions, just a lack of consideration, but as a lady with two robust shoulders the chip offended me.Design Manager, FacebookSen. Whitehouse likened the industry\u0027s actions to those of the tobacco companies that conspired to manufacture doubt about the link between smoking and disease when they were all too aware of it. In 2006, a federal district court ruled that the tobacco industry\u0027s deceptive campaign to maximize its profits by hoodwinking the public amounted to a racketeering enterprise.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsWhere Walmart goes, others follow. And that can have a profound effect on how and what our country purchases. Still, the company could do much better. And it could start by being honest about the numbers behind its purchasing pledge.President, Alliance for American ManufacturingThe first thing is that he would seek the truth of the matter. It seems to me that what we are being offered are two separate and irreconcilable narratives.Christian Author and SpeakerTo help introduce a new and improved regimen, I\u0027m proposing to invite 10 prominent politicians to an informal dinner. The group will answer two sets of six questions. In this round, there will be no discussion of political issues. The goal is simple: to recognize each other\u0027s basic humanity.Founder, Practically Republican, Fifth Generation RockefellerWhen Gurdit Singh was offered a job in 2008 as a mail carrier at Walt Disney World, he was thrilled. On his first day, however, it quickly became apparent that his new job might not be the path to happily ever after he had imagined.Senior Staff Attorney, ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and BeliefCivil rights attorney at the Sikh CoalitionA recent article in the Washington Post repeatedly downplays the significance of 26 million Facebook users changing their profile photos to the colors of the rainbow flag. I disagree. The victory of same-sex marriage can (and should) be shared by the entire country.Writer, graphic designer, illustrator \u0026 dadThe world may be about to discover the true significance of China\u0027s emergence as one of the two largest economies on the planet.Founder, GlobalEconomicCrisis.comMedia StrategistThere\u0027s a growing bipartisan push in some states to stop issuing marriage licenses altogether in a surprisingly good, \"smaller government\" way. SamePageNation\u0027s \"There\u0027s a Contract for That\" imagines what life might look like and pokes fun at the outlandish extremes some have suggested would be possible.Military veteran, Executive Director of SamePageNation and Foundation for Common Sense, writer, political activist on Constitution issues.The reasons that so many have not been able to imagine Cosby as a serial rapist is that the American imagination has been and still is captive to stereotypes of gender, race and even economic class. These stereotypes have combined to promote disbelief of the many women who have said over many years that Bill Cosby sexually assaulted or raped them.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryDinesh D\u0027Souza Posts Fake Hillary Photo; Trump is a Whiny Diaper Baby; Ben Carson Blames Obama for the War on Women; Disturbing Bernie Sanders News; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Why would Russia vote to deny recognition of the Srebrenica genocide? Today\u0027s vote mattered. It mattered hugely to the families of the victims of the Srebrenica genocide. Russia\u0027s veto is heartbreaking for those families and it is a further stain on this Council\u0027s record.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsAn acquaintance once told me that exes who remain in communication with each other are either f*cking or fighting, and while it does seem to be true in many cases, I think there\u0027s a third way.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityUnderstanding that each of us has elements of good and bad, light and dark, beauty and ugliness -- do we in the end think the good triumphs in the long run, that light wins over dark and that beauty overcomes ugliness?Political strategistSpecial Olympics athletes were told that they would never amount to anything and their families were encouraged to institutionalize them. Their victory is not only the result of the same hard work that all athletes put in, but also the courage to overcome obstacles many athletes do not face and redefine what is possible.Nadia Comaneci, Olympic Gold MedalistWe are all a product of our upbringing, and Bristol grew up a fundamentalist Christian in a patriarchal society, the daughter of a highly visible Republican. She grew up surrounded by ideas of what a good woman is and what a good woman isn\u0027t. She is what she was raised to be.Feminist, environmentalist, writerPart of #BlackTwitter\u0027s appeal to black social media users is that it is a space where they can produce and consume alternative narratives not just in accord with the mainstream gaze, but also away from it. It isn\u0027t just a platform, it is also a refuge.Arts \u0026 culture journalist. Chicago is my heartbeat.We have not abandoned our Christian roots. We are simply slowly abandoning a general sense of religious culture as the norm, and this is a good thing.Christian, devoted husband, and seeker of truth.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
