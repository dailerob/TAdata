{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Muhammad AliBoxing LegendMandela. One name. One man. One mission: Saving a nation from itself. Few men in the history of mankind have had more impact on a nation and inspired the world. Mandela. He led his country from the viciousness of apartheid to the glory of a multiracial democracy, peacefully. Has an individual ever given more to a nation and a cause? Only those who have sacrificed their very lives. Mr. Mandela could have easily spent those 27 years of incarceration abroad, protesting the evil from afar, safe from repercussions. Not him. If his people suffered, he would suffer with them. I know something about protest. I know well the feelings and questions that run through the mind of those who stand against a system, braving everything for a cause. It is never easy. The personal price is high, but the greatest of people persevere for the greater good. Modern South Africa is built on the back of Mr. Mandela\u0027s sacrifice. It still amazes me, even to this day, that a man could give up two and half decades of his life, emerge from prison and forgive his imprisoners.Comments (143)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOToday is an extremely sad day. Nelson Mandela, one of most courageous leaders, has passed away. South Africa -- indeed, the whole world -- is saying goodbye to a great human being and an incredible inspiration.CommentsDiane PhamSenior Editor, InhabitatMost of us don\u0027t think twice about what it really means to switch on a light when night falls or to pour a glass of water to quench thirst, but there are billions of people worldwide who struggle for access to these simple things in life. These ingenious designers have created practical, ingenious and inexpensive design solutions that address the need for basic shelter, education, clean water and renewable energy.CommentsKumi NaidooExecutive Director, Greenpeace InternationalThe world has lost a true leader, a true father and a true inspiration. To say he lived a life of significance barely does it justice, and it is not over -- he leaves a profound legacy of hope in a world still wracked by injustice and inequity.CommentsGeorge H. W. BushFormer President of the United StatesI was honored to be the first American President to welcome Mr. Mandela to the White House. It remains a genuine highlight from those four years I was privileged to hold that high office.Comments (22)Kerry KennedyPresident, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsNelson Mandela\u0027s determination and steadfast commitment to equality remains an inspiration to activists and ordinary citizens the world over.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSo how, this shopping season, do you avoid hedonic decline and find the joy not only in the buying, but also in the owning? Below, a few tips for prolonging retail therapy afterglow.CommentsBrian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityFor Mandela, true freedom could only come from forgiveness and a desire to recast the society not from personal or group revenge, but rather from justice, redemption and reconciliation.CommentsRev. Chuck CurrieUnited Church of Christ ministerDeath is not the final victory. Nothing can silence the voice of Nelson Mandela - not Robin Island, not death. His words are eternal. His voice will echo throughout time.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027In the past two days we\u0027ve seen a federal judge rule that Detroit can go bankrupt, putting its workers\u0027 pensions in jeopardy, and we have seen Illinois\u0027 legislature vote for substantial cuts in its retirees\u0027 pensions. Undoubtedly these two actions are just the tip of the iceberg.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorHis narrative began with the widely accepted view that while we don\u0027t expect equal economic outcomes in America, we do strive for equality of opportunity. Of course, that aspiration has been thwarted throughout our history by exclusion, sexism, and racism. But it remains a highly legitimate national goal, and thus fair game for public policy.CommentsColin ColemanManaging Director, Goldman Sachs International Inc.After almost two decades of democracy the world is asking: \"what has Nelson Mandela\u0027s South Africa done with its freedom?\"CommentsBrian DooleyDirector, Human Rights First\u0027s Human Rights Defenders ProgramAs the eulogies for Nelson Mandela begin to appear, it\u0027s the perfect moment to reflect on how the U.S. responded to his calls to end apartheid. Today, just as during the bleak days of apartheid, oppressive regimes imprison and harass human rights activists, Mandela\u0027s spiritual heirs.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorAs leaders of governments and human rights groups from all over the world prepare to attend the funeral of Nelson Mandela in South Africa next week, here is a proposal that would pay worthy tribute to his memory.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageNo politician wants to mention \"redistribution\" because it conjures up images of worthy \"makers\" forced to hand over hard-earned income to undeserving \"takers.\" But as low-wage work proliferates in America, so-called takers are working as hard if not harder than anyone else, and often at more than one job.Comments (212)Vicente Álvarez ArecesFormer President of Asturias, SenatorThat was Mandela\u0027s third visit to Spain, during which he spoke to us about the beginnings of decolonization and the acceptance of the idea that every nation has the right to belong to and participate equitably in the global community. He said that countries cannot be based in the oppression of other nations.CommentsBen OrlinMath teacher, tutor, artistOur World: Still No Scientific Consensus on Global Warming Mathematically Literate World: Still 90 Percent Scientific Consensus on Global WarmingComments (272)Jesse KornbluthEditor of HeadButler.comIf you\u0027re like most Americans, you know that Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison and emerged without hatred to spearhead a peaceful transfer of power in South Africa. But you probably know nothing about the 1995 Rugby World Cup match.CommentsRandy TurnerFormer English teacherI am a 57-year-old with a pacemaker who takes blood pressure medication. I am not exactly the kind of person the health companies enter into bidding wars over.Comments (573)Shannon Bradley-CollearyAging vaintress, wife dominatrix, mom butler and humble author who is slightly mustachioedUnderlying my bid for my daughter\u0027s emotional well-being was the down-and-dirty truth: I wanted her to look pretty in her school pictures, her cascading hair framing her face, so I could show her off to friends and relatives.Comments (330)Trevor NeilsonCo-Founder, Global Philanthropy GroupWith that moral clarity Mandela served 27 years behind bars, mostly on Robben Island, an island prison off of Cape Town where he was subjected to back-breaking labor.CommentsRuby BrowneWriter, runner, cookEssentially everyone I know has worked as a barista, including myself. So I understand that the barista is the unsung hero of the service industry. What I have issue grasping is why people insist on treating the slingers of their drug of choice so poorly.Comments (40)Peter DavisAcademy Award-winning filmmaker, author and journalistWhich one changed America the most -- the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, or the terrorist attacks on New York City and the Pentagon in 2001?CommentsTeresa S. PorterPhotographer, bloggerListen. I hear you. You\u0027re a few pounds heavier than you like. I completely understand how you feel. Isn\u0027t it amazing we can see the beauty in our best friends, sisters, mothers, and aunts without the slightest thought to their flaws... but can obsess for hours on our own imperfections?Comments (54)Michael ShawPublisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesUsing the word \"important\" (as in, \"Most Important\") is less having, or even making, fun than ultimately degrading Michelle Obama and writing her off as a fool.Comments (14)Kate FridkisAuthor of Growing Eden, blogger at Eat the Damn CakeBreastfeeding is not political for me. It\u0027s not a statement. It\u0027s not a battle that I\u0027m fighting in the mythic mommy wars. I don\u0027t even have to tell myself it will cure cancer and make my baby brilliant. I just do it because Eden needs to eat and I need to feed her.Comments (91)Dave PruettFormer NASA researcher; Emeritus Professor of Mathematics, James Madison UniversityPope Francis\u0027 recent encyclical is sending shock waves around the world. In addition to exhortations to the faithful, Evangelii Gaudium (\"The Joy of the Gospel\") packs a scathing critique of \"unbridled\" capitalism and consumerism.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Faith leaders and young Dreamers are joining this historic fast on behalf of immigrant families who suffer because our leaders refuse to address a glaring problem with obvious, common sense solutions. It is politics, and politics only, that stands in the way of progress.CommentsRep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeMy life and my heart were full -- a wonderful husband, three great children, a fantastic job with good benefits -- but in just one day I went from being a perfectly healthy 41-year-old woman to a breast cancer patient.Comments (174)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIt is not surprising that those used to Christianity being the dominant religion in America feel unease in this new reality. So, consider this a primer to help all of us \u0027just get along\u0027 during this \u0027holiday season.\u0027Comments (719)Matthew DowdPolitical strategistLife is a series of falls and rises, mountains and valleys, and pushing and pausing. And as Mandela has shown, our most important years and victories may occur when our hair is gray or gone.CommentsKhnum \u0027Stic\u0027 Ibomu and Scott ShetlerWith all the poppin\u0027 Molly references, sippin\u0027 syrup advocacy, swimming in pools of alcohol advertising, and chronic weed abuse promotion that hip hop has become the modern day vehicle for, it\u0027s refreshing to see health addressed positively from icons of Jay Z and Beyonce\u0027s status.Comments (11)Matthew Dowd, 2013. 5.12Brian Levin, J.D., 2013. 5.12Pete Hegseth, 2013. 5.12Kerry Kennedy, 2013. 5.12Jesse Kornbluth, 2013. 5.12Alex Schattner, 2013. 5.12Ralph Nader, 2013. 5.12Chris Peak, 2013. 5.12Alison Rosen, 2013. 5.12Lester \u0026 Charlie, 2013. 5.12Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"MANDELA IS GONE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
