{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mansur GidfarCommunications Director, Represent.UsFederal law sets certain limits, so you can\u0027t just go write a candidate a check for a million dollars and call it a day. That means you, dear hypothetical rich person, can\u0027t give more than $2,600 to any one candidate per election. Even if you were to donate once in the primary election and again in the general, the absolute most you could give to an individual candidate\u0027s campaign is $5,200. Just giving that much would put you in a very exclusive club. But if you\u0027re part of that 0.08 percent of the population that has money to burn on political giving, why stop at one candidate? Why not dole out $5,000 bucks to a hundred different candidates just to be safe? That\u0027s where McCutcheon v. FEC comes in.This decision could be more radical than modest, increasing the political leverage of the wealthy few and moving us further toward an unregulated political marketplace and away from the democratic republic envisioned by the framers.Thomas E.

Actually, they sit up, bark, and roll over.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Ever since the crisis in Ukraine erupted, the oil and gas industry and its friends in Congress have been pushing exports of gas. This has nothing to do with lofty foreign policy objectives and everything to do with the oil and gas industry using a crisis to ram its agenda through Congress.Mark RuffaloWenonah HauterThe executives at GM knew for 13 years that their cars had a defective ignition switch that would, well, kill people. But they did a \"cost-benefit analysis\" and concluded that paying off the deceased\u0027s relatives was going to be cheaper than having to install a $10 part per car.Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorWhy can\u0027t everyone shut up about Obamacare? Because now the real problems will start to surface.Linda BergtholdHealth policy consultant and bloggerWhen people say hang in there, it will get better, even they don\u0027t believe it.

Her answers and insights reinforce her determination to get the job done.Rana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeThere are literally only a few hundred people who can and will take advantage of this horrendous ruling. But those are exactly the people our elected officials will now be answering to. That is not democracy. It is plutocracy.Robert WeissmanPresident, Public CitizenThey can purchase publicity. They can offer talking points. But they cannot back their diehard delivery with evidence that the Common Core does anything other than divest American public education of its democratically-protected autonomy.Mercedes SchneiderPublic school teacher, education activist, PhDUsing words like \"Ching-Chong\" on a parody show sends the message that slurs like this are all in good fun. But in a world in which racism still exists, these comments are not categorically funny in the same way other satire is.Jessica ProisExecutive Editor of HuffPost Impact, HuffPost Good NewsAfter being tipped off by a subscriber to my Honest Slogans site, it appears that someone has created a counterblog entitled Dishonest Slogans that takes slogans I\u0027ve created and makes them, well, dishonest as opposed to truthful.Clif DickensGraphic DesignerWhen people tell stories rooted in fantasy, they\u0027re called fairy tales.
