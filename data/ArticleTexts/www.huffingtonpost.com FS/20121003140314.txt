{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On the eve of the first presidential debate, the focus shouldn\u0027t be on who is going to \"win,\" but on whether we are finally going to get a serious debate on jobs and the economy. But I don\u0027t expect much, especially given reports the Romney team believes that \"debates are about creating moments\" and thus \"equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized.\" Now, a well-placed debate zinger certainly has its place -- but how much more of a \"moment\" would be created if either candidate instead unleashed a series of proposals to put the twenty million Americans who are unemployed or underemployed back to work? In fact, the pipeline is full of legislative proposals that would help put Americans back to work. But time is running out. If that debate doesn\u0027t happen, then the loser of all three debates will be the American people.Read Post | Comments (165)Alex S. Jones, 10/03/12Director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University’s Kennedy School of GovernmentAs we watch the debate tonight, we can be sure that both candidates have rehearsed prepared lines that they will speak regardless of the questions they are asked. But there will be two actors on the stage and the debate will be to some extent an improvisation where even the best prepared line can prove disastrous.Read Post | CommentsDr. Linda Arnold, 10.01.2012Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Yale School of MedicineThere are many places in the world where parents dare not select their babies\u0027 names in advance. It\u0027s not that these parents love their children less than we do, it\u0027s because they know there is a good chance their babies will die.Read Post | Comments (9)John Dear and John Cusack, 10/02/12Californians have the chance to make history on November 6th. Perhaps then, they might inspire the rest of the country to throw the death penalty in the dust bin where it belongs.Read Post | Comments (125)Keith Thomson, 10/03/12Reporter and authorDuring a 2008 Republican primary debate, moderator Tim Russert asked Mitt Romney, \"Will you do for Social Security what Ronald Reagan did in 1983?\" A disembodied whisper of \"He raised taxes\" followed. Romney appeared to take note before answering Russert, \"I\u0027m not going to raise taxes.\"Read Post | CommentsPatricia Cornwell, 10/02/12If President Obama is reelected, and I hope he is, maybe he should take a close look at those his administration appoints to serve the public objectively and without conflict or unseemly allegiances. And maybe it\u0027s time to hold financial institutions accountable for their greed and questionable practices.Read Post | Comments (97)Robert Reich, 10/02/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027You championed a small version of the Affordable Care Act in Massachusetts.

Why? Because, more than anything else, our kids\u0027 future health and happiness depend on it. And yet, in spite of the many critical issues involved, I\u0027m willing to bet little in the debates will touch on it.Read Post | CommentsShannon Bradley-Colleary, 10/03/12Aging Vaintress, Wife Dominatrix, Mom Butler, Humble Author, Slightly MustachioedBut as I looked up from my vegan menu I was blinded by the vision of a smoking hot, sex Goddess walking through the door.

This is tricky. Acceptable, but it often comes in grayer than the hair on your head and instead of looking \"fashionable\" you look \"homeless\" or \"hung over.\" The one exception is a soul patch.
