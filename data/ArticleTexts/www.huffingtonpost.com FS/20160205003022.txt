{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressWhen political observers characterize New Hampshire, host state of the first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 9, one aspect that they typically focus on is the state\u0027s famed independent-mindedness. That\u0027s a quality that helps make sense of the fact that the two insurgent candidates, Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump, boast big leads in the polls. But there\u0027s another unique thing about Granite State voters that\u0027s worth noting: They always break late. And therein lies the hopes of every candidate with a different surname. Now these two features of the state\u0027s citizens are on a collision course with one another. And if history is any guide, we might wake up next Wednesday with another twist in the tale of this campaign season.Donald Trump alone at his computer makes Richard Nixon\u0027s drunken chats with the portraits of his predecessors seem like models of well-adjusted sanity. Imagine the hell that howls away under that ludicrous coif.Paul Slansky is amassing a memory for Americans allergic to accountability and addicted to amnesia.I dream a world in which all black lives matter. The role of the black queer and trans prophets leading this struggle for liberation is to usher in a new world order full of love, beauty, compassion and empathy.Brooklyn based award-winning media activist and human rights advocate.In her speech claiming victory after the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton proclaimed herself \"a progressive who gets things done.\" I had to laugh. And it wasn\u0027t just because former President Bill Clinton -- the centrist Triangulator-in-Chief -- was standing behind her, beaming and clapping.Author and media criticIt\u0027s time to face the fact that the U.S. mission in Afghanistan has changed significantly since 2001 when Congress passed the authorization for the use of military force there. We simply cannot continue on the current path.U.S. Representative from Massachusetts\u0027 2nd DistrictWithout even knowing a hypothetical Candidate Smith, voters of all parties and demographics would choose Smith, running as an Independent, over Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And Smith beats Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, too.Pollster and strategist in numerous Democratic presidential campaignsHas held senior positions in the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican National CommitteeFounder of Sawyer/MillerIt\u0027s hard to see how any informed political deal can be found without direct input from those battling to hold what\u0027s left of Syrian society together. Putting civil society\u0027s concerns and proposed solutions at the heart of negotiations is essential to producing a sustainable deal.Director, Human Rights First\u0027s Human Rights Defenders ProgramFor me, being different from the rest of the world is one of the most special things about being queer.HuffPost Queer Voices Deputy EditorIf there was ever a time that the American Muslim community needed the words and symbolism of a sitting president\u0027s visit to a mosque, it would be now.Glamour magazineEvolutionary psychology and human mating can help explain why relationships between straight women and gay men tend to flourish.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci Jr., who served separate, decade-long epochs as mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, each punctuated by a felony conviction, died last week at 74. He lorded over only twenty square miles, but across America political junkies smiled and shook their heads at the news. \"F---ing Buddy.\"Communications StrategistIf Coldplay\u0027s \"Hymn for the Weekend\" is the theme music for your upcoming weekend, let us stop you right there. The music video takes the complexity and vastness of Indian culture and squeezes it into the long-romanticized Western narrative of said culture.Programmer, Artist behind Hybrid HuesEnvironmental Analyst, Artist, Indo-Futurist C360Since the 1980s, it\u0027s been used to diminish and discredit efforts to reduce racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, ableism and other forms of discrimination. But despite people like Donald Trump declaring \"I\u0027m so tired of this politically correct crap,\" the efforts remain because the issues have not gone away.Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaOur national optimism sees the schoolhouse as the workhorse of a better tomorrow. By large margins we love our local schools and trust our teachers. We rest comfortably in the belief that our children\u0027s schools look, and feel like, schools of our youth. This is far from today\u0027s reality on the ground.The MacArthur Foundation Chair in Digital Media \u0026 Learning and Chair of the Department of Education at the University of California, Los AngelesThere was a child we will call Meena. She lived in Pakistan. She was a child of energy and initiative. She was six years old when she attempted her first terrorist attack.Author of The Last Thousand: One School\u0027s Promise in a Nation at War, published by St. Martin\u0027s PressThe human medical toll is steadily rising and the community-wide health risk continues -- especially for vulnerable children now facing the threat of life long brain damage from the lead contaminated water.Former SenatorNone of this ever had to happen. But in 2014, an inadequate Republican governor, who is still in power today, tried to cut costs and Flint\u0027s entire water supply was poisoned. This is criminal. We have poisoned our children. American babies. American children. Our own people.Editor-In-Chief of GlobalGrind.comThe western world has a lot of soul searching to do. They should acknowledge their huge responsibility in this crisis, show more solidarity to Greece and step up. Every day that goes by is another day of mourning for humanity.PhotographerMany voters, who have made paid leave a priority, are asking elected officials and candidates my son\u0027s question: \"Why wouldn\u0027t you support this?\" Babies and cancer and ailing parents touch all of us. It\u0027s high time to make family leave available and affordable to every American.Director, Family Values @ WorkWhile progress is possible, it is not inevitable. If we\u0027re going to keep the promise we made in 2012, it\u0027s time to step up and get to work.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationThe Netanyahu government\u0027s linking of national security to the so-called \"defensive borders\" is disingenuous and misleading, designed to provide a cover for his and his cabinet\u0027s continued intoxication with seizing Palestinian territories.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUTo create a world where Black life truly matters, we have to trust that everyone is capable, their spirit is dazzling, and they are deserving of love, no matter where they are in their life transition. To create this, we must empower and trust Black women.Reproductive justice activistTo me, the choice is clear. And the difference now between Hillary and Bernie\u0027s African American support is largely driven by a lack of information. Black people need to know more about Bernie and more about the Clintons\u0027 record.DC native, Tufts grad, Harvard grad, social entrepreneur and Monitor alumThere was an obvious difference in the way my rapist and I had interpreted the incident, and his response gave little indication of any remorse for the irreparable damage done that night. A disturbing thought formed: What if he doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s done?University of Denver Student Body Vice President, writer, activistIn sum, if you\u0027re happy with the status quo, you\u0027ll get plenty of that with Clinton. If you want change, if you\u0027re tired of a \"rigged\" economy and a corrupt political process, Sanders is far more likely to act in your favor. The millions of dollars she has accepted in speaking fees from banks and investment houses, she suggested, would have no impact on her policy decisions, which is simply implausible.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceI don\u0027t know when it happened, but I recently came to realization that I needed to reevaluate my relationship with alcohol. The question I\u0027ve found myself asking lately is, \"When did drinking booze become an obligation?\"Lifestyle Blogger (happilyaudrey.com)Team Hillary clearly wants to pigeon-hole Sanders on one side of the debate hoping to isolate him from Black and Latino voters. But her strategy is likely to fail. As minority voters get to know Sanders better, his message is likely to erode Hillary\u0027s support.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"Six years on, it is time to think more long term, because a generation of young Syrians is in danger of being lost to despair, to violent extremism -- the foundations for peace in the future will erode if this reality is neglected.Director General, UNESCOLabeling all of \"us\" a sexist mob like our beef with Hillary has to do more with her being a woman than our general fears about another moderate, left of center, establishment democrat in office isn\u0027t just unfair, it\u0027s a blinders-on-generalization to defend a flawed candidate.Editor, A PlusPresident Obama just had a very good month in the polls. Not spectacular, mind you, but still better than any month since January of 2015. Essentially, Obama regained the job approval polling ground he lost over the previous two or three months.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThe incontrovertible realities of our physical lives depend on labor -- often that of undocumented immigrants -- that makes apparently endless mundane daily routines possible. This increasingly invisible, underground economy of muscles and sweat, blood and effort intersects in the most intimate ways with those who enjoy the benefits of the virtual world.Professor of History and Coordinator of Latin American Studies at Salem State UniversityGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
