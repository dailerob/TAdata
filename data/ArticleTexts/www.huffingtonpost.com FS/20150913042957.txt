{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersSince the outbreak of civil war in Syria, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict between the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad, equally brutal jihadist groups such as ISIS, and other rebel groups opposed to Assad\u0027s rule. Many refugees from Syria have ended up in neighboring countries, but an increasing number are making often dangerous journeys to reach Europe. What is happening in Europe makes me think about our own country\u0027s hopelessly broken immigration system. There are uncomfortable parallels in the two situations.

We must fight to finally fix a broken system.Today\u0027s topics include: Colbert\u0027s Debut on The Late Show; Christian Sharia Law on the March; Shep Smith for the Win; Sarah Palin\u0027s Incoherent Iran Speech; Huckabee Says Dred Scott is Still the Law of the Land.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027It wasn\u0027t that long ago that the pundits had the 2016 presidential contest pegged as a Clinton-Bush match-up.

Clinton had the same intelligence as Sanders, but made the wrong decision after 9/11.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comBlack lives, a durable fiber of our nation\u0027s history, are also fraying due to stresses beyond the criminal justice system, with many of the root causes directly related to health.Physician, healthcare innovator, and cultural enthusiastSince 9/11, Africa has increasingly been viewed by the Pentagon as a place of problems to be remedied by military means. And year after year, as terror groups have multiplied, proxies have foundered, and allies have disappointed, the U.S. has doubled down again and again.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comThe pattern of violence against minority communities in America does not emerge in a vacuum. It can directly be tied to xenophobic statements our public leaders make against minority and immigrant communities.

If I\u0027ve learned anything in the years since 9/11 (seven of them I was lucky enough to still have my father for), it\u0027s the weight of an \"I love you,\" and the importance of \"How was your day?\"Writer.
