{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Republicans have been disparaging Democrats as socialists -- even centrist ones like Barack Obama -- ever since FDR. So if this be socialism, let\u0027s make the most of it. Sanders and Clinton are both rock solid on civil rights and on LBGT rights. But it\u0027s on the pocketbook issues that Bernie out-flanks Hillary. The fact that he raises his money mainly from small donors while she gets it from the usual suspects underscores the difference. The press also likes to compare Bernie Sanders with Donald Trump. Superficially, both reflect mass frustrations with economic unease and political blockage. But Trump represents know-nothing celebrity politics, while Sanders is actually serious about ideas and policies. What they have in common is the threat that they pose to politics as usual and to the bipartisan elites.The TPP is also a profoundly anti-democratic agreement which signs away our right to govern our own economy. Despite being nominally a \"trade\" agreement, it contains provisions which interfere with areas well beyond the bounds of trade.Author, \u0027Free Trade Doesn\u0027t Work: What Should Replace It and Why\u0027What is in my heart since this morning is that this is completely unacceptable. How can this happen? What is the benefit of this? Destroying a hospital and so many lives, for nothing. I cannot find words for this.Nurse with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)With a stroke of his pen, President Obama can help address one particularly troubling area of dark money spending in elections. He can issue an Executive Order requiring major companies that are awarded federal contracts to disclose all of their political donations.President of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of LawIn between the lines of the glossy pages touched with the Kardashian spell, the Obamas have been blurred out for a family that has not used their stan-factor to offer any substantial social impact in this country.Graduate student, Columbia University Journalism School and Music and Culture writerInterfaith gatherings occur around the country, often in very simple and beautiful ways, but when we need to mobilize against bigotry, how well equipped are we? Where is our rapid response? Where is the determination to stand up every time someone uses religious identity as an excuse to hate?Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostI can cite facts and figures all day long depicting the disparity in which different communities are policed, who gets stopped, who gets frisked, who gets arrested, who can afford an attorney and what actual crime rates are broken down by various categories including race and ethnicity. Bottom line is, our criminal justice system is unbalanced, broken and in need of immediate repair.President, National Action NetworkThe surge of money and enthusiasm propelling Bernie Sanders has long since trampled conventional wisdom. The question now is where that takes us.Novelist and contributing opinion writerThe new Supreme Court term starts today, and sometime this fall the court will consider whether to hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act\u0027s requirement that health insurance provide coverage for contraception without a co-pay. Wait -- didn\u0027t that already happen, you ask?Senior Staff Attorney, ACLU\u0027s Reproductive Freedom ProjectThese Republicans (Trump included) seem totally in agreement that progressive taxation is less effective than light taxation; that it is the scale of public spending and debt which is holding back economic growth, and that it is the burden of taxation to sustain that spending which currently is the key barrier to the generation of private sector-based enterprise and employment.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsOur schools are creating pipelines to violence and incarceration instead of pathways to opportunity and success. Once ensnared, it\u0027s hard to escape from the system; juvenile incarceration is the strongest predictor of adult incarceration.Founding Director of Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth (RJOY)This morning, the White House announced the clinching of a TPP trade deal. Unfortunately, the agreement negotiated by President Obama is completely inadequate to serve the interests of America\u0027s manufacturers, industrial workers, farmers, and other segments of the U.S. economy. President, U.S. Business \u0026 Industry CouncilThe United Nations\u0027 top human rights body torpedoed plans this week for an international inquiry into human rights violations by all parties involved in Yemen\u0027s escalating war, even as an Arab coalition backed by the U.S. carried out its deadliest attack on civilians in the country to date.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.What is among the first actions that brutal totalitarian regimes take upon assuming power? They imprison, exile or \"disappear\" teachers.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Chances are, if you are for gun control, your member of Congress already is for it, too. National petitions don\u0027t do anything. The only way short of a Constitutional re-design of the House is a massive turn out by liberals and a massive lack of turn out by conservatives happening at the same time, leading to a change in the majority in the House.Playwright and Political Science Professor; Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityThis October, anti-Islam extremists are planning roughly 20 anti-Muslim protests in front of mosques in America. With this context, here are five important ways my fellow American Muslims can, and should, respond to these anti-Muslim protests in America.Visiting Fellow, Harvard University\u0027s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal School of Islamic StudiesRepublicans and the rich guys who imposed 35 years of stagnant wages on American workers now offer a prescription for easing this pain! More free stuff for corporations!International President, United SteelworkersIn the space of just a few days my life had completely unraveled. A trapdoor had opened beneath me. I no longer struggled to get up. I stopped getting dressed.Author of \u0027Black Rainbow\u0027Amy Schumer, Steph Curry, Ed Norton, Jesse Williams, Chris Pine, Russell Simmons, and Piper Kerman are among the nearly 100 celebrities calling for reform to our criminal justice system.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceI have no doubt that Dr. Carson is a fantastic surgeon, and I highly encourage him to keep doing what he\u0027s good at, what made him famous, what made him loved and what kept him far too busy--presumably and understandably--to read the United States Constitution.Author, Attorney, Activist, UN Global ExpertIf \"pro-life\" Republicans want fewer abortions, they have decisions of their own to work out. Every woman is the captain of her own ship -- the pilot of her own plane -- and equipped to make decisions about the health, safety and security of herself and any passengers.Civil rights lawyer; former state senator, writerDirected by James Vanderbilt, Truth tells the story of 2004\u0027s controversial 60 Minutes II broadcast questioning George W. Bush\u0027s military service record. It stars Robert Redford as Dan Rather and Cate Blanchett as producer Mary Mapes. This time, Truth prevails.Author, consultant, Director, Progress Texas PACThe power of painkillers is that they come in amber pill bottles, not little plastic bags. Their precise, factory-shaped contours make it easy for people -- even doctors -- to believe they aren\u0027t addictive. But the painkiller epidemic and the heroin epidemic are one and the same. And their addictions are equally horrific.Author, \u0027American Pain\u0027National infrastructure legislation would create thousands more jobs than the myth of the so-called Keystone Jobs Bill. Improving infrastructure means we\u0027re building things that last and spending money and creating jobs around the country. We\u0027re spreading and sharing the wealth.Founder, Practically RepublicanThe shame of being divorced twice before 30 drained my will to live.Writer, crafter, sometimes lawyer, aspiring vegetarian, nature lover, hopeful hippie, Progressive, introvert, hiker, anxiety warriorSince Republicans gained control of Congress little has been done. The Arbitration Act, which would broadly void forced arbitration contracts, has languished in Congress for six years. A bill to prohibit any school receiving federal student aid from restricting students\u0027 ability to pursue legal claims in court likely will not come to a vote.Director, The Public Good Initiative, Institute for Local Self-RelianceIn short, the injustice of mass incarceration is something everyone should be aware of and talking about. The impact it is having not only on inmates but also on their partners and families is a discussion we cannot continue to leave out.Writer and teacher based in the Bay Area. Stanford University BA, University of Cambridge MPhil - Specializes in Race and Gender Studies.Normally it\u0027s unusual to see a White House official member joking with a member of Aerosmith, but this day was a coupling of pop stars, government leadership and average people who have formed a cooperative trifecta -- the first organized national response to addiction in this country\u0027s history.Cardiac Surgeon and Host of the Emmy-Award Winning \u0027The Dr. Oz Show\u0027The goal of #RiseUpOctober is to bring together people from all walks of life to manifest our moral determination in the public square: police terror must stop now.Who speaks for Americans? To whom must Congress respond? Is it their constituents or their donors and lobbyists? It\u0027s time for that debate RFK tried to start in 1968. It\u0027s time for Americans to decide what kind of society they want. It\u0027s what the framers intended.Publisher, the-environmentalist.orgI\u0027m voting for Bernie in large part because he is able to communicate his thoughts without consulting a team of advisers and without apologizing for his value system. Most importantly, Sanders never had to contradict himself because of political pressure, especially since the Vermont Senator has been on the right side of history.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
