{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Our society is at least four times as rich as it was when my dad came home from the war. Far too much of that national wealth is going to the wrong people -- bankers and speculators who not only don\u0027t earn their wealth but who caused a great recession for everyone else. My dad didn\u0027t go to college; he was the first member of his family to own a house thanks to the GI bill (no housing scandals of that era -- these were direct government loans), and he was part of a rising, hard-working middle class. My kids and grandkids didn\u0027t suffer the Great Depression, nor did they have to slog across Normandy or serve time in a German POW camp. But they face a stunted future. My father\u0027s generation did not make their sacrifices only so that their great-grandchildren would be the stunted generation.The idea that the richest man in America can purchase and -- working closely with the U.S. Department of Education -- impose new and untested academic standards on the nation\u0027s public schools is a national scandal. A Congressional investigation is warranted.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027In observing World Oceans Day yesterday, we recognized that protecting our ocean is not a luxury. It is a necessity that contributes to our economy, our climate and our way of life.U.S. Secretary of StateWhile styling themselves as defenders of the constitution and protectors of individual rights, hardline GOPers, in practice, protect their own power and position by violating the Constitution and denying individuals their rights. Just take North Carolina for example.International President, United SteelworkersAs if it weren\u0027t enough that some of the Republican Party\u0027s leaders were breaking with the party on this issue, now their loudest talking point is being undermined by the very people the Republican Party pretends to speak for in its opposition to raising the minimum wage: businesses and large corporations.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorWhen I hear someone talking with disgust about people who receive public assistance, well, that person is talking about me, too. And themselves. And everyone in this country who\u0027s been able to build themselves and their families a financially-prosperous life.Spotlighting all things class-related at risksomething.weebly.comWhen Obama announced plans to curtail the use of coal over the next 15 years, news outlets rushed to do pieces on the prospective loss of jobs in coal-mining areas. While it is good to see the media paying attention to this job loss and its implications for families and communities, this concern is a striking departure from normal practice.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Basketball is more than just a game; it is representative of what goes on in our nation on a larger scale. In so many areas we see businesses and corporations making tremendous profits from black buying power -- which is projected to reach $1.1 trillion in 2015. But how often do we see those same entities recruiting, hiring, and promoting from this same constituency?President, National Action NetworkAngel Belle was alive during the entire delivery process. My wife felt her kicking throughout. Her heartbeat was strong. And then it was not. After being delivered, Angel Belle took a single breath while her heartbeat slowly faded.Marketing Creative Manager, Center Theatre GroupIt was one of those 3 a.m. ideas that I had to act on. And that was to go paleo... for a week. Could I handle this almost-absurd change in my diet?Blog editor, The Huffington PostNot too long ago in our recent past there used to be TV shows -- entertainment, we called it -- and we also had the news. More serious, not worthy of high ratings -- informative, you might say. Now we have entertaining news, not entertainment news like Entertainment Tonight, but a soap opera version of the news.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producer\"Divide and conquer\" is a venerable political adage. The Obama administration has taken a different, quite novel course in dealing with rivals: \"consolidate and strengthen.\" Washington has performed this feat in a manner that quickly has borne fruit. How and with what implications?Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghI\u0027ve always regarded asteroids as somewhat like dinosaurs: mildly interesting and faintly dangerous. But I\u0027m now thinking that they might be a profitable real estate investment.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteWhen the right drops the C-bomb, the M-bomb and S-bomb all at once, you can be certain a book is having an impact. And \"Capital\" may well be the \"General Theory\" of the first half of the 21st century, redefining the way we think about capitalism, democracy and equality.WriterThe idea that women should be able to share non-sexually objectifying images of their bodies, a form of counter-speech to our pervasive sexual objectification, eludes many people, who seem to skim the surface of what the core issues are.Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderYou woke up to a fresh new day full of possibilities. You woke up to an abundance of opportunities and passion. Follow these simple steps that will have you greeting the day with love, excitement and happiness.Writer, Artist and Whole Living Guide http://www.rebmckown.comVisit an Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie or Free People clothing store, and you\u0027re likely to think, \"They know their market.\" Yet Urban Outfitters, which owns all three stores, has leaders who are so out of touch that for years they have refused to have a policy to even consider having women and minorities on its board of directors.Connecticut State TreasurerSteak on the outdoor grill: It\u0027s the iconic summer meal, and doing it to perfection is an art that every man must master.CEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeSome of the most famed faux pas of the past are also turning up on fashionable faces in the beauty realm, from matte finishes to matching lipstick to blue eyeliner.Makeup artistWhy is this Instagrammer hell-bent on \"proving\" that people are lying about what they consume? Picking on individual people for images they uploaded of meals or treats they\u0027re about to enjoy sounds a lot like shaming.Associate Editor, HuffPost WomenI thought Karl Rove\u0027s 2004 Swift Boating of John Kerry\u0027s Vietnam service record in the US Navy was pretty disgusting, but the recent smears against President Barack Obama for winning Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl\u0027s release have descended to a new low.Professor, historian, authorThis is big. This isn\u0027t Amazon, it\u0027s Amazon x100. Very social, very local and very efficient.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEI see the young people with their beautiful faces full of hope, intelligent and bright, most of them a lot more knowledgeable (I am not saying experienced) than a lot of people highly placed in the expiring government. They are all waiting, hoping, expecting, and maybe dreaming of the role some of them might play with a bright and shiny, brand new Afghan government.Soccer, metaphor for war, at times turns into real war. Then \"sudden death\" is no longer just a name for a dramatic way of deciding a tied match. As often occurs with religion, patriotism, and politics, soccer can bring tensions to a boil, and many horrors are committed in its name.Author, \u0027Children of the Days: A Calendar of Human History\u0027Then along came Anita Bryant with her Save Our Children crusade and enough was enough. This kid, steeped in Bible-believing, conservative fundamentalism, sat down and wrote a letter to the newspaper denouncing Bryant\u0027s intolerance. To say the least, it was noticed.President, Moorfield Storey InstituteThe richest and most powerful nation that the world has ever known can certainly design a social support system that is both humane and fair. The richest and most powerful nation that the world has ever seen can certainly afford to feed, house and cloth all its citizens.Statistician and health economist for the United Nations; Teacher, Columbia UniversityProgressive evangelicalism helped propel Carter to the White House. But another group of evangelicals, who eventually coalesced into a movement known as the Religious Right, began agitating to deny Carter, their fellow evangelical, a second term.Chair, Religion Department, Dartmouth CollegeThe partisan divide on climate change didn\u0027t arise in a vacuum. Despite the substantial differences in political ideology between affiliates of the two major parties that existed during the Clinton years, there was relatively little difference in their level of acceptance of the science of climate change.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027BSN assumes that a) man-made carbon is accelerating warming \u0026 b) the Bergdahl swap was a 51-49 decision. Within these boundries, Lowry/Reagan clash over the EPA rule\u0027s \"war on coal\" and the price we paid to bring home the Afghan War\u0027s last American POW. In both, Obama acts on \"Yes we can\" while GOP critics say \"Yes but.\"Why does GOP enthusiasm for the tea party senator translate into another Clinton in the Oval Office?Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications.To pick one result, while ignoring this \"big picture\" is to \"miss the forest for the trees.\" Pointing out a result is as easy as finding a number on a chart. But understanding the meaning of that result is the key to making sense of this or any poll.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"STUDENT LOAN GIANT ACCUSED OF CHEATING TROOPS COULD GET $1 BILLION GOV\u0027T CONTRACT",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
