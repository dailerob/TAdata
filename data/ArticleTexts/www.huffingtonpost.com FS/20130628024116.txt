{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe shrewdest, most manipulative and radical politician in this city isn\u0027t the president or a member of Congress. He\u0027s the chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, John G. Roberts Jr. Roberts assured the nation during his 2005 confirmation hearing that he would be an umpire of constitutional law, but instead he has become the cleanup hitter, manager and team owner. In a now familiar two-step of jurisprudence, the Roberts Court on Wednesday tactically ceded ground it did not regard as crucial -- this time, on two gay rights cases. But politically, these tolerant rulings on the country\u0027s social fabric deflect attention from the Roberts Court\u0027s deeper goal: to remove the federal government as an impediment to corporate, state and local power.Comments (1,799)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowHere\u0027s a fantastic example of cognitive dissonance. On Tuesday, Republicans continued their collective screeching about the rapidly fizzling IRS non-scandal and how the government unfairly targeted conservatives, while also applauding a ruling which allows Republican-controlled states to deliberately target and disenfranchise Democrats.Comments (48)Dr. Martin KohnChief Medical Scientist for IBM ResearchSince Jeopardy!, Watson has become 240 percent faster and 75 percent smaller. Watson can now run on a single server, which is the size of four stacked pizza boxes, onsite or through the cloud. And that\u0027s why organizations can start bringing Watson into their operations as an assistant, to help sift through the information they\u0027re collecting, learn from that data and how it\u0027s been applied in the past, and provide specific suggestions quickly and efficiently.Comments (8)Rachel FarrisNative Texan, Political Hobbyist, Rick Perry ObserverI have been asked if it was planned. The truth is this: When you have no words left, when every word spoken has fallen on deaf ears, when the representative you have chosen to speak is no longer allowed to do so, sometimes all there is left to do is scream.Comments (207)Murray LippSocial justice activistAs two major Supreme Court decisions about same-sex marriage (Proposition 8 and DOMA) loom on the horizon, it\u0027s an opportune time to refocus attention on the many advantages associated with the pursuit and achievement of marriage equaility.Comments (837)Alisa WellekDeputy Director, Immigrant Defense ProjectThe final Senate vote on the immigration bill has just been cast. This is a historic moment for the United States, but there remain serious problems with this flawed bill as it stands today.Comments (30)Julia StilesActressIt\u0027s customary now for people to exchange social media accounts instead of phone numbers, even if there is romantic interest. It\u0027s less risky, too. Courtship in the virtual world allows for a somewhat imaginary exchange, full of connection and surprise, but always at a distance.Comments (21)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoFor a state to deny same-sex couples the freedom to marry plainly violates the constitutional guarantee that no state shall deny to any person \"the equal protection of the laws.\"Comments (149)Annette Bernhardt and Haeyoung YoonAs the spotlight shifts to the House of Representatives, there will be intensive debate that could profoundly reshape the bill and destroy its promise. Here are three elements of the Senate bill that we believe will determine whether immigration reform works for the U.S. economy.Comments (33)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The words above the Supreme Court read, \"Equal Justice Under the Law.\" This week, two Supreme Court outcomes dramatically affected the reality of those words.Comments (41)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolCNN and MSNBC are giving wall-to-wall coverage to the Trayvon Martin murder trial. Fox News is taking brief breaks to empathize with Darrell Issa and Paula Deen, but otherwise the cable news channels are all race-crime-porn all the time. They have three good reasons for doing this.Comments (34)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundThe fact of the matter is, here in Texas, we\u0027ve started something no one can stop. People don\u0027t want politicians making women\u0027s private medical decisions, cutting off access to lifesaving preventive care or safe and legal abortion -- and they absolutely will not stand for it.Comments (418)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostIn honor of the Sunday premiere of Showtime\u0027s Ray Donovan, let\u0027s all take an Anti-Hero Pop Quiz! Because everyone knows pop quizzes are fun!CommentsRobert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureWhy gouge the kids taking on debt to stay in school and not the corporations secreting profits abroad to avoid taxes? Clearly corporate lobbies and contributions speak louder in the corridors of power than students and their families.Comments (78)Jeff CohenAuthor and media criticWhen a huge swath of the country is on the side of the guy-on-the-run and not the government, it\u0027s much easier to see that there\u0027s nothing \"objective\" or \"neutral\" about journalists who so closely identify with the spy agencies or Justice Department or White House.Comments (331)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The best way to stay safe is to aggressively protect yourself. No one else can guard your email better than you. Here are the top 11 things you can do right now to reduce your risk of getting your email either hacked or scammed.Comments (16)Eli LehrerPresident, R StreetThere\u0027s little doubt that the decisions herald an unstoppable trend towards full legal equality for same-sex relationships. Once that\u0027s established, the fundamental reasons for gay Americans to vote as they do will vanish.Comments (27)Murray FromsonFromsonfile.comI vividly remember that bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge leading out of Selma, Alabama when some 600 civil rights marchers heading for the state capitol in Montgomery were stopped by club-wielding state troopers, deputy sheriffs and other hired hands.Comments (21)Glennon MeltonBlogger, MomasteryI love my gay friends, without agenda. And I love my friends who believe that homosexuality is a sin, without agenda.Comments (382)Rep. Rush HoltU.S. Congressman from New Jersey\u0027s 12th districtIf federal authorities want to see the data of an American citizen, they should be forced to come through the front door -- and only with a court order based on probable cause, as our Founders intended.Comments (29)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWith the overturning of DOMA, it will simply be easier for states to embrace marriage equality and move past intolerance. It now becomes harder to push anti-gay policies, because there is no incentive to do so under federal law. Today is a dark day for the forces of anti-gay bigotry.Comments (114)Sophie WadeCEO and Founder of Flexcel Network, LLCWhat does success mean? What are our \u0027life ambitions\u0027 -- corporate, family and more? As we start to engage proactively in these questions, flexibility -- the ability to have some choice and control over our combination of life activities -- is a critical part of the future solution.CommentsDee ReesScreenwriter and Director, PariahWhat does is matter if I can marry my girlfriend when our other brothers and sisters won\u0027t be able to vote? How can rights be granted to one part of my being while the rights to the other be curtailed? What sort of cruel hypocrisy is this?CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerTwo choices, my American friends. Either you cling to the anarcho-capitalism that brought us all to the brink in 2008 -- or you admit that our fight is your fight, too, and that in defending the cultural exception, France is pleading not for France but for the world.Comments (24)Jennifer Bradley and Bruce KatzCities and metropolitan areas -- and the networks of individuals and institutions helming them -- are becoming our national leaders: experimenting, taking risks, and making hard choices to reinvent their economies and embrace their rapidly diversifying populations. This metropolitan revolution is at the cutting edge of reform, investment, and innovation.CommentsRahm EmanuelMayor of Chicago, ILCities can drive dramatic improvements on climate but we can\u0027t do it alone. As the Mayor of Chicago, I see the both the benefits of tackling this challenge and the threats that remain.Comments (49)Todd GitlinProfessor of Journalism and Sociology, Columbia UniversitySome intriguing bits about informers and agents provocateurs briefly made it into the public spotlight when Occupy Wall Street was riding high. But as always, dots need connecting.CommentsEduardo J. Padrón, Ph.D.President, Miami Dade CollegeThere is another notion, another word that is essential to the conversation about America. The word is service, and it too has been institutionalized, primarily around the military. But it also has roots in our need to express our connection to each other, to bind the social order.CommentsDonna HighfillWriter, Coach, Humorist, and Change ConsultantIf you were a peddler who rolled into town with your cart and offered a trade -- hot flashes for a newborn screaming at 2:00 a.m. -- I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d make that trade. Instead, I would peer into your cart and see if you might have some nice pans or petticoats or perty trinkets instead.Comments (22)H. Alan ScottWriter, Comedian, Fresca enthusiastHe\u0027s not into me, or at least not yet. I\u0027m totally into him, at least for now. \"I\u0027m damaged. But u are amazing,\" he texts. Saying \"I\u0027m damaged,\" to somebody with cancer is like saying, \"Nobody sees me,\" to a blind person.Comments (13)Peggy NolanChief Executive Stepmom, The Stepmom\u0027s ToolboxWhen you break up with over-thinking it\u0027s like writing your own \"get out of jail free\" card. It doesn\u0027t cost you anything to end your relationship with the drama inside your head. You can decide to focus on things in the present that are deserving of your time and attention whenever you choose.Comments (63)Eduardo PaesMayor, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilThe voices of the streets represent a unifying message -- these events must prioritize legacy and what will remain after the race is run and the final whistle blows. If not, the shareholders won\u0027t even reach the qualifiers, let alone the players.CommentsRep.
