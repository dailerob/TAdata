{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Again and again in 2011, as the country sat mired in crises and the long-term effects of joblessness, declining wages, and downward mobility, the response by the governing class could not have been more disproportionate to the problems. Like a terrible reality show, each week brought some fresh, completely made-up five-alarm crisis. And the media would dutifully follow suit, breathlessly giving its attention to the latest make or break negotiations in Washington. And then would come the front-page breakthrough deal that would essentially maintain the status quo. Instead of this manufactured Beltway clown show, there are very real and growing problems the media could be putting the spotlight on.
