{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe Israelis and Palestinians have been trapped for decades between delusions and denial and both have resorted to ideological and religious dogmas that dismiss with conviction any factual evidence to the contrary. It is these delusions that have tragically perpetuated the conflict; their actions and reactions to each other\u0027s transgressions only validate these delusions. Thus, little room is left for any bilateral constructive discourse as suspicion, hatred, and distrust became deeply embedded in their respective public psyches, creating psychological, political, and physical divides. Not surprisingly, this sad state of affairs is now glaringly manifested, once again, by the war between Israel and Hamas.I was raised to be against any act of violence, and the consequent suffering of humanity for it, regardless of religions, ethnicities and borders.Academy Award-winning actorGiven the choice between immigrants entering the U.S. with a path to citizenship or Hannity and Perry with their smirky, middle-aged white itchy trigger fingers, faux badassery and gun fetishes, I\u0027ll take the immigrants in a heartbeat. So should we all.Managing Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIs the conflict tearing this new nation apart actually a proxy fight between the world\u0027s two top economic and military powers? That\u0027s the way South Sudan\u0027s Information Minister, Michael Makuei Lueth, tells it.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comThe fight to renew unemployment insurance has always been about those who are most affected.

If we\u0027re going to argue that Dorfman has the right to sleep with whomever she wants without shame, we can\u0027t react as if Viall was wrong to call her out on it.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarPeroutka has been under fire for months for his involvement in and leadership of the League of the South, a white nationalist group that advocates conservative, Christian theocracy and secession to form a Southern Republic.

What is more striking, however, is that a missile intentionally launched by someone shot down a civilian aircraft carrying numerous EU citizens amongst its passengers and somehow we have reacted as if it was due to a storm or a little bird inside of one of the motors.Adviser, European Parliament and political analystYou\u0027ve got to wonder what would motivate creatures from other worlds to suffer a journey of hundreds of trillions of miles to visit our planet? Why bother? I\u0027ve been asked this question at least a half-dozen times by Hollywood writers, and the best answer I can muster is \"I don\u0027t know.\"Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteWe continue talk about white kids as if they are colorblind. We do this 1) as if this were true and 2) as if (if it were true) this were a good thing. Meanwhile, neither of these things is the case.Associate Professor of Religion, Drake UniversityAs discerning analysts like Nate Silver have been noticing, there\u0027s a particularly large gap between elite and popular opinion on marijuana policy. It\u0027s long past time to close that gap. Marijuana legalization is far from a risky position -- in fact, it\u0027s smart politics.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceAre you \"pro-Israel\" or \"pro-Palestine\"?

No, let me amend that. If you think some things should be off limits, let\u0027s sit down together and discuss that proposition itself. Let\u0027s not just insult each other and cut off all discussion because we rationalists have somehow wandered into a land where emotion is king.Biologist and writerI\u0027ve been writing an advice column in some shape or form for close to 10 years now, and I can say with confidence that at least 75 percent of the letters I receive from married people are about issues that could have been avoided if the couples had better communicated their expectations about married life before tying the knot.Relationship advice columnist at DearWendy.comFrom our conversation, I knew I had to stop sitting still.

But there are, in fact, deficits that demand immediate attention.Dean, Congressional Black Caucus | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeThis week, working people made some hugely significant gains as the fruits sowed by organizing efforts, lawsuits, legislative action -- and above all, workers standing up for themselves despite tremendous risk -- began to be visible.Senior Policy Analyst at DemosEvery 6-year-old in Gaza is now living through the third war in their life.
