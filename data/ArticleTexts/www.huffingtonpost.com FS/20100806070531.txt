But then I came to realize that I have to make this decision for them, especially for my daughter, as much as for myself and my country.Read Post | CommentsGeoffrey R. Stone, 08.05.2010Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of ChicagoIt is no surprise that judges sometimes take positions in support of the liberties of vulnerable minorities -- even in the face of often fierce majority opposition. Indeed, that is precisely what our judges are supposed to do.Read Post | CommentsDennis A. Henigan, 08.05.2010Brady Center Vice President and Author of \"Lethal Logic\"There is no question that we need to devote far more resources to enforcing federal gun laws. But it is a transparent fallacy to argue that deficiencies in enforcing current laws justify inaction to strengthen those laws.Read Post | CommentsMarvin Ammori, 08.05.2010Law Professor/Advocate in CyberlawThe Google-Verizon deal proves that network neutrality rules are necessary. And it proves that the FCC\u0027s negotiation-talks receive little respect from the corporations engaged in them (maybe for good reason).Read Post | CommentsLincoln Mitchell, 08.05.2010Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityThe notion that increasing the tax rate on the richest Americans means the socialist floodgates have been opened is clearly nonsensical, as the rates would return to what was normal for most of the last half century.Read Post | CommentsBryan Safi, 08.05.2010Staff writer, Current TVYou know what\u0027s gay? Sissy commercials.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 08.05.2010Author, The Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to BeThe issue of net neutrality and democratic media was where Obama was the most unequivocally good on the campaign trail.

It\u0027s a subject practically off-limits in the media and American policy circle.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 08.05.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureAs we look back on the last two years of Wall Street misbehavior it seems reasonable to ask the question: What\u0027s a banker gotta do to get arrested in this town?Read Post | CommentsJanine R. Wedel and Linda Keenan, 08.05.2010There\u0027s taxpayer money going into the hands of the very people attacking U.S. troops and the contractors who risk their lives for a paycheck. 260 of those workers took that risk and lost over the last year, and their names will likely never be known.Read Post | CommentsSam Seder, 08.05.2010IronistRead Post | CommentsHarry Moroz, 08.05.2010Researcher, Drum Major Institute for Public PolicyLess than one percent of stimulus spending went directly to cities because cities are \"lowest\" in the federal hierarchy.

That\u0027s all about to change.Read Post | CommentsMegan Tady, 08.05.2010Blog Editor and Video Producer, Free PressBut blaming Google for finding ways to deepen their own pockets is like blaming a tiger for eating a goat. It\u0027s ultimately up to the FCC to protect Net Neutrality, and we need to hold them and our lawmakers accountable to us.Read Post | CommentsPhilip Smucker, 08.05.2010Author of the new book My Brother, My Enemy: America and the Battle of Ideas across the Islamic WorldA strange tale from the remote Spice Islands seems oddly prescient today, particularly as I think of the cataclysmic violence that rocked New York City nearly nine years ago.Read Post | CommentsAlon Ben-Meir, 08.05.2010Senior Fellow at NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsWhile the world reacts to the recent flair-up of violence along the Lebanon-Israel border, other developments in the area could present an opportunity to advance regional peace if pursued.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 08.04.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowThe press, government officials and BP pitchmen are insulting our intelligence by suggesting that the oil has vanished and there\u0027s nothing to worry about. They can whistle away the crisis as much as they want, but we\u0027d all do well to stay on top of this.Read Post | CommentsWilliam K. Black, 08.05.2010Assoc.

Today, though, bold gestures seem to be winning the struggle.Read Post | CommentsTom Engelhardt, 08.05.2010Editor of TomDispatch.comIf blowback comes to the United States, and the first suicide drones arrive, everyone will be deeply puzzled and angered, but one thing is certain, we will not consider any damage done to our society \"collateral\" damage.Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 08.05.2010Political organizer, strategist and author2010 does not have to be an electoral disaster for Democrats.
