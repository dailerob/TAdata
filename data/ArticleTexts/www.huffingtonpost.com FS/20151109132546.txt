{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Even though Yellen is far more sensitive to the need for job and wage growth than most Fed chairs, she is just one vote out of twelve voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). And the Fed is running true to form: As soon as the recovery starts trickling down to regular working people, time to apply the brakes. As I\u0027ve written in previous posts, several factors are at work here. First, many top officials at the Fed are far more orthodox than Yellen. She has struggled to keep a working majority on the FOMC as the money markets and the conventional wisdom have clamored, with increasing intensity, for a rate hike. That said, even if the Fed kept interest rates at effectively zero for another year, it\u0027s increasingly clear that monetary policy alone is not sufficient to get unemployment rates down to where they need to be -- or to translate falling jobless rates into raises for workers.The Shanghai Propaganda Poster Art Center should be on the \"to see\" list of anyone visiting the city. You\u0027ll be simultaneously fascinated and appalled by what the Chinese have gone through--and thankful that you have not!Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIn the kerfuffle over presidential candidate Ben Carson\u0027s claim that he was admitted to West Point, the news media have pointed out that the \"full scholarship\" part of his story adds even more confusion because, as the New York Times story today put it, \"Technically, West Point does not offer scholarships. It is free.\" Actually, no, West Point and the other military academies are not free, technically or otherwise.Senior Fellow at The Century Foundation; former education official in the Obama and Clinton AdministrationsThe rejection of the Keyston XL Pipeline revealed not only the gigantic chasm between environmentalists and industry, it also laid bare the ugly side of American politics where common sense often dies a slow, painful death.Energy Veteran and Author, Founder, this-small-planet.comI\u0027m alive and I\u0027m a person. I don\u0027t like when a**holes tell me to smile. I don\u0027t like being told to be quiet, and I don\u0027t like having to turn the other cheek because strangers on the Internet could light me up all day long because they don\u0027t like big mean feminists. You don\u0027t get to make me afraid.Founder, Still Kickin; Author, \u0027It’s Okay To Laugh (Crying’s Cool Too)\u0027You might not want to harm trans people, but that\u0027s the thing about casual transphobia; It doesn\u0027t need to have true hate behind it to be real and harmful.Vlogger, Indie Model, Trans Advocate, Nerd, Artist, Musician, Proud Feminist SlutAmerica and Israel have far more in common than the critics care to mention. Next week -- when the leaders shake hands -- it will be an opportunity to remind the world of the shared interests that bind the two nations.National Director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation LeagueIt is a fallacy that the pervasive rates of assaults are perpetrated by a few bad seeds. The truth of the matter is that most sexual offenders on college campuses are friends or acquaintances of their victims. They could be my friends, or my friends\u0027 friends. So if we are to assume that rape is being perpetrated by sometimes intelligent, friendly, even nice men, there must be other issues at hand.Master of Public Policy student at Harvard Kennedy School, passionate about conflict resolution and gender equality.Such weaponry could potentially be used against Iran, should Israel feel a need in the future. More immediately, however, Israel\u0027s new arms package makes its military an even more dangerous killing machine against the defenseless Palestinian population in the occupied territories.Executive director, The Jerusalem FundBy overtly politicizing the issue, the activists may have further polarized attitudes about climate change and moved the country closer to a scenario in which climate change is considered a Democratic issue, while opposition to climate-friendly policies becomes a litmus test for Republicans.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.I intended to put into practice what I tell my students -- that the best way to learn is to talk with people who disagree you. I wanted to learn from red America, and hoped they\u0027d also learn a bit from me (and perhaps also buy my book). But something odd happened. It turned out that many of the conservative Republicans and Tea Partiers I met agreed with much of what I had to say -- and I agreed with them.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027We feel like we have done all of the things that we are supposed to do to be successful, accepted and respected. We are liked by the people who know us. We are thought of as good people and great neighbors -- but what about the person who doesn\u0027t know us? Even when you\u0027re a so-called \"good black,\" you still have to prepare yourself for all of the indignities of daily life as a black person in America.Award-Winning Tax Attorney, Donafy App Co-Founder, Motivational Speaker and Advocate for the PoorAs Syrian refugees near their fifth year of displacement and peace in their homeland is nowhere close, a question was raised recently in a Washington, D.C. newspaper for Congressional staffers: \"Will Syrians become the new Palestinians?\" Consider the case of Palestinians in Lebanon.Young Palestinian writers from Gaza and LebanonThe GOP race has Ben Carson and Donald Trump leading the pack. It really is becoming more bizarre. Carson is offended that some people don\u0027t believe him when he claims he attempted to take a hammer to his dear old mom, stab a friend, and throw a rock at another fellow. What?Attorney, Correspondent, ProvocateurChildren desperately need adults to help them process and cope within the violent and uncertain world we have created for them. They also need to see adults working with and for them to create a better, safer nation and world for tomorrowPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundI was an awkward nerd with more of an interest in skate-punk than hip-hop. Not fitting in with the other black kids was tough, but being queer put even more stress on my relationship to my blackness.Voices Editorial FellowFor over two decades, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been playing us for fools--a role we have filled to the detriment of our national honor and the cause of peace.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Ready or not, the holiday season is in full swing: The neighborhood decorations are up, the festive music is playing and the Black Friday commercials are running.

We both went into our own directions but kept in contact and then I received the call. Eddie called me to inform me he was not gay. I remember thinking that this was a lost Queen and there was no way that he was straight.Fashion MarketingAll sorts of technological, legal and regulatory barriers must be addressed for AVs to deliver their full potential. But these barriers aren\u0027t higher than those encountered in the shift from horses to conventional cars.John L. Weinberg/Goldman Sachs \u0026 Co. Visiting Professor at Princeton University\u0027s Woodrow Wilson SchoolI think there are plenty of reasons to oppose national standards no matter what standards they are, and plenty of reasons to believe that no set of national standards will ever accomplish any of the goals set for them. But let\u0027s set all of that aside for a moment and talk about how the very attempt to assess standards-based outcomes ruins those standards.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comNot knowing any better, I\u0027d tried to make their holiday favorites \"just the way I used to\" when their dad and I were married. But as we sat, looking at a turkey so large it threatened to collapse the table, it occurred to me that what I was holding on to was hurting all of us.Author of The Cave trilogy.

Learn from others. Adult together.If you were given too much, you may overly depend upon other people to fill you up and make you happy and become angry and abandoning when the world doesn\u0027t shift on its axis to give you what you want when you want it. When you have never been made to be responsible for sustaining your own well-being you become emotionally immature and demanding.Veteran, licensed PsychologistI hate insurance companies. I loathe their existence. They serve no purpose other than to make their shareholders happy and their executives rich. They are the reason that healthcare is a losing battle in this country.Blogger, entrepreneur and mom of two girls. Author of Doorways to Arkomo and Doorways Home.Instead of treating recess as an important, in fact crucial, part of a student\u0027s day, some schools still act as if recess is a privilege bestowed on well-behaved, compliant students.
