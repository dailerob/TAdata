{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Director of the Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceTrayvon Martin\u0027s father, Tracy, recently told reporters of his son\u0027s murder: \"There is no justice in this.\" And even if George Zimmerman were ultimately to be convicted, Tracy Martin will still be right, because his son will still be lost to him as a result of ill-advised and reckless changes to Florida law in the past. Meanwhile, the NRA continues its push to arm civilians by liberalizing the use of lethal force. Four states now allow citizens to carry loaded guns in public with no permitting, screening or training. Until this lethal agenda is countered by Americans of conscience, the inevitability of future Trayvon Martins will hang over America like a funeral shroud.Read Post | Comments (744)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 03/20/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves.

Yet our election system is mired in the past. We can rescue our election system from the horse-and-buggy era and infuse it with the dynamism of our digital age. It\u0027s happening now.Read Post | Comments (73)Vicky Shorr, 03/20/12Co-founder of Archer SchoolYou see it in every drug ad, and in a lot of the articles in the New York Times Science Section: \"Talk to your doctor.\" \"This is between you and your doctor.\" \"If you experience bleeding, memory loss, black-outs, tell your doctor,\" and so on.

But surely the best way to promote any such agenda is not to deny what virtually every sane historian on the planet has come to conclude.Read Post | Comments (1,976)Ethan Rome, 03/20/12Executive Director, Health Care for America NowThe GOP budget is an immoral and callous clarion call for the middle class to pay more and get less. It promotes prosperity for the few instead of opportunity for all. It says we should be on our own instead of bound together by common purpose.Read Post | Comments (57)Dean Obeidallah, 03/20/12Political Comedian and CommentatorOur media has not told us anything about the people allegedly killed by Robert Bales.
