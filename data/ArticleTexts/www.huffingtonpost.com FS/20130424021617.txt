{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Keith BoykinCNBC contributor, MSNBC commentator and former White House aideSunday\u0027s New York Times op-ed page featured an astonishing piece from Maureen Dowd arguing that gun background checks would have passed in the U.S. Senate if President Obama had been more aggressive. The column was widely criticized, but then Tuesday\u0027s Times promoted the same facile analysis in a news article about a president who \"hesitates to twist arms.\" What\u0027s troubling about this latest anti-Obama meme is that it promotes delusional and contradictory notions that President Obama would be more effective if he would (a) be meaner to his opponents, or (b) have dinner and drinks with them. Remember, this is a president who\u0027s arguably accomplished more progressive goals than any other Democratic president of the past century except FDR and LBJ. And while some pundits publicly pine for the days of master politicians like Bill Clinton, it\u0027s important not to succumb to historical revisionism about the past.Comments (70)Peter Alexander MeyersPolitical theorist and author of \u0027Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\u0027What if Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is more like Adam Lanza than Mohamed Atta? What if Boston is more like Newtown than 9/11? Will we be able to see that? And are you prepared to come to grips with what it actually means?Comments (398)Graham KittlePartner/Practice Leader, Business Analytics, IBMEvery company these days knows they have to get social. Yet often, even when organizations think they\u0027re embracing social media in a big way, they aren\u0027t. For most companies, social means marketing. It equals Facebook likes and Twitter followers. But that\u0027s just the price of entry into the social world we -- the 1.5 billion people using social networks -- are crafting around us.CommentsScott AtranAnthropologist; Author, \u0027Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists\u0027Because would-be jihadis best thrive and act in mostly small, self-organizing groups within networks of family and friends -- not in large movements or armies -- their threat can only match their ambitions if fueled way beyond actual strength by publicity.Comments (17)Kim BongiornoWriter, Blogger at \"Let Me Start By Saying\"Was it a place she wrote about what worries her? Is she describing her scary dreams at night? With a heavy, worried heart, I unlocked her diary to see what was inside. What did I find?Comments (1,118)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorA critical concern of our time is not simply our high levels of income inequality and their negative impact on opportunity and mobility. It\u0027s how inequality and immobility become entrenched in the system -- how they replicate.CommentsBrian StelterMedia reporter, The New York Times; Author, \u0027Top of the Morning\u0027The Today show\u0027s biggest problem could have simply been that Good Morning America (GMA) lusted more fiercely after victory. That GMA was hungrier.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThis Thursday, parents, children and caregivers around the country will participate in -- and celebrate -- yet another Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day, and it never stops being inspiring to me. For those of us who founded the annual tradition thirty years ago, the day starts out pretty normally, but by mid-morning excitement is in the air.Comments (44)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The so-called \"war on terror\" is a war without end. If we arrest American citizens and hold them indefinitely without trials, without lawyers, and without the protection of our system of justice, because we suspect they have ties with terrorists, where will that end?Comments (328)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Most of us accept that the earth goes around the sun. This is impressive since we can look up in the sky and see the sun going around the earth.Comments (806)Dana ClarkBlogger, \u0027Kale for Your Soul\u0027It is terror your friends and family do not get to touch or soothe because you pretend it\u0027s not there, and that is how you get dressed every day.Comments (35)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comThere was a secret history of twenty-first-century American war crying out to be written. Now, we have it in the form of Jeremy Scahill\u0027s latest book, Dirty Wars: The World Is a Battlefield.Comments (18)Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityWhatever school students choose, I hope they get at least these three things from their college experience: discovering work they love to do; getting better at it; learning to share that work with others.CommentsJohn Hutson and Donald J. GuterThe president should appoint a person of unquestioned stature and experience to work within the Administration and Congress to effectuate his long standing Executive Order to close Gitmo. No committees, no studies, no more analysis. Appoint someone to get it done.Comments (40)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostAs of now the Koch brothers are considered by some to be the frontrunners to purchase the Tribune papers. In this spirit, I thought it might be fun (and quite depressing) to explore how a Koch-run newspaper might have presented some of the most iconic news events in modern history.Comments (33)Ted Danson and Audrey Matura-ShepherdGiven the high frequency of oil spills in offshore drilling operations, the decision to green-light drilling operations in the Belizean Barrier Reef led to a fierce national debate. It appeared the government was likely to prevail. But things have now changed in Belize.Comments (20)Victor StengerPhysicist, Ph.D., bestselling author, author of \u0027God and the Atom\u0027News reports on the discovery of \"habitable\" planets are highly misleading. What scientists define as habitable just means that conditions may exist that are adequate for life based on carbon chemistry, such as the generic type of life we have on Earth.Comments (13)Les LeopoldAuthor, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)The new Rich List is out -- yet another example of financial pornography. While nearly 15 million Americans still can\u0027t find jobs due to the Wall Street-created crash, the top hedge manager, David Tepper, earned $1,057,692 an HOUR in 2012.Comments (295)Brittany GibbonsBlogger, \"Brittany, Herself\"My daughter is beautiful and smart and funny and graceful and witty and brilliant, and for four years, I nodded my head in agreement with every Joe off the street who told me she is exactly like me... when I thought exactly none of those things about myself.Comments (56)Craig KanalleySenior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostTwo-step authentication: I\u0027ll admit it can sometimes be annoying from the user perspective. But the peace of mind of the added security outweighs that. It\u0027s time for Twitter to implement it.Comments (11)David Cook-MartinInternational migration expertWe squander valuable human and cultural capital when in another time and place the unauthorized would have been citizens simply because they live and contribute to our common life, and have ties to American citizens. That\u0027s what\u0027s wrong with our system.CommentsDiana NyadLong-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcasterWe are building a custom pool and we\u0027re going to install it in Times Square. Starting May 28, I will swim in one lane for 48 continuous hours. In the lane next to me, we will invite all kinds of notable New Yorkers to do a few laps.CommentsMarcus SamuelssonAward-Winning Chef, Restaurateur \u0026 AuthorHow do I combat getting my weight out of control?

The fabulous homes, clothes, and opulent parties at first make the viewers admire the housewife and wish to be like her. But soon we see the \"real\" person, whose hubris reveals a deep unhappiness that they, being unreliable narrators, deny.Comments (138)Dan GlickmanVice President of the Aspen Institute and Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center42 is a movie about how personal courage can change the world. Courage comes in many forms. Last week we were reminded of the incredible courage of common citizens and first responders in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon attacks.CommentsJames FrancoActor and authorIn Concrete Comedy, David Robbins is interested in comedy that engages with the real world. One of his main examples of such an approach is Andy Kaufman. In effect, Robbins is our ambassador in the world of Andy; he allows us to see the artist behind the performance.CommentsMandy Fox-RaynorBlogger at TheFurFilesIf you\u0027ve been married for a long time, you can\u0027t expect your sex life to always be the way it is in the movie \u0027Nine ½ Weeks\u0027 -- a jello-filled-fun-fest -- because sometimes it\u0027s not.
