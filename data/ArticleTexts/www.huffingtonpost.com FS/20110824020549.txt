{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Last year, the three of us co-hosted the inaugural WIE Symposium (Women: Inspiration \u0026 Enterprise). It was a remarkable event, bringing together inspiring women leaders, activists, entertainers, and entrepreneurs from across the globe -- all gathering to share our ideas, our experiences, and our desire to help make life better for women around the world. This year\u0027s event -- taking place in New York September 18 and 19 -- promises to be even better, with an amazing lineup of speakers, honorees, and participants. Mika Brzezinski, Rosario Dawson, Iman, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Serena Williams are just a few of those scheduled to take part. We invite you to join us.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 8/23/11Editor, Eat the PressVice President Joe Biden has bought himself a controversy boomlet after briefly commenting on China\u0027s draconian one-child-per-family policy without strenuously condemning it, or single-handedly putting an end to it, or something.Read Post | CommentsPhil Mickelson, 08.22.2011Professional Golfer, The Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers AcademyWhat if we celebrated milestones in education with the same enthusiasm with which we celebrate achievement in sport?Read Post | Comments (1)Lee Siegel, 8/23/11Author, \u0027Are You Serious: How to Be True and Get Real in the Age of Silly\u0027It\u0027s one thing to joke about politics.

Indeed, it seduces you into thinking you can outsmart the film -- and then zaps you when you least expect it. Now that\u0027s fun.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 8/23/11Author, commentator and contributing editor, TheLoop21.comThere is an argument to be made that when candidates run solely for the sake of entertainment (their own entertainment or ours) they distract us from discussing the real issues that matter, with the candidates that will ultimately matter.Read Post | CommentsStephen Kaus, 8/23/11San Francisco AttorneyLiberals understand that Obama is not going to enact an economic policy by fiat; that something has to actually pass.

Dennis Kucinich, 8/23/11U.S. Representative from Ohio\u0027s 10th DistrictAs the Administration indulges itself with wars in Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States has massive economic problems at home. The American people get myths, rhetoric and unemployment, while war profiteers get the gold.Read Post | CommentsCharlotte Hilton Andersen, 8/23/11Author, \u0027The Great Fitness Experiment\u0027This past week I came across a large number of weight quotes attributed to various starlets that I feel need debunking -- both for their sake and for ours.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 8/23/11Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyWill a Super Committee plan that we will spend zero money in 2021 on occupying Afghanistan and Iraq be faulted as \"not supporting the troops\"?
