{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Throughout the first decade of the new century, before the recession hit, wages lagged behind living costs for the vast majority of Americans -- because the top one percent were capturing such a large share of the economy\u0027s total productivity gains. Some of this trend was the result of globalization undercutting the bargaining power of U.S. workers; some of it resulted from weakened trade unions and minimum wage laws lagging behind inflation. So when we finally climb out of this jobs recession, perhaps we can belatedly confront these deeper trends. How to do that? Unions, wage regulation, progressive taxation, and government using existing powers that it seldom exercises. But what about manufacturing? This brings me to the other Jobs of my title, the late Steve Jobs.Read Post | Comments (94)George Lakoff, 03/12/12Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics, Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!The Republican presidential campaign is not just about the presidential race.
