{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis was a week of expansion and contraction. Equal rights were allowed to continue expanding in Arizona, where Governor Jan Brewer vetoed an anti-gay bill masquerading as a \"religious freedom\" bill, and in Texas, where a federal judge ruled the state\u0027s gay marriage ban unconstitutional. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department announced that the deficit had shrunk to its smallest level since 2008 -- although the victory here is less clear, since the byproduct of deficit cutting in the middle of an ongoing recession has been prolonged unemployment and slow growth. The idea that government spending should contract at the same time the overall economy does is an American Hustle not worthy of an award. More entertaining will be seeing whether the cinematic American Hustle will triumph tonight -- or whether the Best Picture Oscar will go to fellow front-runners Gravity and 12 Years a Slave. My own prediction for a big win: Ellen.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027House Speaker John Boehner says raising the minimum wage is \"bad policy\" because it will cause job losses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says a minimum wage increase would be a job killer. This is all bunk.Comments (852)Adam WinklerProfessor of Law, UCLAAlthough easily lost in the political uproar over the proposed laws in Arizona, Kansas, Georgia and elsewhere, the truth is that most businesses don\u0027t need Beau Crow laws to give them legal cover for LGBT discrimination.Comments (15)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThroughout much of her long life Mrs. Clark was often at odds with South Carolina leaders and made other enemies as she traveled throughout the Deep South pioneering literacy and citizenship education for black Americans.CommentsArianna HuffingtonAhn-nyong-ha-seh-yo from Seoul. I\u0027m here for the launch of HuffPost Korea, which marks the 11th country where The Huffington Post\u0027s hybrid approach to journalism -- as a hub for original reporting and a blogging platform for a range of voices, both new and established -- is expanding the worldwide conversation.CommentsOliver LuckettFounder and CEO, theAudienceMy eyes hurt from doing nothing but staring at screen after screen all day -- from my laptop to my desktop screen to my iPhone and my iPad, TV screens, movie screens, I realized I was always staring at something other than the world.Comments (11)Noah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesAfter reading your stunningly bratty \"as told to\" New York Magazine tirade where you threatened to leave behind public life because you\u0027ve been so maligned by the queer community, there are a few things I want you to know.Comments (143)Claire McCarthy, M.D.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolIt\u0027s totally true that I could come home from work and get everything off the counter and table (again) and clean the bathrooms (again) and yell at the kids (again) to pick up all their stuff, but, well, I\u0027d rather not.Comments (194)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationThe education challenges in Nigeria are real and many. There is a teacher shortage of nearly 1.3 million, basic infrastructure is lacking and there is a shortfall of up to 1.2 million classrooms. There are fewer children in school each year due to child marriages and gender and religious biases and education is simply too costly for the poor.Comments (19)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersDiffering theological views on important issues of sexuality will need time, patience, deep biblical reflection, respectful discourse, and religious liberty to be worked out in the churches. But the perception of Christian faith is in grave danger when Christians try to use the law to publicly discriminate against those who don\u0027t adhere to their point of view.Comments (70)Beth LeybaCommunity activist, writer, student, momI am somebody. I have value. I am working, even if it\u0027s barely enough to get by. I will simply keep doing the best I can for my children, and I will continue feeding homeless youth even as I struggle to put food on my own table.Comments (164)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIgnoring the crazies is not unlike ignoring a suspicious mole. It might make you feel better to not worry about it, but it won\u0027t keep it from ballooning into something serious. And yes, I just compared Ted Nugent to skin cancer. With apologies to skin cancer.Comments (238)Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostWhen you read that story recently about the Burger King customers who were insulted on their order receipt, you may have felt shock, outrage and sympathy for the customers. I felt a little of that, but something else, too: I felt empathy for the employee who typed up the receipt and then got fired over it.Comments (295)Patton OswaltComedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesI emceed for Bill Hicks in 1991, at Charlie Goodnights in Raleigh, North Carolina. It changed what I wanted to do with comedy, almost instantly.Comments (32)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWith her slight build, distinctly precise diction, and relentless energy, Representative Shirley Chisholm of New York will be forever remembered for the ground she broke in Congress, and the ground she laid for millions of women, girls, and African Americans in this country.CommentsKia MakarechiSenior Editor for Mobile and Innovations, The Huffington PostThe debate over gentrification is in full-swing again after Spike Lee weighed in. His critics are calling him racist for ripping \u0027hipsters.\" They\u0027re wrong.Comments (147)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIf you look only at the categories for acting, women come in for an equal share of the Oscars, and are often held in higher esteem than the men. But peeking behind the velvet curtains, the scene shifts.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorShort of a mass popular resurgence, how can we break free of this destructive cycle of same-old bought and sold elections and tired rhetoric that ultimately leads to gridlock government?Comments (35)Rob JohnsonExecutive Director, Institute for New Economic ThinkingMany state and local governments are struggling to meet their obligations to retirees, and the easiest explanation is that workers are overpaid and their pensions are unaffordable. But the evidence suggests that the pensions crisis is both less pervasive and more complex than that.Comments (62)Karen J. GreenbergDirector, Center on National Security at Fordham Law SchoolIn his first weeks in office, in a series of executive orders and public statements, the new president broadcast for all to hear the five commandments by which life in his new world of national security would be lived. Five years later, the question is: How have he and his administration lived up to these self-proclaimed commandments?Comments (22)Dr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistBad dreams and nightmares are among the most startling and emotionally potent of remembered dreams. Even a partially remembered disturbing dream can linger in our waking minds. But what do we know about this phenomenon of disturbed dreaming? And what\u0027s the difference between a bad dream and a nightmare?CommentsSarah FaderParenting bloggerI am here to tell you that \"everyone\" was wrong. Two-year-olds are challenging, but they are nowhere near as hard to deal with as 3-year-olds.Comments (254)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostBills that encourage communities to rip apart the fabric of America should be seen for what they are: discriminatory and deeply un-American. That is my sincerely held religious belief.Comments (731)Natalie Singer-VelushSeattle mom of two and Managing Editor, ParentMap MagazineOnce you have children and a mortgage and a puppy that just had to come home with you for Christmas and jobs and a bottomless fridge that is never well-enough stocked no matter how many times you go to the grocery store, marriage changes.Comments (328)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"In this incredibly moving talk, waitress-turned-equal-rights-advocate Ash Beckham shares a story about how a little girl\u0027s innocence stopped her in her tracks. See what this profound encounter reveals about finding the courage to be yourself and to say the things you never thought you could say.Comments (155)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThere is an argument that the Internet makes us smarter, makes us faster, makes us more connected; it also appears to be making us meaner; especially in the warren of social media.CommentsJohn Kerry and William HagueWe see it especially in Goma, where one of us met in a hospital with young women so damaged by rape that they required surgery. And we see it in Syria today, where rape is being used as a tool of oppression. So is this personal to us? You bet.Comments (24)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIt\u0027s sometimes hard to believe that the year is 2014. For all of our advances, tech developments, innovations, achievements and progress, we are watching elected officials enact laws and propose others that are simply unbelievable.Comments (21)Raquel D\u0027ApiceStand-up comic and writer of \u0027The Ugly Volvo\u0027 humor/parenting blogI am, for now, a stay-at-home mother. People sometimes ask what exactly I do during the day and I never have any idea what to say.Comments (42)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistOkay, so it\u0027s official: being married makes a man healthier -- at least according to a new study, this one revealing that husbands have stronger bones than single guys.CommentsTed Danson and Andrew SharplessAlaska has already seen more than its fair share of oil disasters, and drilling in the Arctic will inevitably bring another spill. We ask you, do we really need another Exxon Valdez?CommentsQuora, 2014. 2.03Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, 2014. 2.03Susan Lieberman, Ph.D, 2014. 2.03Ernest Owens, 2014. 2.03Frank G.
