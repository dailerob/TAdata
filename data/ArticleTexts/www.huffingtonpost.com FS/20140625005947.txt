{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAmerican intervention has broken pottery all over the Middle East. Every time the U.S. attempts to repair its last accident, it increases and spreads the mess. It is time for a different approach. One in which Washington does not attempt to micromanage the affairs of other nations. In which Washington practices humility. This would not be isolationism. America, and especially Americans, should be engaged in the world. Economic and cultural ties benefit all. Political cooperation can help meet global problems. Humanitarian needs are varied and manifold. Military action sometimes is necessary, but only rarely -- certainly far less often than presumed by Washington.Judge Jeanine Pirro has set a new bar for fire-eating, not to mention the most easily-debunkable nonsense per sentence of any Fox News host, past or present.Managing Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowAccused of paying its workers too little, Walmart has responded in the most 2014 way possible: by being snarky on the Internet with a \"fact check.\" Unfortunately, it is longer on snark than on facts.Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostHere\u0027s the issue our nation is facing: The inability of the non-military side of our public institutions to process complex problems. Today, this competence and especially the capacity to solve technical challenges often exist only in the private sector.I\u0027m that homecoming queen who played DnDDo sleep on your left side. This is best for air-flow to the baby. Don\u0027t touch me. Can\u0027t you get into bed without touching me?Writer, ProducerThis month has brought ample evidence of the power of sleep to affect us in both positive and negative ways, and demonstrated why we need to start treating sleep as the vital health, safety and social issue that it is.From Egypt, it was off to Baghdad for John Kerry to see whether Iraq\u0027s bold effort in democratic nation building could be resuscitated in the face of imminent collapse. The problem there is that Kerry will have trouble locating a military strongman to back.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027The important thing is that a film doesn\u0027t obliterate a book. The movie is here now. But the book hasn\u0027t gone away. It has simply grown up, grown larger, and begun to glisten in a new way.Author, \u0027The Giver\u0027As President, my top priority is rebuilding an economy where everybody who works hard has the chance to get ahead. That\u0027s the subject of the first White House Summit on Working Families, which is taking place today.44th President of the United StatesPeople may assume that with a last name like \"Warrior,\" the baton of victory must have been handed to me. The truth is far from it.Chief Technology and Strategy Officer, CiscoI have decided to think back to my world view when I was my raw 25 year-old self. What would I have thought about my present life and what life advice would I have given \"back to the future\" to my 50 year-old self?Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhile this particular column of Will\u0027s was offensive and inaccurate, that doesn\u0027t mean the St. Louis Dispatch was right, or even wise, to discontinue running his column in general. Debate and discussion are what have helped bring much of the long and ongoing mistreatment of victims by school administrations to light.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhatever attributes Uganda\u0027s Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa may have, his election to the presidency of the 193-member UN General Assembly is overshadowed by his country\u0027s draconian legislation used to hunt down, isolate and jail homosexuals.Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsThe world has many problems to solve. Yet Silicon Valley, which could be taking the lead in ridding humanity of its ills, is focused on scoring big hits by solving problems so small they can be said to be non-existent.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurHillary Clinton is neither a liberal nor a true conservative. Rather, she\u0027s an electable Democratic candidate who leans to the right. She\u0027s the Democratic version of Mitt Romney. President Hillary Clinton will be a conservative Barack Obama and a somewhat liberal George Bush.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications.Counting myself in has been one of the greatest exercises of being a single mother, and it has not always been easy. Even when the numbers only go up to TWO, adding myself in -- and then clicking the camera button -- has reinforced with each photo that I am important, my face matters, I am still here.Writer at SassafrassThe insurgents are not only in a struggle against what they see as oppression by a largely Shiite government in Baghdad and its security forces, but also over who will control and benefit from what Maliki -- speaking for most of his constituents -- told the Wall Street Journal is Iraq\u0027s \"national patrimony.\"Eminent sociologist specializing in the study of insurgencyOver the years, I have witnessed the steady decline of the dolphins that used to chase our boat, the fish that I could land, and the plentiful shellfish I took for granted. The oceans of my childhood have been overfished, polluted, and strewn with plastic waste.Academy Award nominated actressBoth industry and environmental organizations declared victory on Monday and with some justification for each position. But if industry is being honest, on the core issue in UARG, they won 3 percent of what they asked for and lost the other 97 percent.Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterThe news media and bloggers have covered the memo\u0027s release extensively, particularly whether the Obama administration\u0027s position squares with the Constitution and U.S. laws. However, there are two areas that I believe are equally important that have been overlooked or ignored.Attorney in Washington, D.C.Just 25 years ago, scientists identified the previously unknown virus that has since killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. It now threatens the health of millions more.Director of CDC\u0027s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB PreventionSecretary Kerry failing to speak out clearly against violations of human rights in Egypt fails to advance American interests and only adds to our nation\u0027s soiled reputation as a defender of human rights.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstMost of reality doesn\u0027t matter, but a few things -- in this case choices -- matter a huge amount. In other words, there is a very small number of choices that will determine the great majority of results.Author, \u0027The 80/20 Principle\u0027Today only 20 percent of U.S. families have a working father and a stay-at-home mother. Instead, two thirds of families depend either partly or wholly on the wages of working women, and many of those families are barely making it. Fully 42 million women in this country and the 28 million kids who depend on them are teetering on or over the brink of poverty.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistFounder and CEO, Tipping Point CommunityMany today are calling for us to create a much more vocational style of teaching. They claim that in today\u0027s economy we should track students earlier into specific fields for which they seem to have aptitude. This is exactly the opposite of the American tradition of liberal education.President, Wesleyan UniversityWhether you\u0027re cheering for last year\u0027s reigning British champ or this year\u0027s French Open winner, what better time to don your tennis whites and host a viewing party for friends and family?CEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeIn the first months of 2014 alone, the trend of governments wresting away rights of LGBT people is nothing short of alarming.President, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsResilient people look for reasons to laugh. They find humor in the mundane. They understand that paying attention to the ordinary is what makes life extraordinary.Pediatrician, Writer, Photographer, Dog Lover and Student of Life.It\u0027s almost comical to think back to the first season of the Heat\u0027s Big Three and remember that there was a serious power struggle between LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. Fans everywhere were legitimately unsure of who was truly the better player and who should be the alpha dog.The Republican Party is in the throes of a power struggle, with the ballot box repeatedly settling things out, as it should. The Left has not, in recent years, suffered/benefited from a similar contest of ideas.Senior Fellow, DemosDoes the document, titled \"Long Term Strategic Vision and Vision Elements,\" really propose shuttering all field offices? The answer, buried beneath a barrage of obfuscatory consultantese, clearly seems to be \"yes.\"Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"BOEHNER THREATENS WAR WITH OBAMA",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
