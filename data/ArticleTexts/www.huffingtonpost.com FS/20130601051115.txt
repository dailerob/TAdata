{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mitchell BardWriter and FilmmakerIf you flipped on a news or entertainment program for the last two weeks, you have likely been inundated with news and jokes about the three \"scandals\" affecting the Obama administration. Of course, if the job of the press is to report on how elected officials\u0027 conduct impacts how we live our day-to-day lives, and on behavior that is consciously and directly bad for the vast majority of the country, there should be a tsunami of coverage of Republicans in power in Congress who are trying to subvert American democracy. Specifically, Republicans in the Senate are abusing the filibuster to keep jobs -- in both the executive and judicial branches -- unfilled while sitting idly by and letting economic growth take a hit in the name of ideology.Comments (451)David GalloOceanographerTo date we\u0027ve explored less than 5 percent of the world beneath the waves. So what\u0027s in the other 95 percent? Is it possible that by some chance we\u0027ve already found all of the exciting stuff, or is the ocean full of surprises?Comments (327)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAs the summer begins to really heat up, many of you may be thinking of heating up the barbecue too. After all, what\u0027s more fun than gathering friends and family for a sunny, backyard picnic or a garden party under the stars? But I\u0027ve always found that a little bit of planning can take a perfectly nice meal outside to the next level.Comments (40)Dr. Craig MalkinAuthor, Clinical Psychologist, Instructor Of Psychology for HMSThe most glaring problems are easy to spot -- but if you get too hung up on the obvious traits, you can easily miss the subtle (and often more common) features that allow a narcissist to sneak into your life and wreak havoc.Comments (258)Tim FerrissAuthor, \u0027The 4-Hour Workweek\u0027\"We\u0027ve all heard of acai, goji berries and chia seeds. But I\u0027d be willing to bet most of you are unfamiliar with more than a few of these more obscure superfoods.\"Comments (32)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundA law requiring Levi Reed\u0027s grandfather to store his gun safely might have saved Noah McGuire\u0027s life. Enough is enough. It is time for responsible citizens everywhere to stand up to the gun lobby and demand that politicians pass common sense gun safety and safe storage laws.Comments (25)Sandy GarossinoBusiness Owner, Community AdvocateFor years Facebook has maintained an imperious and stony silence against pleas from users and victims about its most objectionable content. But on May 27th, Facebook finally flinched.Comments (122)Olivia NuzziFreelance writer and studentAs in polling, you can get television numbers to tell you anything you want to hear. But even in that context, when ratings changes are as profound as MSNBC\u0027s, they tell a story that can be relied upon in terms of direction if not always in terms of exact degree.Comments (68)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Economic forecasters exist to make astrologers look good. But the recent jubilance is enough to make even weather forecasters blush. \"Just look at the bull market! Look at home prices! Look at consumer confidence!\"Comments (63)Richard SteinerProfessor and conservation biologistTo unleash the same destructive, uncontrolled corporate determinism into the deep sea that has destroyed much of the land surface of our planet would be an historic mistake.CommentsWilliam BaldwinActorThis shot over the bow of wrestling from the IOC could be the wakeup call we have been waiting for. Never before have I witnessed more outrage, more passion, and more interest for our beloved sport.Comments (89)Suzanne ToddFilm ProducerAs I celebrate my birthday this year, I want to encourage others to take on the idea of making birthday wishes. It doesn\u0027t cost money or take a lot of time, just a few focused minutes of looking within and then sharing your feelings.CommentsNathan GardelsEditor, NPQ, Global Services of Los Angeles Times Syndicate/Tribune MediaThe sovereign debt crisis and the high social costs of austerity have severely weakened the eurozone\u0027s foundation. Whether this tottering edifice finally collapses and falls, or is able to right itself, will depend on re-founding a European narrative for the 21st century.Comments (18)Jessica FessendenWriterI had developed an itching tick. Without having to think about it my right index finger would find its way to the back of my scalp and pick and pick and pick until it drew blood.CommentsJon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comFrom cheap styrofoam to ceramic to expensive bone China to plastic and even 20-dollar thermoses, everyone who drinks coffee has their favorite \"Caffeine Delivery Vehicle.\" And yet one question lingers: Which cup keeps the planet\u0027s favorite drink hotter... longest?CommentsDan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostMichele Bachmann in many ways is the perfect representation of the Tea Party: Loud, hateful and ultimately, inconsequential.Comments (275)David TrumbleAward-winning artist, cartoonist and illustratorWatching a collection of supposed experts trying to positively align the idealised (and increasingly narrow) vision of a conservative \"nuclear family\" and the natural world should be funny, but instead it\u0027s just deeply worrying.Comments (62)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027On Memorial Day weekend, our family of four participated in six baseball games!

She shared how sugar can make our minds us edgier and less clear, and revealed the ways to overcome cravings on the road to resetting our bodies from sugar dependency.Comments (80)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportLeBron James, in Game 5 Thursday night, showed Frank Vogel and the Pacers why people like to say players, not coaches, win championships.CommentsMario LivioAstrophysicist, Space Telescope Science InstituteThe deep ocean is not the only place where we can marvel at the wonders of nature. The heavens are another such place, and the Hubble Space Telescope, in particular, has captured for us some images about which we can truly say that they are \"out of this world.\"CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThere\u0027s no doubt that Beck is a conspiracy theorist. He\u0027s a purveyor of wacky, purely fabricated gibberish leading to the ultimate conclusion that there\u0027s an unholy alliance composed of the Obama government and \"fascist\" progressives out to destroy us all.Comments (279)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIt\u0027s a sad state when such outright corporate hypocrisy becomes standard fare. Perhaps CEOs, such as Tim Cook, have become too accustomed to corporations having enormously greater privileges and immunities than actual persons.Comments (52)Lisa FirestonePsychology expert on relationships, parenting, self-destructive thoughts and suicide; author, \u0027Conquer Your Critical Voice\u0027Mindfulness presents a valuable tool for facing the daily challenges of staying close to our partner. It allows us to become more centered and calm, so we can talk things out instead of spiraling into a screaming match.CommentsHelene GaylePresident and CEO of CARE USAPrograms focused on the empowerment of girls and women are a solution to poverty. But empowering a woman with the skill to make a blanket or feed her family is not enough.CommentsBill McKibbenAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027You need to see this: Former Obama administration green jobs advisor Van Jones just came out swinging against Keystone XL. Van doesn\u0027t just raise the stakes, he debunks the outright myths that are leading our nation down a road to disaster.Comments (187)Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostIf workers now earning $8 an hour inside warehouses or at fast-food counters manage to get more pay, they are not going to hide the extra money in the Cayman Islands or leave it to their heirs via elaborate trusts. They will go out and spend it almost immediately, boosting their local economies.Comments (1,456)Ester BloomWriter; Full of Pith and VinegarLike a drunk person crashing at your house, a baby may need to be carried inside; paw at your breasts, with or without other people present; and insist on telling long, incomprehensible stories.Comments (31)Christine Gross-LohAuthor, Parenting Without Borders: Surprising Lessons Parents Around the World Can Teach UsEvery society values its own skill sets for its own reasons. The problem in America is that, while we excel at raising spectacularly verbal kids, we have lost sight of other values that we need to foster in our children.Comments (69)Jonathan KimFilm Critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising ShowWhile The Prestige explores the craft and mindset of differing magicians, Now You See Me uses magic to justify a story that, on cursory examination, proves to be little more than smoke and mirrors.CommentsAndy MankoFather of two living in the GTAIn less than two years I went from a guy who would take an elevator up one flight of stairs to someone who fulfilled a lifelong dream and climbed Kilimanjaro.
