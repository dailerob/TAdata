{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"It\u0027s a curious thing about Afghanistan: every time a politician makes the case for why we need to stay, he or she ends up making the case for why we should leave. \"You have the most corrupt government that we have ever dealt with from a conflict standpoint,\" said Sen. Saxby Chambliss. \"And until you provide some stability and some confidence in the Afghan people about the way forward from a governing standpoint, then I think that we could win militarily and still have a very ugly victory.\" And he thinks he\u0027s making a case for staying! It\u0027s truly bizarre how many in Washington are describing the situation in Afghanistan accurately, but then fail to draw the most obvious conclusion based on what they\u0027ve just said.Read Post | CommentsNaomi Klein, 06.28.2010Award-winning journalist and author of The Shock DoctrineMy city feels like a crime scene, and the criminals are fleeing the scene.
