{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027The nuclear deal as negotiated is a far cry from the kind of irresponsible capitulation critics of the negotiations charge. The high-profile criticism coming from Israel and Congressional Republicans channel the most extreme examples of the last weapons of mass destruction witch-hunt -- involving Iraq -- which culminated in a war that killed thousands, cost trillions, and destabilized and further radicalized a region of the world essential to international prosperity. History does matter, both in terms of how we got to where we are, and in predicting where we are going. When it comes to Iran and its nuclear program, the world would do well to take a different path than that chosen for Iraq, and let inspections, not bombs, do the work of disarmament.While I think it\u0027s very unlikely that the 126,000 payroll gain marks a new, much slower trend in job growth, there are reasons for caution, especially at the Federal Reserve. This job market has fooled us before, with more head fakes then an NCAA point guard.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPart of sisterhood means acknowledging that all of our sisters walk different paths and face unique challenges. One of the challenges we (white women) do not face -- no matter how you cut it: size, shape, ability or education level -- is representation.Author, blogger, and poet.This deal will verifiably prevent Iran from building a bomb for at least 15 years. No American troops will be killed, and it won\u0027t cost us a dime.

Today I am wearing a short-sleeved grey dress with striping on the edges. I also wore it on Monday. That\u0027s OK, right?Managing Editor, HuffPost BusinessIt is encouraging that CEOs have taken an active role in the Indiana debate. But they can\u0027t do it alone. Leaders from all walks of life, from government officials to civic leaders, need to embrace diversity in all forms. Speaking publicly against discrimination is the first step in that process.Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolClearly, the struggle to create a nation and world of economic and social justice and environmental sanity is not an easy one. But this I know: Despair is not an option if we care about our kids and grandchildren. Giving up is not an option if we want to prevent irreparable harm to our planet. We must stand up and fight back.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontMany children eagerly look forward to the end of the school year and the carefree days of summer, playing outside in the warm sun, splashing and swimming in pools and at beaches, and gathering with family and friends for backyard barbeques. But for more than 17 million children the end of school can be the end of certainty about where and when their next meal will come.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundRakesh Bhattacharjee is an assistant professor of pediatrics at The University of Chicago\u0027s Divisions of Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine.

A bully calling his victim a bully is hard to digest.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyIn his landmark 2000 report, \"Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General,\" Surgeon General David Satcher wrote that \"there are profound and consequential disparities in the oral health of our citizens.\" Those disparities persist, and not only that, but lack of access to affordable dental care has spread to the middle class.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThough it\u0027s traditional for the youngest child to ask 4 questions, the main question most people ask is \"When do we eat?\" That\u0027s because many of the attendees find the seder spiritually deadening and politically obtuse. But introduce my material, and no one will say that that seder was boring.Editor, Tikkun MagazineThe Presidential Task Force on Combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing and Seafood Fraud needs to put the words of the final plan into action. Oceana will continue to push for transparency in the supply chain, including traceability for all seafood sold in the United States.Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaWrite a letter today to someone you love that can be kept, savored, and passed along to family members when the time is right. Send a handwritten invitation by mail instead of an evite. Remember, when you sign a letter in your own hand, you are attesting that you and you alone are responsible for its content. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s possible with an email.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” published by HCI, December 2014Today\u0027s lackluster employment report shows that despite substantial job market improvements over the last year or so, the Federal Reserve should not yet start raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and producing unacceptable inflation. There\u0027s still too much labor market \"slack\" for the Fed to shift its chief concern to the risk of too much inflation.Chief Economist, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWhile many members of Congress remain wary of the costs of reducing climate change pollution, they need look no further than the largest state economy in our nation for a perfect example of how to take action.U.S. Representative, California\u0027s 47th Congressional DistrictThis Sunday, I will go to church, have a big family dinner and break my Lenten fast. Next Sunday, I will go to church, have a big family dinner and break my Lenten fast all over again.College and Education Fellow, The Huffington PostA spokesperson for the U.S. DOJ recently told the L.A. Times that a bipartisan amendment passed by Congress last year prohibiting DOJ from spending any money to undermine state medical marijuana laws doesn\u0027t prevent it from prosecuting people for medical marijuana or seizing their property.Drug Policy Alliance, Director of National AffairsWhat the Latin American show demonstrates unequivocally is the necessity of political and social ideas to meld with architecture to produce innovation.This emphasis on the indigenous and away from roving starchitects is certainly appealing and hints that the way forward should be inclusive of one\u0027s own country\u0027s rich architectural heritage.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnReligious liberty is critically important and, yes, threatened. But the Indiana law was different from the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. And the strong public reaction against it also comes from people who believe in the protection of religious liberty, but not in ways that use it to condone discrimination in the public sphere against anyone.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe healthcare industry is a longstanding anchor in many urban centers.

Our thoughts and prayers are with them.President, Wesleyan UniversityWorking is critical: Many owe significant fines, court fees, and 85% of female ex-offenders have children to support. But for ex-offenders, getting a job through normal channels is next to impossible -- many lack hard skills and work experience, with nothing on their resume except their conviction.Social entrepreneur, film producer, and Founder of fair trade jewelry company, Same SkyGraham is not wrong that parents should teach their children to respect law enforcement. But his post failed to acknowledge that the relationship between institutions of authority and citizens is a two-way street.Preacher and Civil Rights ActivistWatching Kimmy Schmidt navigate her new world, I recognize that after breaking out of my bunker-like closet, I did not simply come out gay.

You don\u0027t have to believe it. You just have to tell it.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorInequality is a problem for everyone -- for business, for the health of the democracy and for society at large.
