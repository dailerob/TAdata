{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author of \"Who\u0027s Afraid of Post-Blackness? What It Means To Be Black Now\"We should just call it what it is: Donald Trump is the leader of the White Lives Matter movement. Someone had to start it -- they were gettin\u0027 out of control. First, one of them became president and now they\u0027re in the streets protesting every time a Black thug gets shot. They\u0027re gettin\u0027 a little too free. Then Trump arrived like white supremacy\u0027s version of Santa Claus with a bag full of gifts. He gave them swagger. He gave them unadulterated machismo. We should have seen Trump coming. We should have known that decades of Republican race baiting and decades of the GOP welcoming racists in their tent would eventually lead to \"Make America White Again.\" We should have known that the browning of America and the growing inclusivity of America was not going to be taken lying down. To some, sadly, any advance by Black and brown people is a loss for whites.Communities across the country have been dealing with lead issues for years -- but they\u0027ve always fallen on a deaf ear. Flint is simply the perfect storm. There\u0027s this false sense of security that we\u0027ve all been lulled into, and only now are people actually waking up to reality.Consumer Advocate and Environmental ActivistAn elephant by the name of Nosey has become quite a symbol of so much that has gone awry with our society and our governing agencies. This is just one single case of pure injustice that has gotten lost in the system.Academy Award-winning actress and animal rights advocate/activistWhy are we wasting time apportioning blame before the problem is fixed and the poor children and families of Flint have fresh, clean water to drink and cook with and bathe in?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundSnuggling on the sofa with my eight-year daughter one evening, a commercial for the nightly news hinted of a sensational story about the 2016 political candidates. My daughter looked at me, with sadness in her eyes, \"Mommy, I don\u0027t want Trump to be president.\" \"Why is that, baby?\" I ask. \"Because half of my friends would disappear from school!\"Writer. Blogger. Babysitter by day. Social Media Managing Editor for Mommy Drinks Wine and Swears™ by night.All Democrats should worry because her major policy and character flaws could leave us with a Republican president this fall.

This week, European leaders are gathering to discuss the particulars.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogI was a successful model who experienced all of the dark issues you can imagine. I\u0027m speaking out in the hopes that others will come forward, use their voices and get the help they need. These are \"silent\" issues that shouldn\u0027t remain so.Former Model, Commercial Actress \u0026 Host turned Author, Speaker \u0026 Mental Health AdvocateThe first reason Putin intervened in Syria was simply to show that he could. He had two audiences for this: the Russian public and the West, particularly the United States.Geopolitical Forecaster and StrategistIn advance of President Barack Obama\u0027s historic visit to Cuba on March 22, there is speculation about whether he can pressure Cuba to improve its human rights. But a comparison of Cuba\u0027s human rights record with that of the United States shows that the U.S. should be taking lessons from Cuba.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawCarlos Santana tells me that finishing his latest album was like \"the end of New Year\u0027s Eve and the Fourth of July, right before the end of the fireworks, when you know they\u0027re going to let them all out.\"Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetIn the long run, torture will continue playing a destructive role in Syria, even after the conflict ends, unless Syrian society uniformly condemns it and works to reform current and future practices.Executive Director of the Syria Justice \u0026 Accountability CenterIn the small town of Vinh Chau there are about 700 people blind in one eye and 300 more blind in both eyes. Vinh Chau is one of the most fertile red onion production centers of Vietnam, and it is a major reason for their vision loss.Traveloguer and Asia EnthusiastEvery day, Americans use mental illness as shorthand for bigotry, for stupidity, for violence. For sure, violence can be a part of some mental illness. But for those of us inside mental institutions hoping to get out, we are not given the luxury of being angry like Trump or bigoted like Cruz.Journalism student, Northeastern UniversityWe need a less ideological, more serious assessment of the specifics of defense spending. We should not view the Department of Defense budget as sacrosanct. There are many areas where cuts should be seriously considered.Distinguished Scholar, Indiana UniversityBEIRUT -- Putin\u0027s surprise drawdown announcement seems intended to test whether it\u0027s possible for America and Russia to trust one another and work together in Syria, and to find a path to an eventual solution for the war-torn country. A lot rides on this; it\u0027s not just about Syria. It will shape the global order, one way or another.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027Kevin Bobal slid a tiny, nondescript plastic cup toward me. It has a sweetness, he told me, referring to the clear liquid inside.Father of twins, journalist, writer, lover of bourbon, wine and great beerYet again Washington is only doing what it has done before. Unfortunately, the same policy will yield the same result as before. It is time to try something different.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe Reuters report put this colossal dereliction simply: \"A law in effect since 1992 requires annual audits of all federal agencies--and the Pentagon alone has never complied.\"Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI believe the great political and historical reality behind all the rhetoric and conflict we now see and feel in our country is this: In just a few decades, America will no longer be a white majority nation; we will instead be a majority of minorities.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersAs someone who cares passionately about the state of my industry, I think the fact that Cesar\u0027s methods are being called into question is an important wake up call for the public. We need to make some major changes to the dog training industry as a whole.Zak George, dog trainer, YouTube star, and author of Zak George’s Dog Training RevolutionAward-winning journalist, co-author of Zak George\u0027s Dog Training Revolution and author of Previvors: Facing the Breast Cancer Gene and Making Life-Changing DecisionsPrecisely three years ago, I was fired from my job. I\u0027m brought into a conference room with the shades drawn and told that the company no longer needs my services? -- ?that my position is being eliminated, and my tenure expires today. I cry. It\u0027s over.Staff Writer, The Daily DotIf you\u0027re looking for the shared beginning of all our stories, it was one morning in July 2013.

Apple uses many arguments in defense of its position. Prominent among them states that if Apple granted to the U.S. government a way to encrypt the phones of terrorists, this move will set a precedent, and Apple will be forced to do the same for other governments.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe decision to terminate a pregnancy can be complex, it can be simple, or it can just be what is best for the person in that moment. As a doctor and abortion provider, it is my duty to convey why the right to access safe and legal abortion matters.Family physician and abortion advocateJacob Bernstein\u0027s HBO documentary about his mother, Nora Ephron, proves the inside-the-box life is not worth living, as it gives you little material to work with. Probably the most famous line from an Ephron movie is \"I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having.\" It also sums up how many of us feel about Ephron.
