{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027While the Administration and the Republicans and far too much of the commentariat are obsessed with public debt, private debts are killing the recovery. Some 22 percent of mortgages are still under water, and student debt has surpassed a trillion dollars. Banks can unload their toxic securities onto the Fed. Corporations can use the bankruptcy code\u0027s Chapter 11 to write off old debts (including to their pensioners) and get a \"fresh start.\" But college borrowers stay indentured forever, as do underwater homeowners unless they want to lose the house.The upside-down policy, of cutting public spending, giving debt relief to banks and corporations, while showing no mercy to students and homeowners, keeps the whole economy in debtors\u0027 prison. Until these policies change, we can look forward to a decade of high unemployment and an underperforming economy.Comments (329)Jeff WeinerCEO, LinkedInAs I opened my car door and started thinking about getting home to my wife and our two girls, it hit me: For as hard as I worked to manage compassionately at the office, I was not always actively applying the same approach with my family.Comments (19)Arianna HuffingtonBecoming Fearless is part of our larger effort to put the spotlight on what is working in our culture rather than just on what\u0027s dysfunctional. Taken individually, these stories inspire. Taken together, they testify to something larger -- that in the face of multiple crises, people are responding with strength, courage and resilience.Comments (37)David BromwichProfessor of Literature at YaleIs America at War with Islam? The question began to be asked when the first evidence emerged of the transfer of hundreds of innocent Muslims to Guantanamo and the despotic new order that permitted indefinite detention of suspects.Comments (570)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.By the time we reach the 2014 election, almost one third of the current Senate will have resigned in the past three elections. Recent reports indicate that those formerly considered to be virtually automatic candidates are rejecting the opportunity to seek the vacated seats.Comments (339)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Repealing laws by hollowing them out -- failing to fund their enforcement or implementation -- works because the public doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s happening. Enactment of a law attracts attention; de-funding it doesn\u0027t.Comments (342)Randi ZuckerbergFounder and CEO, Zuckerberg Media; Editor-In-Chief, Dot ComplicatedAs parents, we need to ask ourselves whether we\u0027re posting photos for our children or for ourselves. And if you\u0027re posting it for yourself, wait a little bit before pressing the \"share\" button so you can really think about if it\u0027s in your child\u0027s best interest.Comments (181)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupOf all the things, Theon\u0027s tormentor says, the only thing I genuinely believe is this: \"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven\u0027t been paying attention.\" Honestly, I think the same could be said for this whole series.Comments (238)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostRecently the Tony Blair Foundation ran an essay contest in which the young people were asked to write about their \"Friend of a different faith or belief,\" what resulted were extraordinary essays from around the world.Comments (64)Jillian SandersBook PublicistThe night of my 30th birthday, I fell asleep in my mother\u0027s childhood bedroom. The next morning, my grandparents served me Entenmann\u0027s crumb cake. It was the first birthday I celebrated without a date in 10 years. I felt whole and at peace.Comments (33)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThe GOP forced flexibility act is part of a list of proposals House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) calls \"Making Life Work.\" That\u0027s right, Republicans intend to make life nothing but work. No eight hours for sleep. No eight hours for anything you will. Just work, Gumby, just work.Comments (341)Kim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comThe mothers who have walked this road before me tell me that new babies find more curves of your body to snuggle into, everyone fitting perfectly, nestled together like a set of measuring spoons that were always meant to accompany each other. I suppose that it must be true. But what if it isn\u0027t?Comments (57)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorProposed tax changes should have to stand on whether they\u0027ll a) help to raise the revenue we need to meet future challenges that are coming fast, or b) boost growth in ways that actually matter to contemporary economies.Comments (91)Melinda HillComedian, writer and actress responsible for creating the series Romantic EncountersMy longest relationship has been with commitment phobia. But I seriously do think I could get married if I could do it with a month-to-month lease.CommentsKen Dychtwald Ph.D.Gerontologist, psychologist, author, entrepreneur and public speakerToday, life in adulthood and beyond is far more like rafting down a twisting, turning whitewater river. Its length is uncertain -- you might live 70, 90 or 110 years -- and new challenges, opportunities, discoveries, and potential surprises are around each bend.Comments (32)Rep. Karen BassU.S. Representative for California\u0027s 33rd Congressional DistrictLast month marked the one year anniversary of student loan debt crossing the $1 trillion mark -- making it second only to mortgage debt. Americans now owe more in student loan debt then credit card or automobile debt with the past 10 years showing a staggering 511 percent increase.Comments (23)HuffPost RadioWhile both sides can lapse into \"content bias,\" should the following facts alter pre-conceived views: the Boston bombers were young Muslim men; some sarin gas was detected in Syria; the Reinhart-Rogoff study is flawed? Erick Erickson and Ron Reagan debate.CommentsMrs Ban Soon-taekUnited Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), Women for PeaceI travel as the wife of the United Nations Secretary-General, but I view their struggles and triumphs through the lens of my experiences as a mother and grandmother.CommentsEva HausmanCo-founder, Mother\u0027s Day MovementOn Mothers\u0027 Day 2011, we mothers gave birth to the Mothers\u0027 Day Movement. By moving the apostrophe, we have pledged to make Mother\u0027s Day more meaningful by asking family, friends, and donors to rethink their giving priorities.CommentsDon TapscottAdvisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027Blackberry? Are you kidding me? I converted to the iPhone ages ago. Except that I\u0027ve been trying out Blackberry\u0027s newest phone, the Q10, for a week. And guess what? I love it. Like a phoenix from the ashes, Blackberry may actually be making a comeback.CommentsSteven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolOnly hypocrisy and demagoguery can explain Republican opposition to gun regulation, alleging potential infringement of constitutional freedoms alongside Republican support for monitoring American citizens based solely on religion and empowering the government to deprive citizens of their rights, by deeming them enemy combatants.Comments (87)C. M. RubinBlogger and author, \u0027The Real Alice in Wonderland\u0027During the course of my son\u0027s elementary and secondary school education, he has been able to forge warm and in some cases life-changing relationships with remarkable teachers.CommentsRabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterI believe that misguided messages like what one hears at most university commencements are what have led to the profound contradiction in American life whereby we are the richest society in the entire world but also the most depressed.CommentsKathryn MeadNursing studentThis nine-month-old child was precisely the size of her newborn brother. This infant\u0027s small head peaking out of the blanket showed signs of despair; sunken, glassy eyes shot right to my heart.CommentsMike Weisser\u0027The Gun Guy\u0027 at EvolveSorry I couldn\u0027t make it to the annual meeting. I\u0027m a Life Member and I try to get there every year. But this year is different. If I showed up you\u0027d tried to get me to help you fight a \"culture war.\" But if there is a war going on, you represent the wrong side.Comments (624)Carly FiorinaGlobal Ambassador for Opportunity InternationalIn developing countries, women are disproportionately affected by the challenges of extreme poverty yet time and time again find the courage to provide a brighter future for their children.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAny systematic attempt to parse the meanings of the term \"terrorism\" is likely to be frustrated, however earnest the effort. It is a laudable aim to clarify policy choices as a prelude to making more informed decisions more candidly explained to the public. But that is politically unrealistic in today\u0027s climate.CommentsEcumenical Patriarch BartholomewSpiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwideThe Resurrection challenges us to reflect on where we most deeply experience hostility and disunity. Images of this reality abound: Within the space of only a few weeks, in America alone, we have painfully witnessed the loss of children to gun violence, the loss of life to religious radicalism and the loss of residents to a plant explosion.Comments (222)Noel A. PoyoExecutive Director for the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders (NALCAB)Too much emphasis has been put on immigration reform as a social policy that will benefit immigrants, and not enough has been done to highlight the positive economic impact that immigration reform will have on entire cities and regions.Comments (27)Angela MaiersEducator, Author, SpeakerMy engagement usually has an official sounding title. I conduct \"walk-throughs\" and \"technology audits,\" and advise on \"best practices for technology integration.\" So what is the first piece of advice I offer to every group of educators I advise?Comments (25)Dave JohnsonFellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FuturePresident Obama set a goal of 1 million new manufacturing jobs in his second term. Last month we added zero. Not one. Nada. Zip. We did add low-wage jobs, though. Maybe we can talk about a national manufacturing strategy now?Comments (271)Linda Joy Myers, Ph. D.Author, writing coach, therapistFor years, as Mother\u0027s Day approached, my stomach would have its usual knot of anxiety, my brain running overtime, telling me to send a card even though I had never lived with my mother, even though she pretended she didn\u0027t have a daughter or grandchildren.Comments (45)David Shing, 2013. 6.05Jon Summers, 2013. 6.05Jon Steely, 2013. 6.05Ariel Chesler, 2013. 6.05Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013. 6.052morrowknight, 2013. 6.05Nicholas Warner, 2013. 6.05Maureen Elinzano, 2013. 6.05Jeff Thelen, 2013. 6.05Daniel Browne, 2013. 6.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"AIR FORCE SEXUAL ASSAULT CZAR ARRESTED FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
