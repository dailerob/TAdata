{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressAny time a thing happens in politics, the media has \"Takeaways\" about that thing. And whenever the media has a bunch of Takeaways, Eat The Press gathers all of those Takeaways in one place, so that you can sate your yawning hunger for Takeaways. This past weekend, the Beltway played host to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, which, by Eat the Press\u0027 count, resulted in 62 hot, delicious Takeaways. Here is a definitive ranking of all of them.To allow an Israeli politician to use the venue of the United States Congress as a platform for political grandstanding in support of his re-election bid is equally demeaning to Americans and Israelis alike.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027After many years of neglecting sleep\u0027s importance in our lives, we\u0027ve entered a golden age of sleep studies. Christian Benedict, a neuroscientist at Uppsala University in Sweden, is helping lead this scientific movement, with a particular emphasis on how sleep is connected to performance in school.A failure to take on the moneyed interests sacrifices the potential enthusiasm of millions of voters -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- who know the game is rigged, and who yearn for a leader with the strength and courage to un-rig it, and thereby give them and their children a fair chance.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027May you always be so proud of your body -- pointing out your beautiful belly and happy to see your reflection in the mirror. You only get one body, so continue to love it.Mom, blogger, health coach and fitness instructorNetanyahu\u0027s speech may be evidence of hubris run amok on his part, but it is also a vivid illustration of the pervasive and destructive rise of partisanship in American politics over the last few decades.Managing Editor of Global Politics, Carnegie Scholar, Associate Fellow at The Centre for Global ConstitutionalismNetanyahu\u0027s ongoing Congressional speech fiasco is only the most recent example, whereby he has weakened Israeli security on multiple fronts. In choosing to publicly challenge President Obama on his home turf, the Prime Minister has further eroded their personal relationship -- a feat that seemed nearly impossible.Outreach and Research Consultant at Americans for Peace NowThe Israeli election falls exactly two weeks after Netanyahu\u0027s visit to Washington. How then can we avoid interpreting his speech to Congress as an attempt to merge the interests of the Republican Party and Benjamin Netanyahu?Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityNetanyahu\u0027s speech to Congress was brilliantly deceitful because it played to the fantasies that Israeli propaganda and right wing militarists in the US have been popularizing for the past thirty years.Editor, Tikkun MagazineThe Islamic State is evil. But that\u0027s no reason for America to go to war again in the Middle East. Or for Congress to approve years more of conflict.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIt worries me that boys are told that showing emotion is a weakness. And don\u0027t get me started on their notion of invincibility and willingness to jump off sheer cliff faces just for the hell of it. So, with all of this in mind, I\u0027ve done a lot of thinking about how I can raise my boys to be good men.Writer, mum, wife, feminist, northern expat, PND survivor. In no particular order.After consulting with my colleagues, my staff, my family, and my conscience, I will regretfully not be attending the address by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the House Chamber on Tuesday.Congressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoViolence against women and girls is an epidemic of global proportions. Transcending geographic borders, economic and social class, religion and ethnicity, violence impacts women of all ages, in all communities around the world.Vice Chair, Clinton FoundationI\u0027m sympathetic to the notion that since we already have lower tariffs than our trading partners, there are gains to be made on this front. But if the negotiators are truly saying we simply cannot have a trade deal that blocks currency managers, then maybe we shouldn\u0027t have a trade deal.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe first step towards a new evolution in our interactions with North Korea is to appreciate the perspectives that each of the nations engaged in the Six Party Talks has on the challenges which North Korea presents, and the varying ways that each reacts to them.Chairman and CEO of the JoongAng Media NetworkShe is both crushingly disabled by autism and absolutely, emphatically her own self. She is a gift, that much is true. But her autism, like my missing fingers or my damaged DNA, is not.There\u0027s no wrong way to be a woman.I now declare that I am going vegan about twice a month, usually after being disturbed by the mistreatment of yet another animal in the mainstream dairy industry. And then I\u0027m at a restaurant and spy a cheese plate on the menu and it even includes Gruyere. Oh Gruyere, you are my weakness.Executive editor, The DodoThe DOJ has the authority to issue deportation orders. In a recent decision, the DOJ admitted that it has been misinterpreting certain citizenship statutes since 2008. As a consequence, DOJ officers have been incorrectly ordering U.S. citizens deported. What will the government do about U.S. citizens who already were mistakenly deported?Director, Federal Immigration Appeals ProjectIt\u0027s not that I don\u0027t want children right now. It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t want children until after I\u0027m married, or after I\u0027ve paid off my student loan debt, or after I\u0027ve bought a house. There is no caveat to this statement. I do not want children ever.Research Assistant, Washington, DCThis may be one of the most transparent public killings of our time, and yet evidence is hard to come by. Nemtsov was shot four times in the back. Even when there is a smoking gun, there is no smoking gun. In the absence of facts, the speculation about possible culprits says far less about reality than it does about the speculators\u0027 worldviews.Professor of Russian \u0026 Slavic Studies, New York UniversitySome don\u0027t believe they are worthy of love, so they bully others into being with them, or they give themselves away so people won\u0027t leave them. They hope another person will heal them.Zen Parenting Radio Host, Author, Self-Awareness TeacherA fight is coming because past trade deals have cost jobs and wages, devastated entire regions, and accelerated corporate power and income/wealth inequality -- which it is becoming clear was the intent.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe major oil company Royal Dutch Shell wants to drill in the Chukchi Sea this summer and that could, in the long term, spell doom for one of the last great, relatively untouched oceanic environments on the planet.Founder, ClimateStoryTellers.orgPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideWe are offended by the situation in which we find ourselves, in which education policy is dictated by billionaires who never taught a day in their lives, while our patiently gained professional expertise is ignored. Thirty days of testing is sufficiently outrageous and -- we believe -- indefensible.History teacher, Science Park High SchoolEnglish teacher, Science Park High SchoolUpon the electronic distribution of a picture of nothing more than a dress, we saw the birth of the stalwart White-and-golders and the die-hard Black-and-bluers. This dress is a nice example of how what you see isn\u0027t necessarily what you perceive.Scientist, Allen Institute for Brain SciencePeople who live extraordinary personal and professional lives do not live in the space of mediocrity. There are phrases that they will never even think to speak. Here are 12 of them we\u0027ve all heard before... some of us may have even spoken them. See if anything sounds familiar.Soul-centered scribe, Prof \u0026 Doc side gigRepublican Congress or not, big-money opposition or not, progressives can win victories over the next couple of years if they stay creative, stay aggressive, and never give up. The last couple of weeks have given proof enough of that reality.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersWe loved our students. They worked hard; they were motivated; they found such joy in learning. But the odds were stacked against them.Director, Peace CorpsProven, science-based protocols worked for me, and it has worked for hundreds of my colleagues who have returned from this and past Ebola outbreaks without infecting anyone.Associate Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, Attending Physician in Emergency Medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New YorkTo get back to that level and maybe even surpass it, we need someone in charge at the Federal Reserve who understands that creating conditions that increase the purchasing power of American workers\u0027 paychecks is a part of her mandate. From what she\u0027s said and done so far, it appears Janet Yellen is exactly that kind of Fed chair.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"BUPKIS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
