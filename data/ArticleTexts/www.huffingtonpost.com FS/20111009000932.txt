Bernie Sanders, 10/7/11Independent U.S. Senator from VermontIf this country is to break out of the horrendous recession and create the millions of jobs we desperately need, there is no question that the American people are going to have to take a very hard look at Wall Street and demand fundamental reforms.Read Post | Comments (22)Dylan Ratigan, 10/7/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027How, exactly, is this working?

Stay in the race, and keep fighting.Read Post | Comments (123)Matthew Dowd, 10/8/11Political StrategistHe has no organization, no real money, no real plan, but he is rising in the polls, and I believe mainly this is tied to his brand of leadership, and that he actually is the one who comes closest to Ronald Reagan\u0027s style of communicating, or even Bill Clinton\u0027s, actually.Read Post | Comments (29)James Peron, 10/8/11President, Moorfield Storey InstituteMaddow can afford to worry about whether \"gay culture\" will lose something if gay people can marry. Lots of gay couples can\u0027t.

Pete Stark, 10/7/11Democratic Congressman from CaliforniaWe don\u0027t want to commemorate an 11th anniversary in Afghanistan.

Borosage, 10/7/11President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureNo one is confused about the message. Wall Street got bailed out; Main Street was abandoned.
