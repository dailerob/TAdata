{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaDuring our taping of Left, Right, and Center Friday morning, Tony Blankley, the insiders’ insider for conservative Washington, said this of Bill Frist: \"There is now doubt about whether Frist can assert effective leadership. Now that his power has been tested and found wanting -- and found wanting twice -- no one is afraid of him anymore. The next ten days… will be a very dangerous period for Frist.\"Dr. Frist just got the political equivalent of having an oncologist arrange for you to have a biopsy on a Friday afternoon. Something tells me this isn’t going to be the cheeriest of Memorial Days at the Frist household. Karyn, maybe you should do the barbecuing. How about cooking up a face-saving exit strategy? I hear running for president takes up an awful lot of time…Read More05.28.2005 Sean DanielHere\u0027s something else we are going to do that I ask all readers of the Huffington Post and as many others as possible to do as well: make generous donations to the many organizations that are helping the families of those in the military, the wounded who are returning and members of the service with needs that the Gov\u0027t seems a little too strapped to cover.read whole post | permalink05.27.2005 Jim LampleyThere\u0027s a $25 million bounty on al Zarqawi\u0027s head, and the Iraqi government supported by American troops can\u0027t induce anyone to tip us off as to where he might be. How long do you think a fugitive would last in America with that price on his soul? American Commanders in Vietnam used to scratch their heads in wonder that Vietcong soldiers would crawl for miles underground to fight them and die. That kind of emotional fuel isn\u0027t something we easily comprehend.read whole post | permalink | comments (17)05.27.2005 Richard CarlsonThe federal Government, after spending many billions on the nation’s defense against terrorism has devised a strategic plan to keep this from EVER happening again. It doesn’t rely on expensive and cranky technology. It is a model of simplicity, to wit: A large cardboard sign, to be waved from the open door of a Black Hawk helicopter flying alongside any errant plane. In Magic Marker it will say “Follow Me. Now!”read whole post | permalink05.27.2005 Robert SchlesingerEspecially in Washington, we\u0027ve lost the ability to conceive that The Other Side might not share certain fundamental conceptions about the world. Deep down, we like to think that everyone has the same basic conceptions of the world, and in this case politics, as we do. So when The Other Side advocates a policy with which we don\u0027t agree, they\u0027re not simply wrong but maliciously so because they know better.read whole post | permalink | comments (12)05.27.2005 Harry ShearerIt seems like a familiar story -- a family reduced to near-hysterics in the long-running campaign to save their daughter, now tearfully denouncing a judge who seems deaf to their pleas, and a country riveted by the spectacle. Except it\u0027s happening now, halfway around the world, and the girl in question is languishing not in a hospice but in an Indonesian jail.read whole post | permalink | comments (14)05.27.2005 Thomas de ZengotitaThe \"culture wars\" really are about culture -- and that means they are about self-definition. That\u0027s why the line between news and entertainment blurred. The media landscape fused into one vast arena for contesting identities. Performers in that arena, from bloggers to pop music stars to politicians, are just that -- performers. And they have learned to give the fans what they want. Self-affirmation. Vindication.read whole post | permalink | comments (0)05.27.2005 Jay GordonMy generation’s drugs were bad enough but now we have millions of kids and teens taking prescription drugs that have never been tested adequately on those age groups. The short-term issues are tough but the long-term consequences are being grossly underestimated as the pharmaceutical industry pursues profit and parents and educators look for easy ways out. (OK, not everything the pharmas do is evil and not every teacher wants the whole classroom on speed, but sometimes it feels that way from where I sit.)read whole post | permalink05.27.2005 Richard BradleyAt a media conference yesterday, Martin Nisholz, president of New York Times Digital, defended his company\u0027s decision to start charging $50 for online access to the Times\u0027 archives. Nisenhold said: \"For the cost of roughly two and a half martinis, you can have access to the entire archives.\" Hmmm...I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m not throwing back $20 martinis. If Nisholz is, the Times is either a) paying him too much, or b) needs to give his expense account a closer look.read whole post | permalink | comments (5)05.27.2005 Josh SilverMillions are taking action to block media consolidation, protect PBS from partisan gamesmanship, ensure competitive, affordable Internet access, and promote independent media that questions – rather than promotes – the powers that be.read whole post | permalink05.27.2005 Greg GutfeldScott and I were reading HUFFPOO again, and all this talk about stem cells has made us hungry! So, we\u0027ve decided to have a barbecue this Saturday at our place! We don\u0027t have a backyard, but if we open all the windows in the basement, we\u0027re sure to get a breeze going!

Still, I wonder whether the Jews/pandering item might be sarcasm gone awry. Being susceptible to pandering, of course, is not a survival trait -- it\u0027s usually harmful to one\u0027s survival. That itself suggests that her statement was meant sarcastically, to suggest that in fact a group as savvy as we Jews are (and, hey, we are pretty savvy) can see right through all this pandering.read whole post | permalink05.27.2005 Danielle CrittendenI\u0027ve never understood why women’s groups weren\u0027t out front cheering the wars against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein\u0027s Iraq. Were there ever more feminist wars than these? You\u0027d think the National Organization for Women would be egging the administration on to Saudi Arabia and Iran. But no...read whole post | permalink | comments (67)05.27.2005 Norm OrnsteinEvery president, every leader makes choices about life that involve tradeoffs; those choices, in war and in health research embrace the concept that the deliberate and direct loss of some lives in order to save others, or in order to preserve great principles like liberty, are morally acceptable and even morally required.read whole post | permalink | comments (8)05.27.2005 Max BlumenthalIt\u0027s time to change tunes a little, Hitchens. I\u0027ll let you take a cocktail break if you\u0027re getting tired. Because the next song is a blithe waltz called, \"Dinner with the Denier.\" It\u0027s about your innocent fox-trots with infamous Holocaust denier David Irving. In 1994, you held a dinner for Irving at your home in Washington. Who was there? What did you say to Irving to charm him? What drinks were served? Schnapps?Dance, Hitchens, dance.
