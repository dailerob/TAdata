{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostThe rich just keep getting richer -- not only by gobbling up more income, but also by paying less in taxes. That means less support for the poor, who are getting increasingly poorer relative to the top 1 percent. One chart in a new study of income inequality in developed nations, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, puts this in stark relief. It shows that the more top tax rates are cut, the greater the share of national income that is mopped up by the wealthiest citizens. And of course perhaps no country illustrates this better than the United States, which is at the extremes of income inequality and tax cuts for the wealthy. The only other nation that even comes close is the United Kingdom, which was hijacked by \"trickle-down economics\" at about the same time as the U.S., back in the 1980s under Reagan and Thatcher.Comments (764)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhether you need to conceal those tan lines for a backyard wedding, or you want to wear the season\u0027s hottest colors for that picnic in the park, we\u0027ve got you covered. After all, there\u0027s a lot more to summer style than pulling out those white shoes.CommentsBrenda PetersonBrendaPetersonBooks.comMaybe we\u0027re asking the wrong question by just focusing on whether these haunting CGI merpeople are real or myth. The real question is: Why are we making our oceans too dangerous to sustain all life?Comments (110)Dianne K. SalerniTeacher, AuthorThe moment I saw the photograph--a grave enclosed in an iron cage--I knew there was a book in it for me.Comments (381)Aaron GouveiaBlogger, The Daddy FilesGuys see the low bar set for dads on commercials and TV shows and will only rise high enough to meet it. And when their wives dress the baby in a shirt that basically calls them idiots, they\u0027ll soon learn they\u0027re expected to be know-nothing dolts, so there\u0027s no need to improve.Comments (753)Russell BrandActor and comedianExtremists on both sides have a shared agenda: division, distrust, anger and violence. The answer is not for us to move further from one another, crouched in opposing fortresses constructed from vindictive words. We need now to move closer to one another, to understand one another.Comments (154)Tom Zeller Jr.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostIn an American political system so perfectly polarized by corporate lobbying and petty self-preservation, leadership on Keystone has so far proved to be evasive and dithering -- a perfect combination for the global novelty betting market.Comments (20)Sheryl SandbergChief Operating Officer, FacebookNo matter what route you choose personally, I am writing to appeal to you to take on a critically important cause that will improve the lives of all: building a more equal world.Comments (132)Harvey FiersteinMultiple Tony-Award-winning actorWhen we excuse homophobia as a matter of opinion instead of treating it as a destructive social illness, we invite fear to explode into violence. How often are the perpetrators of hate-crimes discovered to be self-loathing? Valued individuals do not strike out against strangers.Comments (28)Judith Natelli McLaughlinPoet, author, lover of wordsToday\u0027s post is about what not to say to a pregnant woman. The first three are from personal experience. The next two are questions that you need to just trust me on -- don\u0027t ask.Comments (87)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkSome would like to believe that because we now have a black president, that we no longer have a need to push for civil rights or equality. Nothing could be further from the truth.Comments (13)Karen MorganPlaintiff, \u0027McLaughlin v. Panetta\u0027I have a flag that I\u0027m technically not allowed to have: the flag that was draped over my wife\u0027s coffin at her funeral. It is military custom to present that flag to the spouse of a fallen soldier, but our marriage doesn\u0027t exist in the eyes of the government that she served for 17 years.Comments (419)Andrew BacevichAuthor, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027Although Washington seems in no hurry to name its nameless war, perhaps we should jump-start the process. Let\u0027s consider some possible options, names that might actually explain what\u0027s going on.Comments (115)Murray LippSocial justice activistThere is no logical or reasonable basis for denying same-sex couples access to secular marriage laws. Opposing the inevitable (marriage equality) is a waste of time, money and energy.Comments (405)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillThe all-too-frequent failure of political media to report accurately and with appropriate context is an ongoing disaster for our country. The Washington Post this weekend offered a particularly dismaying entry in this regard.Comments (11)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe real health care battle in this country isn\u0027t the one being fought over the bill everyone now calls \"Obamacare.\" The real battle is the one millions of Americans face every day as they struggle to pay medical bills that now average nearly $10,000 per year -- if they\u0027re \"lucky.\"Comments (228)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.If you are locked into an ideology that government is bad, you have a stake in proving that to be the case. Whether a gridlock-committed Republican party will pay a price for opposing the will of the people remains to be seen. It\u0027s up to the American people to decide what they want.Comments (399)Christopher RosenEntertainment editor, Huffington PostEverything presented in this resurrected version of \"Arrested Development\" points to a show that still very clearly has gas left in the tank. Further adventures of the Bluth family -- whether on Netflix or the big screen -- are more than welcome. Which doesn\u0027t make Season 4 any less disappointing.Comments (123)Norman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027The \"war on terror\" was built on two tiers of grief. Momentous and meaningless. Ours and theirs. The domestic politics of grief settled in for a very long haul, while perpetual war required the leaders of both major parties to keep affirming and reinforcing the two tiers of grief.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027My modest suggestion that governments become the agents of their citizens in bargaining with global capital should hardly raise an eyebrow. But capitalist tools are acting worried that average citizens may be starting to see what\u0027s really going on.Comments (666)Ann U. WrightLeader, Half the Sky Movement\u0027s college ambassador programTo counter sexist attitudes, we must move away from advocacy against sexual assault as a specifically female cause. We must foster male attitudes that recognize and reject violence towards women.Comments (35)Philip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America\u0027Controlling health care costs is not possible without addressing the distrust that unreliable medical justice fuels. The question is: How long will the public be willing to pay for that unnecessary waste?CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Not content with having swindled tens of millions of Americans out of their homes and life savings, the very bankers who caused the biggest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression are now subverting government regulations designed to prevent comparable disasters in the future.Comments (68)Heather Bauer, RD, CDNNutritionist, Author, EntrepreneurMany new organizations, including the Non-GMO Project, are on a mission to preserve non-GMO products, and increase the awareness through food labeling. Want to be part of the non-GMO bandwagon? Here are my top five reasons to let go of GMOs.Comments (71)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThere is an age-old tradition in this country: if you don\u0027t like a law and can\u0027t get rid of it, look for a loophole. That\u0027s what some companies that don\u0027t want to comply with an important Obamacare requirement have done, and it appears they\u0027ve hit pay dirt.Comments (58)Pharrell Williams and Connie YowellThe days of unequal access to high quality educators, schools in crisis and communities feeling powerless to support them are soon coming to an end.Comments (13)Steven CohenExecutive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteNo politician wants to argue that the absence of debt means that we are not investing in the future. The recent collapse of a bridge in \"good repair\" on Interstate 5 in Washington reminds us of our inability to make choices and take care of basic needs.Comments (28)Jennifer Merolla Ph.D.Associate Professor, Department of Politics and Policy, Claremont Graduate UniversityOur own research on this topic suggests that the public is likely to remain supportive of aggressive foreign policy, including drone strikes, in a context in which the Boston marathon bombings and other recent events have increased the salience of terrorism.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghEagerly chomping at the bit, the would-be candidates are inspired by the surprise outcome of recent races won by dark horses with scant track records. The American Dream that anyone can become president has been realized -- literally.CommentsRoger HickeyCo-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureA political mobilization by citizens is clearly necessary to prevent politicians in the Senate and House from embracing the corporate version of corporate tax reform.Comments (54)Leslie ZemeckisActress, Writer\"For too long these burlesque girls have been held down on the low rung of the entertainment ladder . . . but no more\" declared Dixie Evans, the former Marilyn Monroe of Burlesque. Dixie and I have set out to change the perception of how old-time burlesque is viewed.Comments (114)Taylor Cole Miller, 2013.28.05Jason Salzman, 2013.28.05Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.28.05Santiago Halty, 2013.28.05Bill Bush, 2013.28.05Christopher Holshek, 2013.28.05Michael Calderone, 2013.28.05Martha Flumenbaum, 2013.28.05Hilde Johnson, 2013.28.05Joshua Kors, 2013.28.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"GOP COURT FREAKOUT!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
