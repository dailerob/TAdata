{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressThe Iowa caucuses, mercifully, are over. The votes are in, the winners have declared victory and the people who finished third are also sort of declaring victory for some reason. The delegates have been apportioned -- or, more precisely, a teensy number of the thousands of delegates the eventual winner will need to collect have been apportioned. But how do we make sense of what happened? As always, we look to the media for \"takeaways.\" There are a lot for you to sample this Tuesday, but which are the hottest and most yummy? Herewith, Eat The Press offers the definitive ranking of the major Iowa takeaways, chosen by a scientific process of being correct about stuff.Given the rise of Trump and Sanders, anger could prove to be the driving force of the primaries. If so, November could pose an even more consequential question: against whom is this anger to be directed? And how?Journalist and authorFlint\u0027s urban renewal program turned Black homeowners into public housing tenants, and no long-term assistance was at hand to recompense their loss of wealth. Rather, they were met with a hardening of the city\u0027s color line. Like cigarettes, American state policies are hazardous to Black health. When used as directed, they cause harm.Associate Professor of Africana Studies and Human Ecology at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.\"The real world we\u0027re living in\" right now won\u0027t allow fundamental change of the sort we need. It takes a movement. Such a movement is at the heart of the Sanders campaign. The passion that\u0027s fueling it isn\u0027t really about Bernie Sanders. Had Elizabeth Warren run, the same passion would be there for her. It\u0027s about standing up to the moneyed interests and restoring our democracy.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027More than 1.6 million Americans will receive a cancer diagnosis this year and approximately 595,690 people will die from this devastating disease -- that\u0027s 1,632 moms and dads, sons and daughters, grandparents, siblings and friends every day.U.S. Representative to Congress (D -- MI)The Iowa caucuses were a victory for pundits. But many will continue to mislead about what\u0027s really going on this election -- or be oblivious to its realities.Editor/Publisher of Inside Michigan PoliticsFebruary 2016 marks the 90th anniversary of a unique ritual in American and world history. For the next month, America will be challenged to contemplate the global and national journey and achievements of its African-descended residents.The premiere online magazine destination for African-American cultural insight, news and perspective.An adult choosing to play football in the NFL for a nice salary is a completely different situation than adults allowing children with developing brains to play.Author, How We Can Save Sports: A Game PlanA phony painting causes tears, fury and ruin.?Contributing editor, Vanity FairIronically, Sanders, Cruz and Trump all make similar arguments: the system is rigged against average Americans; special interests and political \"cronies\" are reaping the rewards; and nothing short of a massive overhaul is in order. Extreme populism has been on the rise in Europe, and these candidates are attempting to foment a similar sentiment in the U.S.Communications strategist; former National Press Secretary, Obama 2012 campaign\"Luna,\" was captured by ISIS fighters when they swept through northern Iraq in August 2014. She was sold four times and raped by all her \"owners.\" She was one of hundreds of Yezidi women and girls who had similar experiences.Women’s rights researcher for the Middle East and North Africa region, Human Rights WatchRight now, there are only two competing stories out there about the devolving situation in the Middle East. The Obama administration suggests that we have to \"defend\" America by gradually ratcheting up our efforts, while Republican candidates for president urge us to \"defend\" ourselves by bombing IS to smithereens.Blogger at MythicAmerica.usIt\u0027s starting to look like the volume of the public\u0027s outcry and the force of its anger has breached in opening in Washington\u0027s ironclad do-nothing status quo. Last week, in a rare show of agreement, liberals and conservatives in Washington, D.C. came together and agreed that money\u0027s corrosive influence on our politics is a crisis that must be fixed today.Executive Director, Issue OneBy addressing how our responses to survivors play a critical role in the healing process, these women show that dealing with sexual assault should not be an individual\u0027s burden alone, but a collective responsibility we embrace with compassion and the utmost care.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWhile it\u0027s true that anger associated with financial insecurity is feeding both the right and left this election year, it seems there is a place beyond anger, a place where powerlessness makes anger feel irrelevant, such is the dissociation with the political process.Artist/writer, The Greyhound Diaries project — a 110,000-mile journey in song, story, and imageWe have seen the anguish of families again and again, the anguish graven on the face of our president as, again and again, he strives to offer consolation knowing that there is none. Worse, perhaps, is knowing the reason.Novelist and contributing opinion writerSmoking addiction is a contagious disease spread by tobacco companies through high-nicotine cigarettes. Evidence suggests that lowering nicotine levels is an important way to give smokers a better chance to escape the trap set for them by addiction.Smoking cessation expertSince the moment the Bernie Sanders campaign began there has been no shortage of detractors in mainstream media. Self-appointed political sages have put his \"Democratic Socialism\" on trial and passed the verdict of \"unrealistic\" on his economic plan.Psychiatrist, interfaith harmony proponent.The Federal Housing Finance Agency and DOJ have obtained more than $36 billion in fines from 18 major financial institutions, including banks like JP Morgan and Bank of America. However, stunningly, not one individual has been indicted or charged civilly for the conduct that resulted in these massive fines.Served as Chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry CommissionRather than distracting us from our daily concerns, the local burden of hosting the Super Bowl is refocusing attention on our city\u0027s greatest challenge -- the fast growing gap between rich and poor.San Francisco Supervisor and candidate for State SenateDonald Trump, the New York billionaire seeking the Republican nomination for president, achieved something monumental in Monday night\u0027s Iowa caucuses. He became the very thing he most despises: a loser.Political and Pop Culture AnalystLet\u0027s step back for a moment and consider what a Christian Nation with Christian Laws based on a strict literalist interpretation of the Bible would mean for LGBT people.Director of Advocacy, SPARTAAs a journalist, I wrote stories about complete strangers. But as a man, my own story was incomplete. I never knew my dad. That changed on Friday, January 13, 2006.Communications Strategist | StorytellerWe are living through the greatest \"wealth grab\" in history. But inequality is not produced by immutable forces. It\u0027s the result of a legislative agenda promoted by the rich and executed by their political allies.Writer/Editor, Bernie 2016If the government actually paid for the research, not just at the early phases but through the clinical testing and FDA, then there would be no reason for patent monopolies. Drugs could be sold in a free market just like toothpicks and plastic cups.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027This long-awaited trip penciled on the president\u0027s itinerary comes during a critical time for members of the Islamic faith. The visit will not be a magic bullet to cure every problem or resolve every grievance. But it will go a long way to restore faith in American ideals.Civil, Human, \u0026 Women\u0027s Rights Activist | Blogger | DivergentI\u0027ve got some good news and some bad news. The good news is that presidential candidates are starting to talk about Internet issues. The bad news is that presidential candidates are starting to talk about Internet issues.Senior Director of Strategy, Free Press and Free Press Action FundReversing the seemingly continuous stream of hatred directed towards Muslims requires fostering a deeper understanding of Islam among Americans, and so I offer to you a page from my Muslim dictionary.Student.
