{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorThe Long Goodbye devolved into a waiting game in which the key and only question was: What’s he waiting for? And if Biden\u0027s heart really was never in it, then why, indeed, was he taking so long? The only possible explanation we can infer was that he was waiting for Clinton’s candidacy to implode. Biden\u0027s best buddy, President Barack Obama, praised him on “60 Minutes” recently as a great vice president, but declined to tout him as a unique presidential candidate.

The departure looks, at least in part, like the result of naked political calculation. Which is not how Biden or his friends wanted him to exit the electoral stage.I believe it is wrong, and, yes, un-American, to say that a person\u0027s faith is a disqualifying factor, the same way it was wrong when some Americans declared that John F. Kennedy could not be trusted to be president because he was Catholic.Founder, People for the American WayThe events of 9/11 changed everything. Because the United States had designated the PKK a terrorist organization in 1997 -- six years after Ibrahim had come to the United States -- the Bush administration denied his naturalization petition and initiated deportation proceedings against him.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoLast Tuesday, five Democrats took the stage in the party\u0027s first national debate. There were differences no doubt.

We need to begin to ask the deeper, more probing questions behind their desperate, extreme acts.Jazz singer/songwriter; granddaughter of Norman RockwellAs part of his campaign to appear to be an honest broker within the party, Ryan has carefully cultivated the image of being a serious \"thinker\" and \"policy wonk\" and, for the most part, the mainstream media have taken the bait.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeDonald Trump has opened the floodgates to lies about immigration. Here are the myths, and the facts.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Do you want your tax dollars to go to companies in countries like Brunei, where unmarried women who get pregnant are sent to prison and gays and lesbians are sentenced to death by stoning?President, National Organization for WomenHer strong showing in the debate began this trend, and if Biden\u0027s supporters put her comfortably over 50 percent in the Democratic race, the trend may become irreversible.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWe should avoid the trap of seeing Russian involvement in Syria solely through the prism of our bilateral rivalry.

Director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center.At a time when both left and right have begun to agree on the needless financial and human costs of mass incarceration, the State of Texas is conspiring with the Obama administration to undermine a federal court order so they can keep innocent children in prison.Executive Director, ACLU of TexasObama has \"DirectTV,\" Carson has \"cable,\" and apparently, the American people have no class. Just because these women have husbands that have chosen a life in the public eye, serving the public, does not make them fair game for sexist jokes and offensive comparison.| iowan | cyclone | grammar nerd | listener of audio books | feminist | political junkie | cat mom || farmer’s daughter | Gemini \u0026 real-life twinGiven the nature of the show, it\u0027s meant to have disturbing moments, but using rape as a tool to be edgy makes the show problematic and, quite frankly, boring. Relying on rape is a trope that Murphy and Falchuk have used before in every incarnation of the \"American Horror Story\" franchise.Voices Editorial FellowThere exists a future of artificial intelligence, rampant inequality and irreversible climate change.
