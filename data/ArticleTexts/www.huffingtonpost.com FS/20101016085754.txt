{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"We finally found out the real problem with the mainstream media: They\u0027re agnostic on sanity. That\u0027s the only conclusion that can be drawn from the refusal of mainstream-media organizations to allow their employees to attend Jon Stewart\u0027s Rally to Restore Sanity.

This media groupthink explains a lot -- including why we find ourselves in a time and place in our country in which a rally to restore sanity is even necessary. Taking a stand for sanity is neither right nor left. It\u0027s reasonable. That\u0027s why HuffPost is providing buses for people who need a ride to the rally. At the moment, more than 10,000 people have signed up to allow us to drive them sane. Yes, that will be a lot of buses -- but there\u0027s a lot of sanity to restore.Read Post | CommentsBill Maher, 10.15.2010Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"To me, the Brett Favre story isn\u0027t about sports or sex or how necessary caller ID is -- it\u0027s about how pathetic and clueless white American males have become.Read Post | CommentsLawrence Lessig, 10.15.2010Professor of Law, Harvard Law School; Director of the Edmond J.
