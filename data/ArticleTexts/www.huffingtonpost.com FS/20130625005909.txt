{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of Al Huffington Post Maghreb, a French-language edition of The Huffington Post covering the Maghreb countries -- Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. Just last month we launched our first Asian edition, in Japan, and now we\u0027re thrilled to be bringing The Huffington Post to Africa, inviting people in the Maghreb to add their voices to the growing global conversation. And there is a tremendous opportunity for Al Huffington Post Maghreb to do its part to contribute to the consolidation of the region\u0027s young democracy. It\u0027s an opportunity underscored by the countless bloggers already at work in the region, at a time when free expression is not a given, but more of a work in progress. The changes in the region have created a new generation of citizens, electrified by all the new possibilities. And Al Huffington Maghreb wants to tell and share their stories.Comments (42)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m in Aspen for the inaugural 21st Century National Service Summit, sponsored by The Franklin Project, a new venture of the Aspen Institute. The goal is to make universal national service a new American rite of passage. It is, of course, an idea at the heart of the founding of the country itself, connected to the very \"pursuit of happiness\" in our Declaration of Independence.Comments (11)Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsWhat happened in Albany last week has major implications for national anti-corruption efforts that are central to making progress on the issues that you care about most, yet keep losing. Health care, climate change, education, financial oversight, military spending... the list goes on.Comments (40)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostAs it so often has in the past, \"Mad Men\" took my expectations and subverted them as it expanded my idea of what the show could do or be. I\u0027m still picking my jaw up off the floor.Comments (372)Kader A. AbderrahimEditorial Director, HuffPost MaghrebAl Huffington Post Maghreb is a news website with a dual purpose: to deliver \"hot\" news, occurring every day, happy or sad, serious or light-hearted. We will do this with ambition and professionalism, while seeking a unique approach to make this information more attractive.CommentsEllen Johnson-SirleafPresident of Liberia; Nobel Peace Prize Winner 2011People often ask me if I feel pressure as the first democratically elected female leader of an African nation. It\u0027s a fair question, but the pressure I feel should be the same felt by all African leaders: to improve the lives of Africans.CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolI have outrage envy. For nearly two weeks, more than a million citizens across Brazil have taken to the streets to protest political corruption, economic injustice, poor health care, inadequate schools, lousy mass transit, a crumbling infrastructure and billions blown on sports.Comments (19)Terry Gaspard, MSW, LICSWLicensed Clinical Social Worker and College InstructorWhy is the pursuer- distancer pattern so common and destructive to relationships? It makes sense that the power struggle for emotional intimacy often plays itself out in the bedroom.Comments (551)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe United States Supreme Court held today in Fisher v. University of Texas that diversity is a compelling governmental interest for a public university to seek, but there are significant restrictions to employing race based measures in doing so.Comments (40)Emilie AriesDigital strategist, organizer and founder, Bossed UpIf we\u0027re ever going to be able to \"make your partner a real partner,\" like Sheryl Sandberg advocates, we\u0027ve got to believe that men who love women who love their careers exist -- and know that we can attract them by not glossing over our achievements when we\u0027re dating.Comments (25)Tucker Max#1 New York Times Best Selling author of \"I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell\"When I interview someone, I tell them I don\u0027t care about their résumé. I only care about two things. I don\u0027t want to know anything else, because everything else is puffery, status signaling, or bullshit.CommentsAri MelberMSNBC Co-Host, AttorneyThe logic of Justice Kennedy\u0027s decision is bad news for affirmative action. It\u0027s just incrementally and bureaucratically bad -- not necessarily bad today.CommentsPaul RieckhoffFounder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaThe debate about the VA disability claims backlog has been about many things, but for us, it\u0027s first and foremost about the hundreds of thousands of veterans facing an enduring and straining wait. These people are more than just about numbers.CommentsGene D. BlockChancellor of UCLAMonday\u0027s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court may leave us all waiting to see what the case of a Texas woman challenging her state\u0027s affirmative action laws means for all of us in higher education, but there is reason to be hopeful.Comments (52)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Petitioning the media to change its budget reporting might be outside the standard scope of action among progressives, but it is a well-defined action that could make a real difference. Much of our budget debate today is complete nonsense in large part because the public is so poorly informed.CommentsDonna Rockwell, PsyDLicensed clinical psychologist, leading mindfulness meditation teacher, specialist in celebrity mental health, and activist in contemporary humanistic psychologyWhat is the secret to accessing personal power? How does one go beyond fear and self-doubt to triumph in the end? Where does the feeling of power really come from? And how can a person find it for him or herself?CommentsMark Hyman, MDPracticing physicianWith all the new diet trends that seem to spring up daily, it\u0027s not surprising many people are confused about what to eat. At the end of the day, all diets use a gimmick or trick to make you focus on how to change your eating habits to be healthier.Comments (68)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorStimulus comes and goes, as it should. The fact that it creates some drag when it departs is fine, as long as we get the timing right. The problem is when you screw up the timing, and that\u0027s what it looks like we\u0027re doing -- again.Comments (63)HRH The Prince of WalesHRH The Prince of WalesJust as we are what we eat, I believe we are what we are surrounded by. The art of place-making was all but dead, as was the skill of creating genuine communities rather than rather soulless housing estates, until I determined to revive these timeless skills over 25 years ago.Comments (183)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerAlmost all of what we do on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Google was predicted, some might even say preordained, by an ancient race of wizards and warriors in the 1970s and 1980s. I\u0027m talking about Multi User Dungeons (MUDs) and the activity of Mudding.Comments (38)Tom Zeller Jr.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostIn his new book, Michael Levi reveals the historical context and highlights how rapid and revolutionizing changes in the nation\u0027s energy portfolio are once again afoot.Comments (50)William K. BlackAssoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleIt is bizarre that the Obama administration, which purports to support most of Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa\u0027s economic policies, shares Heritage\u0027s implacably hostility to the Correa administration.Comments (236)Jerry DeWittAuthor, \u0027Hope after Faith: An Ex-Pastor\u0027s Journey from Belief to Atheism\u0027There was no one particular event, no one particular day when faith suddenly disappeared. Over the course of 25 years, my ever-reasoning conscious forcibly stripped blind-faith from my heart one layer at a time, until to my surprise, it was completely gone.Comments (38)Seth D. HarrisActing Secretary of Labor for the United StatesA higher minimum wage provides a shot in the arm to an economy powered above all by consumer demand. When working families have more money in their pockets, they don\u0027t stash it in offshore bank accounts in the Cayman Islands -- they pump it back into their local economies.Comments (113)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027I\u0027ll take Netroots over Yippies and Weathermen any day. What I observed was lots of amazingly creative, funny, principled, affirming, joyous people, mostly young, and lots of movements making a difference. And yet the movements don\u0027t quite aggregate to a Movement.Comments (109)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarUltimately, what kids watch isn\u0027t up to the MPAA. In truth, the responsibility for monitoring children\u0027s viewing of films lies with parents, who should investigate movies thoroughly before introducing them to any underage child.Comments (196)Chip WardEnvironmental activistI assume you understand by now that you woke up this morning on an overheated planet of slums threatened by ecological collapse. So instead, let\u0027s get right to the point: what do we do about it? How do we begin to heal the wounds?Comments (16)Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027With regard to our nation\u0027s illegal immigration problem, the goal should be to solve it -- not win some political battle. The solution must but be simple, not complex. So I thought I would take a stab at a simple, not perfect, solution for illegal immigration.Comments (266)William AstoreWriter, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceAmerica, land of the free! But not free health care. Pay up, you moocher! And if you should lose your job or if you\u0027re one of the millions of so-called underinsured ... bankruptcy.Comments (178)Brian WhettenLeadership consultant, author, conscious business coachWhere stress can lead to success, overstress is one of the primary predictors of failure. And perversely, the more committed we are to creating results, the larger this danger becomes.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Who is Netanyahu fooling, his cabinet and government, or the U.S. president and secretary of state? This is what John Kerry will have to discern as he attempts to move forward.Comments (377)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.24.06Shira Lazar, 2013.24.06Laura Krughoff, 2013.24.06Robert J.
