That\u0027s the belief behind the new jobs section we\u0027re launching today, Opportunity: What Is Working. In partnership with LinkedIn, Starbucks, Microsoft, The MCJ Amelior Foundation, The Ford Foundation, The Skoll Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, Startup America, Purpose.com, Valencia College, and NBC News, we are planning to use the national party conventions as powerful platforms for presenting what should be a fundamentally bipartisan issue: what we the people can do to accelerate job creation and fill job openings.
