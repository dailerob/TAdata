{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The Obamas\u0027 redecoration of the Oval Office is very cautious, neutral, inoffensive, neither one thing nor the other -- the Audacity of Taupe. But I applaud the switch from flowers to a bowl of fruit on the new coffee table. In times of great economic hardship, it makes a world of sense to be able to eat the centerpiece if necessary. However, the decision to festoon the new carpet with quotes from Lincoln, F.D.R., J.F.K., Teddy Roosevelt and Martin Luther King seems a tad Hallmark-y, and a little prepubescent -- something Sasha\u0027s fellow fourth graders might suggest (Malia\u0027s seventh-grade friends would probably find it \"lame\"). What\u0027s next, adding the doodle of a heart with \"Barack + Michelle\"?Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 09.02.2010Former Secretary of Labor, Professor at BerkeleyPay no attention to the stock market. The real economy is jobs and paychecks, what people buy and what they sell. And the real economy -- even viewed from a worldwide perspective -- is as precarious as ever, perhaps more so.Read Post | CommentsBrendan Nyhan, 09.01.2010Political scientist and media criticThe reality is that Obama\u0027s current standing -- and the rush to blame it on tactical failures -- could be predicted months ago based on structural factors. His approval ratings largely reflect a poor economy.Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 09.01.2010Publisher of \"The Washington Note\"What Barack Obama described in the 2008 campaign is what we are seeing unfold in the country. Guns and religion -- or, in other words, fear and intolerance.Read Post | CommentsNorman Solomon, 09.01.2010Author of War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to DeathWith his commitment to war in Afghanistan, President Obama is propagating an exculpatory view of any and all U.S. war efforts -- as if the immoral can become the magnificent by virtue of patriotic alchemy.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Lakoff, 09.02.2010Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics, Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!The Democrats cannot take their base for granted. Only moral leadership backed by actions and communicated effectively can excite the Obama base once more. Without that excitement, the Democrats will lose big.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 09.01.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowWhile everyone is focused on the crowd sizes or Glenn Beck\u0027s tall tale about holding in his bare hands George Washington\u0027s inaugural address at the National Archives, the more important questions ought to be about the money.Read Post | CommentsWill Bunch, 09.01.2010Author, \"The Backlash\"A push for job creation would bring work for many people now simmering in the toxic right-wing media bubble instead. The conditions fueling the Obama backlash may lift -- if we can somehow lift the conditions holding back America as a whole.Read Post | CommentsAmy B. Dean, 09.02.2010Co-Author, \"A New New Deal: How Regional Activism Will Reshape the American Labor Movement\"This Labor Day, I propose we think less about the material gains that working Americans have secured. Instead, we should consider the values that organized labor embodies that we might hope to pass along to our children.Read Post | CommentsSaul Austerlitz, 09.01.2010Author, Another Fine Mess: A History of American Film ComedyIn our era of deflated discourse, the good humor and cynicism of political comedy makes the ideal tonic.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 09.01.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureAs a deregulation romance novel, hedge-fund manager Daniel Loeb\u0027s \"investor letter\" is a bodice-ripper.

Hadar, 09.01.2010Journalist and foreign affairs analystPresident Barack Obama is continuing to reorient U.S. foreign policy in general, and in the Middle East in particular, along the lines of the internationalist/neo-realist approach pursued in the pre-9/11 yearsRead Post | CommentsSimon Jenkins, 09.01.2010Writer for the Guardian and the London Sunday TimesThe west is leaving Iraq in a pool of blood, dust and dollars.
