{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, politicians, writers, activists and nonprofit leaders are gathered in Davos, Switzerland for the 43rd annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. While the issues to be addressed range from healthcare to regulation to the environment, the two of us share an interest in one particular topic -- economic growth and job creation. The Huffington Post and Goldman Sachs come at this issue with different perspectives, but a common goal. So today, our two organizations are joining forces to examine what entrepreneurs are doing to drive growth around the world and apply the lessons we have learned. Based on the experience of Goldman Sachs\u0027 10,000 Women initiative and HuffPost\u0027s commitment to showcasing \"What Is Working,\" we are appearing together today in Davos to open up the conversation about helping to build a global economy that not only grows but also provides much greater opportunities and prosperity to women and men alike.Read Post | Comments (226)Bob Cesca, 01/24/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe whole notion of an armed revolt and secession from the United States failed miserably in 1865, and the revolutionaries at that time were headed by skilled West Point commanders like J.E.B.

Andrea Bocelli was working as a lawyer in Italy when he was discovered. Harrison Ford worked for years as a carpenter before getting his big break. And Julia Child was 40 before she ever took a cooking lesson.Read Post | Comments (39)Allison Tate, 01/24/13Author, mother of fourI like him the way he is, and more importantly, he likes himself the way he is.Read Post | Comments (92)Trita Parsi, 01/24/13President, National Iranian American CouncilMindful of the short and closing window of opportunity for an intermediate agreement on the nuclear issue -- before the Iranian New Year in March and the Iranian elections in June -- time has not been used effectively since Obama\u0027s reelection in November.

But they also illustrate that those who violate rights are being challenged head-on by women.Read Post | CommentsIan Bremmer, 01/24/13Author, \u0027Every Nation for Itself\u0027In Davos, we see firsthand that the sunny and the snowy can co-exist.
