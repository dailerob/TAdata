{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027China\u0027s move shows us that currency values really are simple. For years, the Obama administration has been telling its supporters that it would like for China to raise the value of its currency, but they just refuse to budge. This doesn\u0027t sound very plausible. A week ago China\u0027s currency was about 4 percent higher relative to the dollar than it is today. Is there nothing that President Obama could have offered China to persuade it to not devalue its currency? Suppose he said that he didn\u0027t care about increased market access for the U.S. financial industry to China\u0027s market, a longstanding goal in trade? How about if Obama said that he would not push for respecting Pfizer\u0027s drug patents or Microsoft\u0027s copyright on Windows?I\u0027m excited to announce the launch of The Huffington Post\u0027s newest international edition, HuffPost Australia. The 15th edition in our growing global network, HuffPost Australia will be dedicated to producing great original reporting about the critical issues that Australians face.We know women and older Australians are the two fastest-growing groups in the workforce. And that at the same time the future economy wants us to have more babies now, the government doesn\u0027t want to pay for maternity leave. Securing a spot in a decent childcare centre is like finding the golden goose.Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost AustraliaMany thoughtful progressives in the Democratic Party, myself included, are suffering from a feeling of helplessness these days. We believe the Party is headed for defeat under the banner of Hillary, whose poll numbers are already not looking good. We fear disaster but have not seen a better alternative.Robert W. Winner Professor of Law and the Humanities, and Director of the Schell Center for International Human Rights at Yale Law School.Stay-at-home mom is not a real job. At most places of employment, when you take lunch, you\u0027re actually allowed to feed yourself, not spend lunchtime preparing a meal for your boss, cutting it into painstakingly small pieces, while he screams at you for not moving faster.Wife, mom, avid sports fanIt\u0027s a term I\u0027ve always loathed, and one that\u0027s dogged just about every working mother I know, for decades. The stunningly naïve belief that once we women had The Vote, The Pill, No-Fault Divorce and Equal Pay, that we could now go about the business of having The Job, The Marriage, The Kids, The Home we wanted, and -- some sanity.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Australia, and host of TodayAfter a dozen years as administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes and many years as a journalist and professor, I retired last August into a life of creative dabbling on the Upper West Side. Then, the renowned American Museum of Natural History began to misbehave.Retired administrator of the Pulitzer PrizesAdults who lived through the Cultural Revolution are only too aware of the mercurial horror of past Communist rule. A high school student told me that his father urged him to study in America because of the restrictions on freedom.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWhile Kasich and Bush certainly took a more measured tone in the first Republican debate compared to, say, Donald Trump, their policy positions and records as governor in Ohio and Florida show that they\u0027re just as extreme and far-right as the rest of the Republican field.Political Director, People For the American WayThe joke is long past over. With autumn closing in, it\u0027s getting harder to see how the short-fingered vulgarian of the American business world doesn\u0027t take his presidential odyssey at least to the gates of the GOP convention in Cleveland, if not beyond.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027How are Shari\u0027a laws in many of the Muslim-majority countries any different than ISIS\u0027s laws? Our broken tumultuous Muslim world has been morally corrupted and is largely void of justice. Saudi Arabia still flogs (beats with a whip or stick) people for expressing their God-given right to think. In Egypt, torture in the form of sexual assault, such as sodomizing men and raping female prisoners, is common practice.Imam; Founder and President, Muslims for Progressive ValuesTwo centuries ago, Thomas Jefferson\u0027s points were plain and clear: While this country desired peace, it had to be prepared to wage war; and yet the more it avoided resorting to raw military power, the more it would prosper. Have America\u0027s military officers learned these lessons?Retired lieutenant colonel (USAF)Our policies toward prescription drugs not only violate Mill\u0027s freedom principle, they are also absurdly irrational. Pharmaceutical companies are permitted to advertise their prescription drugs to clients who are not legally permitted to freely purchase them.Professor of Economics at American University in Washington, DC.Having failed to stop the bad news from leaking out of Egypt, Sisi is now turning to his religious authorities to stop Egyptians from reading the plain truth by using religious edicts. Sisi\u0027s use, or abuse, of Islam is becoming a defining feature of his oppressive rule.Editor, Middle East EyeWhether or not you agree with Trump, at a minimum his participation is forcing other candidates to clarify their positions on illegal immigration, and other issues. The media continually dismisses Trump, but whenever we hear more from Trump, we hear more from the other candidates, too.President, Tavakoli Structured FinanceI don\u0027t know if I broke a law of computing or committed heresy. But I installed Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro. I had feared that this would condemn me to purgatory in the gates of computing hell. But it has been an incredibly positive experience.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurI celebrate breastfeeding mothers everywhere. It\u0027s a tough and beautiful gig. I also celebrate those mothers who gave it a go and then made another choice -- because nothing is \"best\" for a baby if the mother is suffering.Mummy blogger who comes with a language warningDonald Trump dropped his long-awaited immigration position paper this week. To no one\u0027s surprise, it is a long list of restrictionist clichés about immigrants taking jobs, abusing welfare, and lowering wages for Americans. Here are the five biggest inaccuracies.Immigration Policy Analyst, Niskanen CenterEven parents who aren\u0027t looking to create the next Tiger Woods feel like they have no choice but to reluctantly buy into the trend. But does early specialization build a better athlete? Growing research suggests it doesn\u0027t.Freelance writer, blogger at EmpoweringParents.comIf you just woke up from a coma and read only the past week\u0027s headlines, you\u0027d be wondering when Clinton will be scheduling her concession speech, as she prepares to exit the race. That this is patent nonsense seems to have escaped everyone.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comSome have no idea what exists outside of their home town or village, and it\u0027s a privilege if we can turn this into a beautiful cultural exchange.Travel Blogger, Freelance Writer, \u0026 Photographer at TheBlogAbroad.com // Instagram: @glographicsLessig has said he would run as a Democrat and would choose someone like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders as his vice president. That person would take over and run the country once the reform agenda had passed. And that is precisely why his plan won\u0027t work, even if he miraculously was elected.Good government reformerMost people are familiar with some of the more common phobias, like flying, public speaking, small spaces, and spiders. Emetophobia, on the other hand, often doesn\u0027t feel like it is recognized as a legitimate fear.In real life and online, my words are often followed by exclamation points!I am so tired of the constant \"slut-shaming\" and female bashing I see all over social media. It\u0027s like feminism now requires all women to take on this responsibility of making sure every woman across the globe approves of her actions.JournalistThe contrast could not be greater between the violence in word and deed of so many modern day conservatives and the path Julian Bond forged to make a new way for us in this world.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersWhile mainstream feminism seems desperate to have in its fold a 19-year-old reality television star who is famous in no small part because her older sister\u0027s sex tape went viral, mainstream feminism rejects empowered women of faith.Author, Painted Hands; co-editor Faithfully FeministThe military was excited about these for many more reasons though: smart mines can hop and sense, and therefore the government could argue they\u0027re not land mines, they\u0027re smart robots. That means they aren\u0027t subject to the international anti-personnel landmine treaties. And since they can move, they\u0027re much harder to find and disarm. Great for war. Not so great for cleaning up after war.Author of Parenting for Technology Futures; Author of Robot Futures, Director of the CREATE Lab and Head of Robotics Master\u0027s at Carnegie Mellon University\u0027s Robotics InstituteThe high costs of health care in the United States challenge all stakeholders to focus special interventions on a subgroup of the population that is driving those expenditures: the sickest patients.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralI like that women think it\u0027s okay to make me go shopping with them. To ask about their dress and if it looks nice. To let their wrists fall limper when I\u0027m not so keen on it. I like men who hide themselves in changing rooms because my eyes may \"make them gay.\" I love it all.28-year-old writer from ScotlandWake up and ask yourself: how can I serve today? How can I embody love? How can I bring joy? How can I leave this world a better place? Have a spirit of service as you go about your day. Be a blessing, good company, an inspiration to others. You get more of what you give, so if you lack love, joy or abundance, find a way to help others find it. It will return to you a hundredfold.Writer and life coach at NotesOnBliss.com, your guidebook to happiness and creating a beautiful lifeAs a pediatrician, I get lots of questions from parents -- but sometimes I wish they would ask different ones.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
