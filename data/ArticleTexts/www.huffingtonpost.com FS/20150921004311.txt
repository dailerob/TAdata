{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, 23 million of us tuned in to watch a debate among what Mike Huckabee called \"The A-Team.\" He might be right, if the A stands for Alice in Wonderland, since through-the-looking-glass thinking was on full display. After multiple proud recitations of immigrant roots, the discussion moved on to how best to deport 11 million immigrants. And because Iran will treat the nuclear deal \"like toilet paper,\" we should rip it up on Day One. Or perhaps the A is for Apocalyptic, since, according to Fiorina, Day One should involve \"rebuilding the 6th Fleet\" -- of a military already bigger than those of the next 10 nations combined. But the biggest looking-glass moment came from Jeb Bush, who said \"there\u0027s one thing\" he knows \"for sure\" about his brother: \"he kept us safe.\" Well, yeah, except for...y\u0027know. Alice woke up from her dream - whether this A-Team will remains to be seen.From the beginning of his tenure as pope, Francis has used his position to change our conversations about what, and who, is important. In his words and his actions, he has challenged narratives and assumptions about the Catholic church, the world economic order, immigration, and the environment -- to name a few issues.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersHas our nation\u0027s top doctor, Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy, turned into a spin doctor? His latest public health initiative, the Step It Up campaign to promote walking, is so misleading that it\u0027s got me wondering whose health he\u0027s protecting: the American people\u0027s or the food and beverage industry\u0027s?Author, Producer, AdvocateAre they fools or fascists? Probably the former, but there was a disturbing cast to the second GOP debate, a vituperative jingoism reminiscent of the xenophobia that periodically scars western capitalist societies in moments of disarray.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027President Obama must know that it is impossible to protect the Arctic while allowing Shell to drill for oil 70 miles off the coast of Alaska.

Jeb Bush was a prep school pothead. And Donald Trump has neither the inclination nor the capacity to transcend his shtick and become a serious presidential candidate.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonIslamophobia, and probably racism, certainly played a role in Ahmed\u0027s ordeal, but the fact is overzealous administrators, zero-tolerance policies, and law enforcement officers ill-equipped to deal with schoolchildren have compromised educational environments throughout the country.Executive Director, ACLU of TexasReally? Are we really still defending -- and celebrating! -- the idea that sexual orientation is akin to some deep dark secret to be discussed after dark behind closed doors in hushed tones with only our most trusted confidantes?Editorial Director, The Huffington Post VoicesAmerica looks to her government and sees not themselves reflected in what Congress does, but someone else. They see not a Congress bending over backwards to answer the calls of average voters. They see a Congress bending over backwards to make calls to their funders. And who could really blame them?Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentThe SDGs and Universal Declaration should be a packaged deal. At UNGA, leaders will commit themselves to the former. But for that commitment to bear fruit, they must also rededicate themselves to the latter.President, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsUnless we act quickly, traffic crashes will rise from the world\u0027s ninth-leading cause of death today to the seventh-leading cause by 2030 -- which could claim as many as 1.8 million lives each year.Fmr. three-term mayor of New York City; Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LPJust because I think something is funny or appropriate, doesn\u0027t mean that all trans people feel the same way and vice versa. I can only speak from my own personal experience and in no way can I represent the entire trans community... There\u0027s no one way to be trans!Public speaker, activist, OlympianThis week marks the 7th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The anniversary of this collapse, September 15th, is the day set aside to ridicule the people who warned of a second Great Depression if the Treasury Department didn\u0027t rescue the Wall Street banks.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Our goal is to create a rallying cry that moves every American to step up and realize that the responsibility to prevent sexual assault begins with each of us. To end it requires a change in culture that demands everyone\u0027s engagement.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsIt is said of economists that they know the cost of everything but the value of nothing. In the case of the article \"Price Tag of Bernie Sanders\u0027s Proposals: $18 Trillion,\" this accusation is a better fit for the Wall Street Journal that published it.Professor of Economics, University of Massachusetts at AmherstChild homelessness is a stain on our society--the richest country in the world should not stand by as 2.5 million children are robbed of their futures. Addressing this problem requires we first acknowledge it exists--by counting every homeless child.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThe first thing you need to know about Saudi Arabia is that it is not a country but a financial and religious empire with a million poisonous tentacles stretching across both the West and the Muslim world.Writer, activist, J.D. candidate at Yale Law School.I\u0027m deeply concerned about America\u0027s young black generation, because if it were not for people who gave me support to be okay with an identity that has nothing to do with looking like or imitating a destructive life, I might mimicked negative stereotypes of violence shown in the media.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFormer CIA Director George Tenet believed the President\u0027s Daily Briefs to be so sensitive that none could be released for publication \"no matter how old or historically significant it may be.\" Yet, yesterday, the CIA declassified and released every PDB produced during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. So what\u0027s in the PDBs?WriterI would like to think that you did not intentionally offend a group of the one of the most trusted professions in both the United States and Canada, but you did. And for that, you owe us an apology.I am an average 24 year old gal with too much to say and lots on my mind, so I opened a blog to share my thoughts!The House and Senate sprinted off to vacation a few weeks ago with much undone, and thus have returned to a series of difficult deadlines that need to be addressed before the end of the month.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.At the age of 10, I was diagnosed with Alopecia, which is an autoimmune skin condition resulting in hair loss.

Why can\u0027t a skilled politician who is in a historic race to become the first female president manage to marry the two?Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Author, \u0027Timeless\u0027A rights regime -- and that is what the liberal state is -- is largely indifferent to the content of the rights being exercised and cares only that, when exercised, they leave room for the exercise of those same rights by others.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolIt\u0027s been a long, hot, f\u0027ed-up summer. Right, breeders?Hosts of The Pump and Dump Show: A Parentally Incorrect Comedy Show and Night Out, For OncePlanned Parenthood is under attack and it\u0027s up to all of us to fight back.

And, no matter the pundits\u0027 claims or the hopes of some gay activists, that holds true on LGBT rights as well.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostWhy would you willingly risk a child\u0027s life? Why would you risk your child being the reason a classmate gets sick or dies?Writer, philanthropist and blogger, The Spohrs Are MultiplyingWhat Donald Trump doesn\u0027t understand is this: Historically speaking, government antipoverty programs haven\u0027t weakened the work incentive.
