{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the nation got one last chance to see the Republicans debate before the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday. Of course, a certain bully chose not to attend, but that only allowed for the evening\u0027s highlight: watching Megyn Kelly conclusively prove that the way to prevail over a bully is to not back down. Having stood her ground all week against what in the opening question she called \"the elephant not in the room\" (one that had called her a \"bimbo\" and a \"lightweight\"), Kelly was, in fact, one of the night\u0027s big winners. Her charm and authority demolished Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio on their immigration hypocrisy. The other breakthrough came as Rand Paul addressed a much more serious elephant not in the room: the fact that \"the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community.\" As to who won overall it\u0027s hard to say, but you\u0027d have to start with the blonde, heavyweight moderator.A well-timed yes can expand our world in beautiful and unexpected ways. But I am writing now to espouse the power of another simple word: no.Actor, Author, Screenwriter, Director and ProducerIf the real intellectual and heart-cleansing message of Islam is not publicized or promoted, then the field is left to the belligerents and deadly aspirants of Armageddon. Why do beautiful things have such a hard time being noticed? Can\u0027t we try a bit harder to get back on that \"Peace Train\" again?Musician, Artist, Writer, Producer and PhilanthropistLast week more than 2,500 global leaders from more than 100 countries came together in Davos for the annual World Economic Forum. The dominant topic of discussion this year -- both inside the talks and panels and outside, as well -- was transition.Can we bomb a movement that has no nation but definitely has a strong belief system, like we used to have? Haven\u0027t we learned that every bomb creates terrorists?Actor; Founder, The Dreyfuss Civics InitiativeI will vote for Hillary with my head and my heart. I will be hopeful that a woman who does think before she speaks is not completely perceived as \"guarded,\" because a man who thinks before he speaks is called \"thoughtful.\"ActressThis wasn\u0027t an acid flashback, although to my ears it sounded like one. Several months ago, I was with 27,000 people screaming for a disheveled 73-year-old Senator from Vermont. He didn\u0027t look like Mick Jagger. But what Bernie Sanders says feels like the truth. The unbridled truth. And he says it LOUD.Founding member of The DoorsThe fourth industrial revolution is using digital technology to revolutionize almost every part of our life at an unprecedented pace. But one of the biggest implications is just how harmful this revolution may be to the progress of women because they are underrepresented in tech.CEO of YouTubeIf you want to help Flint, sign the petition, demand that the federal government take action, and then get involved yourself, wherever you live, so that this doesn\u0027t happen to you -- and so that the people we elect know they can no longer break the law as they rule by indifference. We deserve much better than this.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorBack in 2014, Dunham\u0027s memoir, Not That Kind of Girl, included a list of things that keep her up at night. Meanwhile, a realistic, yet not overly dramatized depiction of OCD gets a good amount of screen time on Girls in the form of Dunham\u0027s character. But is there such a thing as too revealing?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe Zika virus has been in circulation in Africa for some time, but in the last two years it made a decisive crossing into South America. In any event, in this previously unexposed population it is producing a particularly horrifying havoc.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027For too long, college students have suffered in silence in the face of these attacks, hurt by a culture that encouraged these crimes to be swept under the rug. This is an epidemic and a stain upon our nation -- and it is long past time that Congress took action to address it.Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeThe upcoming election isn\u0027t about detailed policy proposals. It\u0027s about power -- whether those who have it will keep it, or whether average Americans will get some as well.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Some years ago, I faced up to the futility of reporting true things about America\u0027s disastrous wars and so I left Afghanistan for another remote mountainous country far away. It was the polar opposite of Afghanistan: a peaceful, prosperous land.Author, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027When some businesses block tough but truthful criticism, the trustworthiness of such reviews is diminished -- even for businesses that don\u0027t engage in the practice.United States Senator from South DakotaUnited States Senator from South DakotaDear stranger who is so thankful to not to live my life, you seem to think I got coerced into spending my time with small children. I hang out with these little people on purpose. I might not always be a stay-at-home mom, but for now, I chose this.Humor blogger on parenting and life at Wonderoak.comHow would you feel if you realized your children\u0027s water was being poisoned, and your government didn\u0027t seem to care? That\u0027s the story of the parents of 8,000 mostly poor and black children in Flint, Mich., that has finally hit our media front pages.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersTo many, the argument seems compelling; he is, after all, a professed socialist who for most of his career refused to run as a Democrat. But plausible as the electability argument seems, the question remains: is it true?Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyFood insecure children are more likely to be behind in social skills and reading performance in kindergarten. By elementary school they are four times more likely to need mental health counseling.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe problem with \"digital democracy\" can be synthesized down to the willingness by those in power within the Bush and Obama administrations (and later, Google) to embrace the incomplete musings of a naïve young man -- Jared Cohen -- about issues he was ill-positioned to proffer.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Something we can do right now to combat pay inequality in the workplace is talk with our co-workers about our salaries. While Congress works to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to address the multiple barriers to pay equality, knowing our rights could help us now.Representing CA\u0027s 41st District -- Member of the House Veterans\u0027 Affairs Committee \u0026 House Education and Workforce CommitteeDemocratically elected officials were displaced and replaced with emergency management people who cut a deal and sent contaminated river water that corroded pipelines and exposed residents to toxic levels of lead. Gov. Snyder\u0027s administration ignored this problem since 2014, and in terms of direct action, politics and policies, the Flint crisis might just be even worse than Katrina.President, National Action NetworkAccording to an article, these are the things men find unattractive about us women, written by a woman. But if you want me to love my man just the way he is, then he can sure as f*ck love me the way I am.Lover of slayers, hobbits, zombies and time lordsOn behalf of all Muslim Americans, I urge you to rise above your unfounded fears and trust in the truth that implores you to accept us as equal citizens of this nation. Look past our hijabs and long beards and see the love we have in our hearts.Palestinian-American Muslim. Student. Humanitarian.Kenneth Thorpe, an Emory University professor who served in the Clinton administration, claims Sanders\u0027s single-payer plan would break the bank. But his analysis rests on several incorrect, and occasionally outlandish, assumptions.Professor of Public Health at CUNY and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical SchoolProfessor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College; Lecturer in Medicine, Harvard Medical SchoolSo what do I do when I lose the second most important man in my life after my father, who is the most important man and just left? I mourned, and I mourned deeply. But I knew I had to release him, with all my love, and my heart, because my brother was nothing else to me but love. I knew that any sense of sadness and regret would mar the sunshine he was for my life.Wedding photographer, snazzy photoboother, foodie and dog addict www.milouandolin.comI am very concerned when I see presidential candidates fanning the flames of animosity. It is an all too familiar recipe: Strip away individuality and wrap everyone in the group into an amorphous and frightening entity.Holocaust survivor, speaker, writerI wrote a post a year ago about what women over 50 shouldn\u0027t wear. The post was popular and seemed to touch a nerve with a lot of people. In revisiting this theme, it became glaringly obvious that I left some things off the \u0027what not to wear\u0027 list.Drinker of tequila. Blogs at Rubbershoesinhell.comIt seems so unreasonable when you put it that way: My wife left me because sometimes I leave dishes by the sink. But when you choose to love someone, it becomes your pleasure to do things that enhance their lives and bring you closer together, rather than a chore.Writer, single dad, amateur therapist, bad Twitter user. Likes: Funny stuff, books and not divorcing. Blogger at MustBeThisTallToRide.com.I understand that many white men -- and women and people of color as well -- who have been left out of this economy, who can\u0027t make ends meet, who feel that the American dream is not working for them, are very angry about this, and justifiably so. But I cannot countenance the misdirection of their anger.President of the Democracy AllianceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
