{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarA \u0027does it or doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 debate is taking place among female voters in New York as they consider the candidacies of two politicians whose careers were rocked, at least temporarily, by sex-related scandals: Anthony Weiner, a former U.S. congressman now running for New York City mayor, and former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, in the race for city comptroller. The questions: Does it matter when voters know some of the most intimate details of their candidates\u0027 lives? Does it matter if they don\u0027t approve? The issue at stake in these elections isn\u0027t the personal sexual lives of men, but it is personal. And not just for the women who share their most intimate lives with these men. Women voters don\u0027t have to want to marry, or even like, Weiner or Spitzer. But they do have to be able to trust them.Comments (342)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThis week\u0027s battle should be a learning moment for the American people. Who\u0027ll have the courage and honesty to tell them the truth? Who will lead the battle to restore American democracy?Comments (237)Matthew BerrySenior Fantasy Analyst, ESPN(*By any means necessary)CommentsBarry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerThere are a number of television shows that have used the \"ripped from today\u0027s headlines\" concept, but if this trial\u0027s story points were to be adapted into a piece of fiction, it would cause certain problems in credibility in the writers\u0027 room.Comments (453)John Berardi, Ph.D.Founder, Precision Nutrition, www.precisionnutrition.comEggs: They\u0027re just one of those foods. Seems like every other week there\u0027s an egg controversy. Are they good for you, bad for you, or somewhere in between?Comments (231)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Almost everyone knows CEO pay is out of control. What\u0027s less well-known is that you and I and other taxpayers are subsidizing this sky-high executive compensation.Comments (128)Jade SimmonsConcert Pianist, Arts MavenWhat will we do with you? You will be tall and dashing, I can tell, but I fear that on a rainy night dressed in a hoodie this will cause you some issues. So how do I shelter you from a fate sealed by ignorant misunderstanding and prejudiced overreaction?CommentsJenny IsenmanHumor columnist, Jen X\u0027pert, Jenny From the Blog at TheSuburbanJungle.comI\u0027m not gonna sit here and tell you that I was always a punctual person, but becoming a parent has put a whole new spin on my excuses for being late to meetings, lunch dates, parties and appointments.Comments (106)Jack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington PostWhat, precisely, was Rolling Stone supposed to do? Never put anybody bad on its cover? What kind of respect does it show readers to shield them in that way?CommentsEve EnslerTony award winning playwright, performer and activistI am not Trayvon Martin. I will never know what it feels like to live in the skin, in the daily rhythms and predeterminations of a black boy or man in America. But as a woman, there are things I do know and things that I have experienced that bring us into the same story, the same struggle.CommentsArianna HuffingtonThe idea is to make volunteering a first-level option for families when they\u0027re deciding what to do -- right in the mix with movies, going out to eat, playdates, soccer, and Little League. In other words, a normal part of American family life.Comments (106)Mike Hogan and Christopher RosenHey Chris, hear that sound? No, it\u0027s not Saul Berenson reciting the Kaddish, Sally Draper weeping for the loss of her innocence or Tywin Lannister congratulating himself on summarily dispatching his enemies. Rather, it\u0027s the buzz of anticipation surrounding this year\u0027s primetime Emmy nominations.CommentsGlenn CloseEmmy, Golden Globe and Tony Award winning actressMs. Hewes is the mighty litigation lawyer that I had great fun playing over five seasons of Damages. I decided to auction off pieces of her wardrobe in order to raise money for an organization that is very close to my heart -- Bring Change 2 Mind.CommentsAmitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityMost everybody is up in arms over the recent revelations about government snooping and the Obama administration\u0027s investigation of the media to find the leakers. These investigations, the media reports, \"chill\" its sources. Well, I have some questions about this whole ball of wax.Comments (26)Will StephenStaff Writer, College Humor; Contributor to The New YorkerThis is not subversive. This is not anti-establishment. It\u0027s not fun, alt-y, cool, or even solemn. This is thoughtless, irresponsible abuse of your cultural authority, and reckless exploitation of a terrible tragedy.Comments (28)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI quote the following at length because it\u0027s so logical and well said. And remember, he\u0027s saying this stuff in the House of Representatives, where logic has been on an extended vacation.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (19)Sen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkThe military has pledged \"zero tolerance\" for sexual assaults spanning over two decades and they have failed to solve the problem on their own. And while the sexual assault provisions that were passed out of committee last month are a step forward, it was not the leap forward required.CommentsArt BrodskyCommunications consultant, proprietor of Continental Drive blogWhile the e-book world takes a minute to digest the court ruling finding Apple conspired with book publishers to jack up the price of e-books to consumers, it\u0027s worth noting that there is another e-book pricing battle going on.CommentsThomas KentDeputy managing editor and standards editor, Associated PressIs journalism as we know it on its last legs? Some think so. But the evidence is not convincing.CommentsTom GreenComedian, actor and hostIt used to be if you were 16 and pregnant you would get in trouble. Now you get a reality show. You get arrested on TV after a drunken binge and become an instant millionaire.Comments (122)Ken SolinAuthor, \u0027Act Like a Man\u0027We continue typecasting by convincing ourselves that the problem isn\u0027t the type we\u0027re picking, but the people we\u0027re picking, which surely must qualify as an oxymoron. On some level we know we\u0027re automatically eliminating the vast majority of potential dates, but we stubbornly remain on our circular paths anyway.Comments (32)Mark Hyman, MDPracticing physicianHere are easy-to-make or easy-to-buy foods that you can grab and go anywhere with. We all travel out of the house frequently, and with a little bit of planning and shopping, we can stay healthy and keep ourselves out of food emergencies.Comments (18)Sorcha GraceBestselling AuthorYou can pick up all types of what\u0027s been coined \"mommy porn\" along with shampoo and paper towels at your local big box store.CommentsRabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterWomen may biologically be like men in their carnal desire. But historically they have been more mature in linking sex with love. The modern dissociation of the two is troubling, will lead to much heartbreak, and a lot of bad sex.Comments (68)Tom AmmianoAssemblymember for San FranciscoIf the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Oscar Grant, the real-life protagonist of the new film Fruitvale Station, were isolated incidents, we could complain and then feel better. We could protest, and then move on. However, neither death represents a random miscarriage of justice.Comments (11)Christine HasslerLife coach, professional speaker, author and Gen Y expertDuring our 20-something years, there can be a tremendous amount of pressure to figure everything out. We search for answers to important questions like \"What do I want?\" and \"What do I want to do with my life?\"Comments (24)Andrew CollinsLawyer, developer, activistFood stamps are the bottom layer of the social safety net. Even if you think government generally does too much, surely it can step in to prevent the elderly, poor, and sick from going hungry. A society that leaves these people to die is hardly a society at all.Comments (59)Clark ErvinDirector, The Aspen Institute\u0027s Homeland Security ProgramToday, policymakers must reserve time to think about and plan against the security implications of the rise of China and tensions on the Korean Peninsula; the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran; and turmoil all across the Mideast, especially in Syria and Egypt.CommentsPaul AbramsLast person on Earth not on FacebookSo, if a party really wants to win the \u002714 elections so that they can get the unemployment rates down to ~4 percent, they will prove it to voters by agreeing upfront to a shared sacrifice. How does one do that? Simple. Peg congressional salaries to the unemployment rate.Comments (137)Chez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentI sometimes wonder if I\u0027m actually more incensed than KTVU News Director Lee Rosenthal is that his news department somehow allowed four obviously phony, racially insulting Asian pun names to go out over the air last Friday.Comments (18)Chris Weigant, 2013.17.07James Sekhonyane, 2013.17.07Hulu.com, 2013.17.07Nicholas Marlin, 2013.17.07Human Rights First, 2013.17.07Megan Snedden, 2013.17.07Rev.
