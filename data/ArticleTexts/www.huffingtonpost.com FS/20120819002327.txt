{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week started optimistically, with the hope that Paul Ryan\u0027s selection would finally turn campaign 2012 into a big picture discussion about the role of government and the nature of capitalism. Instead, we got outraged reactions to President Obama joking about Seamus the dog, hours of debate over Joe Biden\u0027s use of the word \"chains,\" and a back-and-forth between the campaigns about which presidential candidate was \"unhinged.\" It is 78 days until the election, with 25 million Americans unemployed or underemployed, over 13 million homeowners underwater and our national conversation is still on a level of two children fighting in the back seat of the minivan. Maybe for the first debate, we should strap each candidate into a car seat, give them each a juice box, and let them have at it.Read Post | CommentsMohamed A. El-Erian, 08/15/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOPaul Ryan may be too hasty in dismissing the extent to which the new normal is becoming embedded in our economy and, with each passing week, transitioning from a short-term exception into an even more painful multi-year reality.Read Post | Comments (444)Alec Baldwin, 08/17/12ActorWhen the gas companies are done blasting and pumping and contaminating, after they\u0027ve put the gas on the open market and sold it and the workers head home, who do you think they\u0027ll hand the bill to for the clean up of that mess? Gas companies will make huge profits.

She was who she was and always seemed to be having a great time. She never set out to change the world, educate the masses or become a best-selling author and TV star, but she accomplished all that, anyway -- with grace, humor and, of course, her signature sign-off: \"Bon appétit!\"Read Post | Comments (48)Sen. Bernie Sanders, 08/14/12Independent U.S. Senator from VermontIn these highly volatile economic times, when millions of Americans lost their life savings in the 2008 Wall Street crash, it is important to remember that since its inception, through good economic times and bad, Social Security has paid every penny owed to every eligible beneficiary.Read Post | Comments (499)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 08/13/12Author, research psychologist, and gender expertIt\u0027s no longer true that men cheat far more often than women do.
