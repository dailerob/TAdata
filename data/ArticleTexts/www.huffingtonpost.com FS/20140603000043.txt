What\u0027s sorely missing from the climate change debate is a new economic vision that can quickly transition the US and global economy out of carbon based energy and into renewable energies, while simultaneously increasing productivity and reducing the amount of the earth\u0027s resources used in the economic process, ensuring a more prosperous and sustainable society. That vision is now taking hold.As time wears on, the following prediction will seem less like science fiction and more like science fact: The Republicans will eventually try to take credit for the Affordable Care Act. The fact that it\u0027s proving itself to be increasingly successful, along with the reality that much of the law was originally conceived by Republicans, makes it absolutely ripe for the plucking.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIn the end, this struggle over the meaning of one man\u0027s killing spree may prove to be a watershed moment in the history of feminism, which always has been and still is in a struggle to name and define, to speak and be heard.Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027In the sea of bad news the public receives every day, the Drug War has become one of the leading bright spots, with each day bringing yet another change, the first steps toward rolling back four decades of soul-crushing injustice.Eugene JareckiAward-winning filmmaker, public thinker, and authorYou\u0027ve no doubt heard that this doesn\u0027t happen in countries like Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada where the gun rules are strict and lives are saved.

Now, their strategy is to deny the reality of increasing concentration of income and wealth.Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027What we want from Russia boils down to one word -- respect. And what we hope is that our friends and partners in the West become more cognizant of how easily one might fall into the trap of Kremlin\u0027s narrative -- a narrative that attempts to deny Ukraine\u0027s right for self-determination.Olga BielkovaMember of the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine)The gun industry sits on the horns of a dilemma.
