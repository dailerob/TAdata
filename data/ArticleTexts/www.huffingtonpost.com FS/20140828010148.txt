{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Wherever I go around the world, I see the same hunger to live our lives with more meaning and purpose and less unnecessary stress and burnout. This is the goal of \"33 Days of Awakening Through Loyalty to Your Soul,\" a new online course being offered by the University of Santa Monica, which I\u0027m delighted we have arranged to offer free for HuffPost readers. The class is designed so that on each day of the course, the intention for the day is supported with meditations, videos, podcasts and other resources that help us go deeper. Each day\u0027s email has a theme: clarifying our intentions, accepting what we cannot change, putting our thoughts in writing to help us forgive ourselves and others, writing out a gratitude list, dropping grudges and -- my favorite -- realizing that the way we deal with the issue is the issue. When we make these habits part of our daily practice, we can view ourselves and the world with more awareness and more gratitude.There\u0027s nothing wrong with a group of people standing against torture and abuse -- there\u0027s nothing wrong with lobbying for humane alternatives -- there\u0027s nothing wrong with strongly, perhaps loudly advocating on behalf of the defenseless animals who exist at the receiving end of our collective selfishness and gluttony.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027It\u0027s important to recognize that the qualities men and women share, or don\u0027t, are fluid and ever-changing, and prone to shifting with time, experience, and relationships.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarSaudi Arabia\u0027s internal discord and tensions over ISIS can only be understood by grasping the inherent (and persisting) duality that lies at the core of the Kingdom\u0027s doctrinal makeup and its historical origins.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027These critiques of athletes are not new. They have been articulated for years, in barbershops, bars, social media, various articles and blogs, by the everyday fan to the most celebrated scholars. But many still are misguided and inaccurate.Author, poet, philanthropist, 11-year NBA veteranFor investigative reporting, injustice is the gift that just keeps giving. While so much of the business side of journalism remains in flux, fine reporters with an investigative urge are finding ways to shine much needed light into the parts of our global lives that the powerful would rather keep in the shadows.Director of the International Media, Advocacy and Communications specialization, Columbia University’s School of International AffairsI wasn\u0027t supposed to walk away from the NFL, but I did. I wasn\u0027t supposed to be writing television, but I am. I\u0027m supposed to be lost after football. I\u0027m not. I\u0027ve reinvented myself. This is my first transformation.6-year NFL veteran, screenwriter, creatorEven though you have been a part of my life, you are not my life. I am a smart, strong, independent person and I have the power to control where my life takes me. Maybe I can\u0027t do that completely on my own -- I might need the help of a prescription, or the advice of a therapist, or a good cry session every now and then. But I\u0027m stronger than you.Student, writer, football addict, daughter, friend\"The Hague\" conjures up myriad and often mysterious images for people. Some envision international judges in long robes, presiding over somber criminal trials. Others recall quaint Dutch streets. Many, however, are unsure to what it refers.International lawyer, former Senior Fellow and Interim Attorney-Editor at the American Society of International Law in Washington, D.C.While well intentioned, products like \"Undercover Colors\" actually perpetuate rape culture by placing the burden of safety back onto women.State Policy \u0026 Partnerships Coordinator, Advocates for YouthThe number one reason people give up on good habits, generally, is that they just aren\u0027t enjoyable. It\u0027s a simple truth: You are less likely to continue doing something that you do not enjoy. Here\u0027s some proof...Entrepreneur in tech and behavior change at MaxOgles.comDespite good grades, accomplishments, pleasant manners and common sense, many of our sons are seen as aggressive or prone to violence. When they transgress, as kids will always do, they are judged on a double standard.Blogger at Gays With KidsUntil recently, conventional wisdom had it that nobody could go up against the NRA and win. They had too much money, too much clout, too many politicians doing their bidding and, most of all, a dedicated and energized membership that could swing public opinion and election results their way.Mike the Gun GuyMy dad who died of ALS would be frustrated, as I am, that the Ice Bucket Challenge gives the political adversaries of scientific research a pretext to disguise their views and pretend they haven\u0027t made it harder to find a cure, for any disease at all.Associate Special Projects Editor, The Huffington PostIf Obama does announce immigration changes, Republicans may decide the issue is bigger than any competence issue, and go right ahead and shut the government down. But this doesn\u0027t automatically make the issue a winner for Democrats everywhere in the midterms, of course.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comEarly this morning, The Nation published a leaked recording of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u0027s remarks at a secret meeting of major conservative donors put together by the Koch brothers. At its core, this is a story about why we need to reform the way we finance elections.Executive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American Way \u0026 People For the American Way FoundationWhy, you ask, isn\u0027t anyone talking about the class issue if it figured so heavily into it? Because people are more comfortable talking about things that are beyond their control.Wife, mother, and humor writer at pixiecd.comSen. Mitch McConnell, long known as a champion of big money in politics, has made a stunningly compelling case for a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress and the states to restore sensible limits on political spending. We appreciate his help and his clarity.President, Common CauseIn one of its lesser-known provisions, the Affordable Care Act limited tax breaks for health insurers who benefit from the law. While that may sound arcane, the implications could be profound and far-reaching.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourDone differently, perhaps the for-profit model has the potential to become what its defenders claim it is, but right now it\u0027s the wild West out there, and nothing demonstrates the need for more oversight and regulation in this area than the cash-grab/shitshow that is ASA in New York City.Adjunct Professor/Man-about-TownCertainly our conversations this week should remember the genius of Robin Williams. But we should also be talking about how to help prevent yet another tragedy. The way to help is to start seeing addiction as more than the craving for a substance relief.Richard Taite is founder and CEO of Cliffside Malibu, offering evidence-based, individualized addiction treatment based on the Stages of Change model. He is also coauthor with Constance Scharff of the book Ending Addiction for Good.When the host culture encourages individuality and independence, and your native culture reinforces conformity and tradition, one is left trapped in a ravine between liberty and limitation.Actor, writer and producerSince a number of the discussions I\u0027ve recently had about the events in Ferguson, MO seem to devolve into accusations that I\u0027m either a racist, a liar or an idiot allow me to immediately address some facts that are not in disputeActor, ComedianWhat we need now, what we have always needed, are those in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, Europe, and the United States to stand up, be brave, and find ways for those divided to come together.

This sort of environment is conducive to driving people to high levels of stress.Former Global VP HR Marketing, Communications, Sustainability, Water and Talent, UnileverLabor Day is seen as a day of rest for many hardworking Americans. But for a growing set of U.S. workers, there is no break from trying to earn enough to support their families. Despite a dip in unemployment during the past few years, low pay continues to plague many employees while their corporate bosses rake in record profits.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersIf Plouffe\u0027s move is a canary in a generational cage, it could be that the Millennials will be far harder for our conventional business and political structures to handle than anyone has fully realized.Political Columnist, CEO of Hanft Projects\"Where are the best places to see celebrities tonight?\" That\u0027s the question nobody wants to be caught asking the hotel concierge, because that question is predicated on another question that nobody wants to be asking themselves: Why do I want to see celebrities tonight?Hopper provides insightful, data-driven research to help travelers make better decisions about where to go, and when to fly and buy.\"Cool\" isn\u0027t doing what your friends are doing. \"Cool\" is being confident in where you stand.
