{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"We don\u0027t yet know what big challenge Hillary Clinton will take on next, but that she will bring her considerable talents to something big and worthwhile is not in question. Whether or not that challenge is trying to become the first woman president, she\u0027s in a unique position to help redefine success by using her experience to address the issue of stress in the workplace. Lack of sleep, overwork, and burnout are defining features of America\u0027s business and political culture. Hillary Clinton is in a singular position to change this. As she said in November, \"I would like to see whether I can get untired.\" And maybe I\u0027m dreaming, but the world needs Hillary not only to get herself \"untired,\" but in the next chapter of her life to become a role model for the idea that one can both be untired and successful. If so, there\u0027s no ceiling on what she could accomplish for women -- and yes, for men too.Read Post | Comments (36)Jim Yong Kim, 02/05/13President, World Bank GroupFor many Americans, the higher price of chicken wings was bad news. But the good news that could emerge from food-price sticker shock is that more people will ask what we can do in agriculture to help stop climate change while still feeding the world.Read Post | Comments (82)Marlo Thomas, 02/05/13Award-winning actress, author and activistAs equal parts history buff and feminist, I\u0027ve often wondered about the African-American women who contributed to -- and often led -- our ongoing march to becoming what our Constitution calls \"a more perfect union.\"Read Post | Comments (49)Dean Baker, 02/05/13Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The corporate profit share of national income is near a post-World War II high. The share of income going to the richest 1 percent is almost at its pre-Depression peak. These would seem like impressive accomplishments but the process of upward redistribution, from Joe Sixpack to Joe Six Houses, is a never-ending struggle.Read Post | Comments (407)Bianca Bosker, 02/05/13Executive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostArtificial intelligence has been making a steady creep toward artificial creativity, with algorithms now capable of composing symphonies, writing poems and authoring articles.Read Post | Comments (62)Mary Embree, 02/04/13AuthorOnce, in a psychotherapist\u0027s doctoral dissertation I was editing, I saw the word energize confused with enervate, and they have opposite meanings.Read Post | Comments (1,040)Sally McGraw, 02/04/13Freelance writer, blogger and communications professional; Already Pretty creator and bloggerI cannot deny that thin women seem able to \"get away\" with more than non-thin women, especially when it comes to style choices.Read Post | CommentsAmitai Etzioni, 02/05/13Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityClimate change is expected to be featured during the forthcoming State of the Union. It seems that the speech writers (who \"live\" in a different part of the West Wing from the policy analysts) came up with a theme, but there is rather little that can be done.Read Post | Comments (61)Jonathan Schwarz, 02/05/13Editor, MichaelMoore.comClearly, Powell\u0027s loyalty to George Bush extended to being willing to deceive the world: the United Nations, Americans, and the coalition troops about to be sent to kill and die in Iraq. He\u0027s never been held accountable for his actions, and it\u0027s extremely unlikely he ever will be.Read Post | Comments (150)Claudia Maittlen-Harris, 02/05/13Comedian, writer and producerEver since I was a teenager, I\u0027ve always been resistant to the reasons women change their names to begin with. I understand that it\u0027s tradition. I understand that couples are building a new life and new family together. But there is a part of me that is jealous that men never even have to think about it.Read Post | Comments (386)Hilaria Thomas Baldwin, 02/05/13EXTRA correspondent, fitness and wellness expertThe feud between Democrats and Republicans is one that runs much deeper and more vicious than that of the Red Sox/Yankees. We choose our political label as though it were a sports team and we hold on to it, cemented in our shoes, without blinking.Read Post | Comments (11)Nathan Newman, 02/05/13NYU Information Law Institute FellowWith political leaders talking about general tax reform in D.C., it\u0027s also time to have a serious evaluation of how online content providers can help pay for the next generation of high-speed Internet and finally close the digital divide.Read Post | Comments (53)Vicky Ward, 02/05/13Contributing editor, Vanity FairIn Tampa, Jill Kelley was certainly not known to shy away from the press or the famous. David Petraeus was Tampa\u0027s George Clooney -- and she and her sister were blatant wannabe Stacey Keiblers.Read Post | Comments (90)Andrew Burmon, 02/05/13Travel Editor, The Huffington PostThat they opened the door for future generations of travelers is not up for debate, but the effects of Boomers jamming that door open with a wad of cash is deeply deleterious.Read Post | Comments (48)Ralph Nader, 02/05/13Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorLast week, the State Department reassigned the official responsible for the \"diplomatic issues\" pertaining to the closing of Guantanamo Bay. This was a telling sign that the administration is abandoning its long-held but little-fought-for promise of closing that notorious facility.Read Post | Comments (69)Emma Gray, 02/04/13Associate Editor, HuffPost WomenKerry may have meant his comment with the best of intentions, this seems like the appropriate time to demand a moratorium on all future conflation of the words \"heels\" and/or \"stilettos\" with the words \"female,\" \"woman\" or \"women.\"Read Post | Comments (82)Annabel Park, 02/05/13Director-Producer, storyofamerica.orgI want to direct the same lines said by Joseph Welch in 1954 to Wayne LaPierre, who testified at the Senate committee hearing on January 30, 2013 and shamelessly uses fear-mongering to boost gun sales: Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?Read Post | Comments (255)Laurie David, 02/05/13Producer, author, NRDC TrusteeJust two weeks ago, Coca-Cola made a big show of \"caring\" about our country\u0027s obesity epidemic, releasing an ad that declared, \"We are concerned, we care and we are all in this together.\" The next week, they announce their successful seduction of Taylor Swift, signing her up to promote Diet Coke.Read Post | Comments (84)Rana Florida, 02/05/13CEO, The Creative Class GroupGovernment leaders, Fortune 500 companies, and some of the world\u0027s leading cultural organizations are increasingly turning to Sir Ken Robinson for advice on creativity, education, and the economy.Read Post | CommentsMedea Benjamin, 02/05/13Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceJohn Brennan\u0027s confirmation hearing to become head of the CIA will take place at the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, February 7.

While the bulk of the film involves his escapades with several misfit roommates, I still put the idea aside. Who wants to see a movie with brown people?Read Post | CommentsEric Boehlert, 02/05/13Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIn the wake of the Newtown shooting, LaPierre bemoaned the fact kids aren\u0027t safe at school, in part because it takes police 15 to 20 minutes to respond to a deadly shooting like the one in Connecticut. But that\u0027s not true.Read Post | Comments (220)Marty Kaplan, 02/04/13Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolYou probably already know that America spends more on health care than any other country. That was one of the few facts to survive the political food fight pretending to be a serious national debate about the Affordable Care Act.Read Post | Comments (688)Jared Bernstein, 02/05/13Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorCBO\u0027s out with a new budget and economic analysis today, and as you can imagine we\u0027re all just on shpilkes going through and picking out nuggets. In order to make a lot more sense out of the numbers, we have to adjust them to be on the baseline we believe to be most realistic.Read Post | CommentsAndrew Yang, 02/04/13Founder and President, Venture for AmericaOne way to get more of our most talented young people to embark on the higher-risk, higher-reward path is to create a community and network. It might be a lot easier to take risks if you\u0027re part of a group who will look out for one another.Read Post | CommentsJeff Schweitzer, 02/04/13Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyPeople tend to believe that our species is superior to and separate from the animal kingdom, that we are the end point of the evolution of life on earth. That notion is not only false but extraordinarily dangerous.Read Post | Comments (409)Tom Engelhardt, 02/05/13Editor, TomDispatch.comOne subject, at least, got remarkably little attention during the inaugural blitz and, when mentioned, certainly struck few as odd or worth dwelling on. Yet nothing better caught our changing American world.Read Post | Comments (33)Douglas Anthony Cooper, 02/05/13Novelist, Amnesia (See: Blogger Mortis)One of the year\u0027s more depressing rituals is the annual release of PETA\u0027s kill statistics. The numbers -- just how many pets Ingrid Newkirk\u0027s organization has \"euthanized\" in the past year -- are never anything less than revolting. They are also never a surprise.Read Post | Comments (205)Isabella Huffington, 02/05/13Junior at Yale majoring in Art HistoryMy acne gave me character -- well, that\u0027s not quite true.
