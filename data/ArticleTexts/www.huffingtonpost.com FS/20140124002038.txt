{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFifty years after President Lyndon Johnson declared a War on Poverty, the United States is still not a fair playing field for millions of children afflicted by preventable poverty, hunger, homelessness, sickness, poor education and violence in the world\u0027s richest economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $15.7 trillion. Every fifth child (16.1 million) is poor, and every tenth child (7.1 million) is extremely poor. Children are the poorest age group and the younger they are the poorer they are. Every fourth infant, toddler and preschool child (5 million) is poor; 1 in 8 is extremely poor. A majority of our one- and two-year-olds are already children of color. In five years children of color who are disproportionately poor, nearly 1 in 3, will be a majority of all children in America and of our future workforce, military and consumers. But millions of them are unready for school, poorly educated and unprepared to face the future.CommentsWadah KhanfarJournalist; President, Sharq ForumThe events of the past decades have been a reflection of the interests of the superpowers and the balance of global politics. The past few years have proven that the Middle East\u0027s dependence on international powers is no longer fruitful.CommentsMelissa HillebrennerDirector of Girl Up, United Nations FoundationWhat if you didn\u0027t know when your birthday was? What if your government didn\u0027t know you existed? What if you weren\u0027t counted at all? Counting means a lot of things but mostly \"I count\" means \"I matter.\"CommentsFelix MarquardtFounder, The Atlantic DinnersTo the contrary, following President Francois Hollande\u0027s historic embrace of social democracy in a major policy speech last week, there is reason to believe that the French have finally found their way.CommentsPaul PolmanCEO, UnileverPermissible growth in the future has to be based on sustainable and equitable models. Having acquired a license to operate, it\u0027s time for business to earn a license to lead.Comments (16)Arianna HuffingtonThe launch of The WorldPost comes at a time when the hunger for an expanded global conversation is stronger than ever.Comments (93)Walter IsaacsonPresident and CEO, Aspen InstituteInnovation is wonderful, but on its own it\u0027s not the holy grail. Other things matter just as much in creating a great company or product, most notably execution and focus. Apple excels at these things. That\u0027s why I use an iPhone and iPad. Innovation without execution produces footnotes to history, such as the Xerox Alto and Star.Comments (19)David MacMillanEnergy policyI hope Bill Nye doesn\u0027t underestimate creationists. Between their strident religious confidence and the way they painstakingly dumb-down and oversimplify evidence to fit into 6,000 years, people like Ken Ham can be tough nuts to crack.Comments (81)Laura GottesdienerAuthor, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027Until recently, I knew almost nothing about the Mexican Zapatista movement except that the excessive number of \"a\"s looked vaguely suspicious to me. It\u0027s also why I felt compelled to travel thousands of miles to a Zapatista \"organizing school\" in the heart of the Lacandon jungle in southeastern Mexico to try to sort out just what I\u0027d been missing all these years.CommentsChris KowalAssistant Professor of Consumer Science, Purdue UniversityProcedures were not clear. Classroom doors did not lock. Communication systems were not consistent; students received information sooner in many cases than did the faculty. I believe this lack of preparedness is true across our nation.Comments (32)Jason StanfordDemocratic consultant and writerPearson, the testing company that has gotten rich by making American students fill in little bubbles all day long, is advising the White House on how to whip us all into college-ready shape.CommentsMarty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorReviews throw a spotlight on work we might ignore, and they can embed that work in a context and tradition we might only dimly be aware of. The problem is that reviews also function as commodities.CommentsJonathan HurshExecutive Director and Founder, INCLUDEDWhether we can provide a framework that gives urban migrants outlets for their energy and aspiration is set to become a defining issue of the 21st century.CommentsDevon MurphyAssociate Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaAfter reading Lisa Bloom\u0027s \"How to Talk to Little Girls,\" I put a lot of effort into steering my comments away from children\u0027s looks. But a recent article on Slate called \"How to Talk to a Woman Without Saying \u0027Great Boots\u0027\" was a reminder that it\u0027s not just little girls who need to be told they\u0027re worth more than their big blue eyes and stylish attire.CommentsBrian CzechPresident, Center for the Advancement of the Steady State EconomyLet\u0027s start with a disclaimer: Climate change is one of the biggest threats of the 21st century, and it is an issue that warrants substantial attention. The crux of the matter is how much to prioritize it. Priorities have to be balanced, and the current balance is way out of kilter.CommentsDavid WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Everybody\u0027s Brother\u00277) Recent research proves televisions give off a considerable amount of heat, and for many of you on the East Coast, that will be a good thing because to quote a great song, \"Baby, It\u0027s Cold Outside.\"CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgStep one involves a toothbrush, some dental floss, a little toothpaste and a commitment to use them a couple of times a day. It\u0027s also important to visit a dental professional for preventive care at least once a year. That last part is not so easy or inexpensive for many people.Comments (12)Derek D. Rucker and Tim CalkinsAppearing on the Super Bowl is a big deal. With such high stakes, one would hope that Super Bowl spots would be polished to have a crisp shine of excellence. Unfortunately, not only do spots fail to hit the mark year after year, some spots are so bad that they even damage the brand.CommentsNeill Franklin and Shaleen TitleThe war on drugs, as we all know, has led to mass criminalization and incarceration for people of color. The legalization of marijuana, which took effect for the first time in the country in Colorado on January 1, is one step toward ending that war.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorJoin me tonight for my conversation with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He spent his teens as co-star of the Emmy-winning sitcom, 3rd Rock from the Sun, in a role that put him on the map, and segued into features as a well-regarded adult actor with a wide range of performances.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostCamille\u0027s life is the life shared by a generation of women who are now in their late 60s. They were stay-at-home moms who missed the women\u0027s movement by a few years but rejoiced in the doors that it opened for their daughters. They drove carpools, kept house, had dinner ready on the table when the breadwinner came home, and were the glue that silently kept the family together.CommentsJamie KrugWriter, SAHM, CMO - Chief Medical Officer (of my family), Wife, Blogger at OurStrokeOfLuck.netThey don\u0027t have to imagine how my favorite childhood characters from books walk or talk, what their voices sound like or how they interact with their friends and family -- it\u0027s all right there, laid out in front of them on screens both big and small.CommentsPascal Lamy and Ian GoldinWhile the future is full of opportunity, it is also highly uncertain and characterized by growing systemic risks. In many cases, these risks are the consequences of our success, arising from rising incomes, population growth, interconnectedness and technological advances.CommentsD. R. TuckerFreelance writer and co-host of \"The Green Front\" on Progressive Radio Network (thegreenfront.com)Is climate change too much of a psychological challenge for the president? Is it simply too much for him to confront the near-almighty power of the fossil fuel industry and the Republican (and some Democratic) politicians who are that industry\u0027s acolytes?CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityPsychiatry is a noble and essential calling that should not be judged by the faltering incompetence of the American Psychiatric Association. We need to rectify the mistakes of the past if we are to establish the much needed higher standards for the future.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWith almost half the states allowing marijuana to be used medicinally, and with Obama\u0027s stated opinion that it is \"less dangerous\" than alcohol, the time has come for rescheduling marijuana. Obama should use the his upcoming State of the Union speech to outline this historic change.Comments (32)Jonathan ZittrainProfessor of Law and Computer Science, Harvard University; Founder, Berkman Centre for Internet and SocietyPerceived digital warfare is escalating as a sophisticated breed of attack against corporations, governments and individuals.CommentsRob ReinaldaWriter, 28 years in print journalismThere\u0027s nothing worse than sentences that begin, \"There\u0027s nothing worse than...\" Unless, of course, you\u0027re being ironic to illustrate a point; then it\u0027s acceptable. Quite brilliant, actually.CommentsAmitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityIt is impossible to prove an alternative history, what would have happened had Biden\u0027s Boots Off the Ground strategy been followed. But I found that as far as can be determined, the U.S. -- and many millions of people in the Middle East -- would be much safer and better off if Biden\u0027s counsel was heeded.CommentsJie-Song ZhangProducer and Director of international arts \u0026 cultural exchange projects; Violinist; Contributor, National GeographicI am curious if you have ever found a moment, undressed of your \"Tiger Mom, celebrity author\" costume and all of the salesmanship it entails, to sit in your natural skin as an Asian-American, and as a mother, to properly measure how the thoughts you spread might affect our community, and in particular our youth.Comments (14)Jillian BermanAssociate Business Editor, The Huffington PostEven armed with the knowledge that the conversation was probably going to go my way and the feeling that I did deserve more, I had a tough time getting the words out of my mouth. After the talk ended, I was relieved, but not completely.Comments (49)Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comAs the 2016 election approaches, it is likely that we will also be told that having a clear nominee early in the process, rather than a hard-fought, and potentially nasty, campaign for the nomination will be good for the party. This idea is intuitive and attractive, but it should be noted that it also completely false.Comments (17)Brian Czech, 2014.23.01Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2014.23.01Oyster, 2014.23.01Erin Scot, 2014.23.01Diana Bletter, 2014.23.01Kasim Reed, 2014.23.01Marty Kaplan, 2014.23.01Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2014.23.01Richard Brodsky, 2014.23.01Marnie Nir, 2014.23.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CLAIM: STUDENT HANDCUFFED FOR CUTTING IN LINE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
