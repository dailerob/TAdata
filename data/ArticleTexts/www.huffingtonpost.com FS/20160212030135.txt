{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Policy Analyst for Homeland Security and Civil Liberties, Cato InstitutePresident Obama\u0027s recent speech to the Islamic Society of Baltimore was an attempt to reassure an American minority population feeling very much under siege that they are, in fact, full-fledged Americans -- part of the national fabric, valued, and indeed badly needed in the West\u0027s war on ISIS and like-minded groups. The president acknowledged that \"there have been times where we have fallen short of our ideals,\" adding that \"the best way for us to fight terrorism is to deny these organizations legitimacy and to show that we do not suppress Islam; we celebrate and lift up the success of Muslim Americans.\" Yet Obama\u0027s own administration, and members of Congress, have taken actions in direct contradiction to the president\u0027s claim that \"we have to reject a politics that seeks to manipulate prejudice or bias, and targets people because of religion.\"Black suffering in schools is one manifestation of the anti-Blackness of our society, in which Black people are viewed with disgust and disdain, as non-humans worthy of violence and death. In schools, this anti-Blackness reveals itself first, in the deep-seated, but most often unconscious belief that Black children are uneducable. A problem. A waste of time and unworthy of resources.Assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley.There is more at stake here than the future of one author or one picture book. Most pressing is the question of whether we can ever reach a place in our society where questions of race can be openly and objectively discussed, especially with our children.Award-winning news reporter and cookbook author educated at Columbia University Graduate School of JournalismMy Uber driving is both an adventure and a rough-edged reminder of my vulnerability.Involuntarily retired but crazy busy days grandmothering, in the Uber car, the garden and finding too much to protest for and against.Most of us assume it\u0027s because someone, somewhere sat down with the scientific evidence, and figured out that cannabis is more harmful than other drugs we use all the time -- like alcohol and cigarettes. Not at all.The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsWhat Maureen did recognize, though, was that the pregnant woman on the operating table lay dying and there were few options to save her.Physician and Founder, CEO of Seed Global HealthThe night I killed my dad, I became addicted to heroin. I loved the SOB and I just watched him die. Why did I do it? Well, it\u0027s complicated.Author of \"What\u0027s Left of Us: A Memoir of Addiction\"I love Scrabble and play it daily as a release from politics and law. As the race for Barack Obama\u0027s successor heats up, herewith three lessons from Scrabble for politics: knowledge, vision, and flexibility.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusInstead of the wishful thinking of Secretary Kerry, who seems unable to talk about Egypt without referring to an illusory \"transition to democracy,\" Sewall noted the economic, security, and political challenges facing Egypt in her Cairo visit.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstBernie Sanders\u0027 \"honesty\" comes from a new system of truth. Hillary Clinton\u0027s \"honesty\" comes from the old. It\u0027s up to each of us to choose which system we want this election to give us. We have a choice.Social systems scientist/World Peace advocateThe gravitational disturbance that produced this history-making detection was apparently the result of two colliding black holes. That\u0027s not something you see every day. Yes, gravity waves are ubiquitous, but even the extremely sensitive instrumentation of LIGO is thoroughly unable to pick up these very local disturbances. It took a rare cosmic catastrophe to produce a space-time ripple large enough to be sensed.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial asks \"What is beauty?\" On view is a highly-curated exhibition of Instagram-ready objects that attempt to answer that question.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnImagine parents endlessly praising their son as \"the smartest, handsomest, most athletically gifted boy since God created Adam.\" We\u0027d conclude that they were thoroughly obnoxious, if not a bit unhinged. Yet the military remains just this sort of favored son, the country\u0027s golden child. And to the golden child go the spoils.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceI submit we need to go back to basics and unify around a proven, tested message that works. Then repeat it every time we open our mouths for the next few years. Put it in our every communication. Till we are sick to death of it, and then some. Hey, it works for Donald and Bernie.Chairman and founder, FentonThe reality is that King himself supported democratic socialism -- and that civil rights activists and socialists have walked arm-in-arm for more than a century. The same news outlets that omit such facts keep telling us that the mass of African-American voters in South Carolina and elsewhere are diehard devotees of Hillary (and Bill) Clinton.Author and media criticLast week I wrote a swooning review of Zahav restaurant in Philly\u0027s Society Hill neighborhood, the brilliant invention of Michael Solomonov, one of the most creative chefs of his generation. Eating at Zahav was supposed to be just one of many stops on a tour of Jewish sites of the city. Philadelphia has a rich Jewish history, dating back to Colonial times, and I\u0027d hoped to explore more of it.Creative Director and CEO, Fig Tree \u0026 VineThis is about whether the Democratic Party is going to care about inequality for the next decade. We are making a historical decision between two distinct ideological paradigms, not a choice between flavors of popcorn. This is important. Choose carefully.PhD student at the University of CambridgeThere are so many levels to Formation that those of us who felt it, really feel it. There really isn\u0027t (that) much to joke about. Or waste time hating on.Director of Digital Media at GoodsperoAhn Cheol-soo has referred to himself as a \"Bernie Sanders of Korea\" but has taken the distinctly different approach of leaving the Korean Democratic Party behind and setting out with both conservatives and liberals to chart a new course.Director, The Asia InstituteAs Europe and America are once again rattled with fear that disenfranchised immigrants and war-ravaged refugees will turn into radical jihadists, and two-thirds of Republican voters in New Hampshire say they support a ban on Muslims entering the country, let\u0027s not make the same mistake of tarnishing an entire group for the beliefs of the few.Author, “The Italian Americans: A History\"It is still very early, and there will be twists and turns aplenty, but the election results so far have convinced me of one thing: Whoever wins the 2016 presidential election, we are going to see sweeping change in this country over the next several years.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersWhile Washington seems to piddle with the plights of the privileged, African Americans remain at the top of the class for almost every major disease and bad habit that leads to them. Smoking-related illness? Yes. HIV? Number one. Diabetes? Absolutely.Director of Communications for NAATPN, a national nonprofit dedicated to realizing health equity for African AmericansIf passed, the TPP would lock in policies that not only allow price gouging, but essentially require all TPP-signatory governments to provide monopoly rights allowing drug companies to charge whatever they want.Director, Public Citizen\u0027s Global Trade WatchKnowing how to talk to someone with cancer can be terrifying and made even harder when you know and are close to that person.Blogger, mamamim.comAmericans experience an average of 935,000 heart attacks and 383,000 people suffer from cardiac arrest -- when the heart stops pumping entirely. Both heart attacks and cardiac arrests carry with them the serious risk of death and disability. In fact, the survival rate for sudden cardiac arrest in this country is less than five percent.Trustee at the Helmsley Charitable TrustWhat does Carlsen have in common with sport superstars Lionel Messi, Jaromir Jagr or Stephen Curry? They all seem unstoppable. Everybody knows they are going to score, but not many are able to prevent it.International Chess GrandmasterSuccess in Iowa and New Hampshire translates into more publicity and more money. But it shouldn\u0027t. The primary system that was originally intended to make elections more democratic has made them far less so.Former FCC Chairman, Senior Counsel Sidley AustinThe Independent has stepped outside the remit of journalism and waddled into a display of misguided political bravado where none is called for. India will survive, thank you very much, without a British paper owned by a Russian oligarch taking up the cudgels on its behalf.Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost IndiaWe want Bernie, because he is not fueled by an egotist\u0027s dream of presidency. He is real. He is fueled by the issues of people who need help. Bernie is not running for the presidency. He is running for the people who are not getting the voice they deserve.High School Student.Fan of classic rock, skiing, and politics.With everyone pulling an ERMAHGERD MERRERGE, I became Chandler Bing. Graeme wanted to move in together and I was like NOPE. He wanted to get joint banking accounts and I was like NOPE. But if it hadn\u0027t been for all the continuous external marriage talk, I doubt I would have been as hardcore about the NOPE\u0027s.Lover of slayers, hobbits, zombies and time lords (www.ladydickson.com)Before passing judgement on an addict please imagine what it must be like to be one. To suffer from the most demoralizing, misunderstood, stigmatized disease.Registered nurseGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
