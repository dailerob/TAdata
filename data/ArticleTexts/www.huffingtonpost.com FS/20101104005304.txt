{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"In the end, the 2010 midterms came down to a very simple truth: if unemployment were near double digits come November, Democrats would take a beating. It is, and they have. Exit polls found that nearly nine in ten voters believe the economy is in bad shape. The same percentage said they feel pessimistic about America\u0027s economic future. That\u0027s practically everyone! And while a large majority of voters still believe that George Bush is to blame for getting us into this mess, they are clearly holding Obama accountable for not fixing it. The Pottery Barn rule -- \"you break it, you own it\" -- was given a twist tonight. Turns out, sometimes even if you weren\u0027t the one who broke it, you own it. So it is with our broken economy. Bush broke it, but Obama, underestimating just how broken it is, owns it.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 11.03.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowWe typically like the idea of two sides locking horns and compromising on the matters of the day. But the era when Republicans would compromise with a Democratic president is long gone. Welcome, everyone, to the suck that never ends.Read Post | CommentsJacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson, 11.03.2010Authors, Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer—And Turned Its Back on the Middle ClassThe 2010 election was the political equivalent of the perfect crime: The GOP vigorously challenged all measures to fix the economy and was then rewarded for it at the polls by transferring the blame.Read Post | CommentsJacob Heilbrunn, 11.03.2010Author, \"They Knew They Were Right: the Rise of the Neocons\"President Obama didn\u0027t come out swinging at his press conference. He didn\u0027t come out cowering, either. If he\u0027s going to rescue his presidency, he will need to start acting presidential instead of like a passive observer of it.Read Post | CommentsJane Hamsher, 11.03.2010Founder, FireDogLake.comDemocrats in Congress were prepared to absorb defeats last night.

When you look at the measures, you see an overwhelming rejection of conservative doctrine.Read Post | CommentsArt Brodsky, 11.03.2010Communications Director, Public KnowledgeAfter the shouting has died down and after the House elects its Republican leaders, the reality is that policy in the telecom sector will likely remain where it has been for the past two years -- in state of suspended animation.Read Post | CommentsBilly Kimball, 11.03.2010Editor-in-Chief, The Old YorkerI know that stimulating the economy wasn\u0027t your primary goal and that you spent this money to further your own self-interest. But that doesn\u0027t mean that the collateral benefits should be ignored.Read Post | CommentsHuffington Post, 11.03.2010After a historic 2010 election night, the results are in.

They should compromise when they must, but this time they need to make it clear that they are compromising.Read Post | CommentsNorm Stamper, 11.03.201034-year veteran police officer who retired as Seattle\u0027s chief of police in 2000For several months California\u0027s Proposition 19 appeared headed for victory.
