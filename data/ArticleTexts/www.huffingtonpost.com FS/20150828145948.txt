{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Navy veteran and Co-Director of the Truman National Security Project San Diego ChapterThere have been more than 800 mass shootings since Sandy Hook, and politicians still don\u0027t care beyond the minimum expected lip service immediately following an incident. Have we seen any reforms to prevent weapons and ammunition from making their way into the hands of the mentally ill? No. Have we seen any progress on creating national standards for background checks on gun buyers? No way. Have we seen any efforts to restrict the most dangerous weapons, the highest capacity magazines, or the most damaging ammunition? Not a chance. The failure to implement even the most general or common sense reforms is an absolute refusal to lead on the part of Congress. It\u0027s a flat-out disregard for the safety of American citizens. It\u0027s shameful political cowardice.Emphasizing that you are campaigning with the people, not on stage before the people, is what helps build the movement that will continue after the election -- win or lose.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorMost agree that the work to reinvent New Orleans remains unfinished. That\u0027s true, especially because post-Katrina New Orleans is trending back toward its old self -- a sluggish regional economy with high inequality and not enough opportunities for its residents. That was certainly not the vision.Co-Director and Senior Fellow, Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings InstituteApparently we\u0027re going to hear much more about \"illegals\" from the GOP campaign, and among their rote talking points will be how harmful such immigrant are for the U.S. economy and workers. Standing against such nonsense is not only the humane thing to do, however, but the factual thing to say as well.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesWhen Ted Cruz dismissed Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly\u0027s questions to him on immigration as something a \"liberal journalist\" would ask, the right-wing Media Research Center applauded it. After all, that evasion tactic is straight from the MRC playbook.Founder and Editor, ConWebWatch.com; former senior editor, Media MattersDavis is going down as a martyr to cause, having galvanized bigots and religious extremists across Kentucky and across the country, claiming that their religious freedom has been infringed upon by the Supreme Court\u0027s ruling.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostAs with any crisis, we can expect media coverage to extend across our televisions, computers, and mobile devices. The worry evoked is therefore exponential, and as parents and educators, we must consider the impact on the most impressionable and vulnerable among us--our kids.Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Executive Director, the Clay Center for Young Healty Minds, Massachusetts General Hospital, clinician, educator and musicianFashion Week: for a young woman recovering from anorexia, attending fashion week, surrounded by beautiful people, skinny models, and a society which is centered around appearances, is similar to sending a recovering alcoholic to a bar that serves free drinks all night. Basically, a huge trigger.ViolinistThis country is crying out for solutions to our myriad problems but our culture often rewards meanness, division and incivility. The emphasis on the latter makes the former all that much more difficult to achieve.Former Congressman and Secretary of AgricultureThe live aspect of our business is just one of the many reasons that television news is not for the faint of heart. Nor is it for the thin-skinned. And in the hours after we found out that Adam and Alison\u0027s killer was someone who had been a journalist, I had one thought -- he wasn\u0027t one of us.JournalistIs there any grassroots groundswell calling on Biden to run? I sure can\u0027t hear it. It seems like the biggest fans of a potential Biden run are political journalists looking to cover a more exciting horse race, and some Democratic insiders who look at the same polls I cited and want an establishment insider -- any insider -- to be the alternative to Hillary, rather than Sanders.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistAll kinds of women exist. If you\u0027re looking for a true soul partner, marry a woman who adopts a pIt bull. Marry a woman who adopts a pit bull and walk through the world fearlessly. Not because their is a fierce beast at the end of the leash. But because of the fierce woman at your side.Native New Yorker, Indonesian and world music aficionado, dog, especially rescued Pit Bull, lover. Grammar nerdWhile clicktivism (sometimes called slacktivism) has had its share of critics, the case of Amir Hekmati demonstrates that it can be an effective tool in implementing change.Campaign coordinator, Free Amir campaignAre you aware that your breasts can get off from a great roll in the hay? Or that having a good-looking partner may lead to a grander finale? (True and true.) We uncovered scientific findings that might just make your next bedroom session even better.Health.com motivates you to eat smart, stay fit, be happy, and live your best life.One day, you realize how absurd your current mindset is, that this shit doesn\u0027t matter. You let your demons go, knowing that, perhaps, sharing your story can help some other chubby, goofy, socially-isolated, sensitive kid getting bulled in America who feels like no one in the world cares about him.Former NFL playerWe are the only species known to deny overwhelming evidence -- about the dangers of smoking -- in ways that actually put us in greater danger. The emotional nature of human risk perception can sometimes produce a literally self-destructive irrationality. Non-human animals don\u0027t make such mistakes.Author, \u0027How Risky Is It, Really?\u0027What you may not know about owning a pit bull is just how much you\u0027ll grow to love these blocky-headed dogs. Owning a pit bull may be habit-forming. You just might own two, or maybe three, or if you\u0027re really lucky, you just might own four. Good things come in multiples sometimes.Photographer, writer, outdoor enthusiast, and devoted canine mom to four rescued pit bulls/pit mixes.Unfortunately, anxiety disorders are often misunderstood and it can be difficult to know what to say to someone who is suffering. The following are four things that you should never say to someone who is struggling with an anxiety disorder.Mental Health Therapist, Social Worker, Body Image Activist and Wellness EnthusiastDespite the tremendous losses suffered during those terrifying days and nights in August ten years ago, we pause to remember those who were lost... celebrate those who survived... and praise those who call New Orleans home.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorGeorge W. Bush, not Bernie Sanders, is the real \"socialist\" of our generation, primarily because the economy collapsed under his tenure and as a result, the conservative president began an ongoing program of government stimulus into various industries.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comLet\u0027s pretend for a minute that Trump is a serious candidate who really believes the views he espouses on the campaign trail. His xenophobic, racist, unrealistic statements on immigration are getting all the attention, but I think another of his go-to themes is also acting as a major draw for supporters: His argument that he is not beholden to donors.Writer and ProfessorDaesh (\"ISIS\") recently destroyed an ancient monastery and a church. This, after abducting several Christians, in what has become the group\u0027s long scourge on humanity. Contrary to ISIS\u0027s ignorance and propaganda, Prophet Muhammad sought to protect the rights of Christians.Visiting Fellow, Harvard University\u0027s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal School of Islamic StudiesThe littlest issues caused me great stress. I felt as though I were running a marathon every day when in reality, I rarely ran at all. The daily marathon of life became harder to sustain as I became more depleted.A wellness website dedicated to mindful livingYes, I know, and I agree: Motherhood is precious. Babies are miracles. Time goes too fast. The days are long, but the years are short. But here\u0027s what people don\u0027t get: I can enjoy my baby and still wish he would sleep.Blogger at Raves \u0026 Revelations, writer, digital content guru, marketer, social media maven, wife and momSanders is unwilling to break with the U.S.-Saudi alliance that has done such damage to both the Arab people and the American people. Now, we have a full-fledged, Israeli-Saudi alliance, and it must be music to the ears of pro-Israeli journalists for Sanders to be calling for U.S. backing of further Saudi domination.Communications director, Institute for Public AccuracyElders ask questions and learn how to build intergenerational movements, even when they do not understand younger generations. Elders build. Old people? They die. They judge and die. I submit that they kill young people in the process.Law student, Writer, and Quan Hitter. #Ferguson Freedom Fighter.For several years now, the most innovative programming on television has come from cable programmers, not broadcasters. Understanding that, Sesame Workshop has made a bold and creative move.Former FCC Chairman, Senior Counsel Sidley AustinThere is no such thing as presumption of innocence if you are a poor, black Brazilian who wants to go to the beach in a part of the city \"where you are not supposed to be.\"Senior News Reporter at Brasil PostIf our legislators and Governor really support fair pay for women, as 90 percent of the voters think they should, supporting Senate Bill 3 is the right thing to do.Executive Director of Equal Rights AdvocatesDogs, like people are individuals and should be treated and evaluated as individuals, not by the blanket categories of breed or appearance. Too many dogs have senselessly lost their lives simply for being born with a big head and a muscular looking body, but the tide has turned.Co-founder, Best Friends Animal Society; animal welfare activistFor years, Republicans have used race bait politics to consolidate their support among white, working class voters. For years, they postured about military action for partisan advantage. For years, they have worshipped Reagan as a man on a horse who rode in to save the country.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
