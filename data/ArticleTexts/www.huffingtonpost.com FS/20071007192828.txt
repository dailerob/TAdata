{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPAPSee all posts »BIOThis week, Mark Penn, Hillary Clinton\u0027s top strategist, desperately tried to spin away the reasons Burson-Marsteller, the PR giant he oversees, had taken on Blackwater as a client. It was only a temporary assignment; it was the work of a GOP-friendly subsidiary; Penn \"did no work on the Blackwater account,\" said Team Hillary. But why hasn\u0027t Penn been forced to choose between advising Hillary and overseeing a client list that has included Philip Morris, Merck, and Ahmad Chalabi? When George Bush ran in 2000, he insisted Karl Rove sell a political consulting firm Rove had founded. Questions to the Clinton campaign: How much was Burson-Marsteller paid by Blackwater? As CEO of the company, Penn will share in the Blackwater revenue, right? Who, exactly, worked on the account and what, exactly, did they do?
