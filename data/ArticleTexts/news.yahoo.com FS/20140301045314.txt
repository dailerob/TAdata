By his own benchmark for performance, Buffett\u0027s Berkshire Hathaway Inc almost certainly lagged a red-hot stock market in 2013 and probably also fell short over the previous five years, his favored timeframe for measuring the firm\u0027s return for its investors. Using the gain in Berkshire\u0027s book value per share after taxes, which Buffett traditionally contrasts with the pre-tax total return, including dividends, on the Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s 500 Index, Berkshire will be hard pressed to match the S\u0026P\u0027s 128.2 percent gain in the five years ended December 31, 2013. The whopping 32 percent total return on the S\u0026P last year only makes it more likely that Berkshire\u0027s book value did not match the index\u0027s five-year performance.How Fraudsters Are Using a Clever Scheme to Appear as Real Tech SupportJust when you thought you knew everything there is to know about the island of Alcatraz, a group of scientists comes along and discovers tunnels buried under the former prison\u0027s walls that experts had thought were destroyed long ago.Paging Sherlock Holmes.

Appearing in southern Russia where he has taken refuge since fleeing Ukraine on February 21, Yanukovich said: \"I think that Russia should act and is obliged to act. \"Knowing Vladimir Putin\u0027s personality, I am surprised that he is still saying nothing. Russia cannot be indifferent, cannot be a bystander watching the fate of as close a partner as Ukraine,\" the 63-year-old Yanukovich said.What, no tip jar?

The debate, between Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser, underscored a fundamental disagreement over the central bank\u0027s optimal approach to policy under new Fed Chair Janet Yellen. To Evans, one of the Fed\u0027s most dovish policymakers, allowing inflation to run above the Fed\u0027s 2-percent target would be a small price to pay for bringing the U.S. economy back to full employment quickly, and could even signal the Fed\u0027s commitment to making good on its goals. To Plosser, an ardent policy hawk, letting inflation rise above the target would call into question the Fed\u0027s commitment to its goals, undermining its policy effectiveness.Their act hasn\u0027t changed that much over the past several thousand years, but the northern lights still put on a dazzling show whenever they take the stage.Ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych says he was forced from power by \"gangsters.\"WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.
