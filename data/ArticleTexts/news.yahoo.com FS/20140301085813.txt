By his own benchmark for performance, Buffett\u0027s Berkshire Hathaway Inc almost certainly lagged a red-hot stock market in 2013 and probably also fell short over the previous five years, his favored timeframe for measuring the firm\u0027s return for its investors. Using the gain in Berkshire\u0027s book value per share after taxes, which Buffett traditionally contrasts with the pre-tax total return, including dividends, on the Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s 500 Index, Berkshire will be hard pressed to match the S\u0026P\u0027s 128.2 percent gain in the five years ended December 31, 2013. The whopping 32 percent total return on the S\u0026P last year only makes it more likely that Berkshire\u0027s book value did not match the index\u0027s five-year performance.Just when you thought you knew everything there is to know about the island of Alcatraz, a group of scientists comes along and discovers tunnels buried under the former prison\u0027s walls that experts had thought were destroyed long ago.Paging Sherlock Holmes.
