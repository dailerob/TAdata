Newsman Dan Rather is set to relinquish his anchor and managing editor duties at CBS EVENING NEWS. ADDRESSES CBS NEWSROOM AT APPROXIMATELY 1:39PM EST [Partial transcript -- joined in progress]: No matter what you hear elsewhere, this was a mutual decision. The timing has to do with (wanting to separate) this decision to leave the anchor chair... from the (investigation) of the 60 MINUTES report. The decision got made the way I described. There is nothing more important (to me) than how honored I am to work with the greatest news organization in the world. Thank you for coming. We\u0027re not going to spend much time (on questions) because we have news to cover. (Offered to answer questions, but staff simply gave his signature \u0027hip hip\u0027 three cheers.) Let\u0027s get back to work. Thanks everyone. REPORT: SEPT 11-TYPE ATTACK THWARTED IN UK... Nearly Half of Adults with HIV Are Women... Spreading like wildfire among young in former Soviet states...
