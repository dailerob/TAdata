The University of Iowa owns the $140 million painting, considered one of the key art works of the 20th Century.Jackson Pollock added his signature in bold strokes on the canvas of \u0027Mural.\u0027Conservators at the Getty Conservation Institute and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles studied archival photographs to better understand how the pigments and materials of Jackson Pollock\u0027s \u0027Mural\u0027 have changed since the work was created 70 years ago.Reference books are ever ready as art scholars and conservationists study Jackson Pollock\u0027s \u0027Mural.\u0027Volunteer artist Kristi Parenti-Kurttila conducted painting experiments to demonstrate that oil paints could be used to create Pollock\u0027s distinctive splatter effect while the canvas is vertical. Her efforts helped convince scholars that \u0027Mural\u0027 was painted while the canvas was upright.Materials scientist Alan Phenix pointed out an area where Pollock used a water-based house paint to repaint the white canvas background of \u0027Mural.\u0027Mr. Phenix examined one in a series of hyperspectral scans that isolates various colors and pigments used by Pollock in \u0027Mural\u0027 based on their infrared signature.To remove a tiny paint sample for analysis, conservators studying \u0027Mural\u0027 use a razor-edged knife and then catch the chip in a folded Post-It note.Mr. Phenix demonstrated how the conservators only sampled the painting at spots where the canvas was already damaged. The paint chips taken for analysis were, on average, about a half-millimeter across.A cross-section of Pollock\u0027s paint from \u0027Mural\u0027 is magnified on the computer screen to better show the layers of white ground coating, paint and varnish.A downward drip of white water-based house paint, at center, is evidence that Pollock applied the paint while the canvas of \u0027Mural\u0027 was in an upright position. Mr. Phenix pointed to an area where the paint has chipped.Mr. Phenix pointed to an area where analysis of paint chips show that Pollock used low-grade, water-based \u0027retail trade paint\u0027 to lighten the background spaces between the swirls of colored linear shapes.On his computer, Mr. Phenix studied a micro-photograph of the layered composition of a paint chip taken from \u0027Mural.\u0027Pollock dated the 8-by-20-foot painting with the year that he signed a gallery contract with art patron Peggy Guggenheim, who commissioned the painting.Making an art of material science, researchers at the Getty Conservation Institute have labored for a year to repair one of the 20th century\u0027s most important American paintings: a Jackson Pollock creation called Mural.Subscriber Content Read PreviewSome Republicans already are showing up in Iowa, jockeying over what is expected to be a wide-open 2016 presidential race, barely nine months after the latest one concluded.Subscriber Content Read PreviewThe dollar is stumbling as investors begin to question the relative strength of the U.S. economic recovery, which had powered a rally in the greenback in the first half of 2013.Subscriber Content Read PreviewMedtronic acquired Cardiocom LLC, a disease-management and patient-monitoring firm, an expanding business in light of the new health-care laws.Subscriber Content Read PreviewJapan posted weaker-than-expected annualized 2.6% growth in the three months through June, clouding prospects over whether the government will go ahead with a planned increase in the sales tax that is needed to cut the country\u0027s massive public debt.Subscriber Content Read PreviewAuthorities allege a U.S. couple made more than $1 million in a \"massive, serial insider-trading scheme\" that involved a network of nine friends and relatives who exploited inside information from a banker.Money managers trying to gauge the stock market\u0027s direction have started looking to the buyout business for signals, and they don\u0027t like what they are seeing.Subscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewThe ruling to ban the import of some Samsung products into the U.S. will sap momentum for the South Korean behemoth just as it has overtaken Apple as the U.S.\u0027s biggest smartphone maker.Subscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewThe 36-year-old Cleveland hit nine of 14 fairways and left himself with makeable birdie putts to stay ahead of Furyk, Stenson and Scott.Senior Republicans expressed concern about President Obama\u0027s proposal to add a privacy advocate at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.Subscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewVoters in Mali headed to the ballot boxes Sunday for a presidential runoff, in another step toward re-establishing democracy and rule of law in the West African country.Subscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewIncome-hungry investors have flocked to energy-focused master limited partnerships and MLP funds this year.
