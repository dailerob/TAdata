India\u0027s slow response to years of medical warnings now threatens to turn the country into an incubator for a mutant strain of tuberculosis that is proving resistant to all known treatments, raising alarms of a new global health hazard.Dr. Udwadia talked to two patients who are brother and sister and both have tuberculosis. Dr. Udwadia, one of India\u0027s leading TB authorities, told the young man that his test results show that he can be treated with common medicines for tuberculosis.Spread of the strain that is resistant to all known treatments could return tuberculosis to the fatal plague that killed two-thirds of people afflicted before modern treatments were developed in the 1940s, said Mario Raviglione, director of the Stop TB Department of the World Health Organization. Shown, Dr. Udwadia checked X-rays.Dr. Udwadia visited Sharda Bhosle, who has tuberculosis for the second time. The first time, she received treatment at a government hospital. When she got the disease for a second time, she went to a private hospital, even though she would have to pay for the medicine herself.Dr. Udwadia wrote prescriptions inside his office. India has the largest number of the world\u0027s cases—2.3 million of the nearly nine million people afflicted annually—and it is the country\u0027s most fatal infectious illness.The number of known cases of the strain that is resistant to all known treatments in India is small but geographically dispersed. Shown, Dr. Udwadia with Ms. Bhosle and her daughter-in-law.Many of the people in the waiting room of the third floor of Hinduja Hospital come to be treated for tuberculosis and lung problems.Tuberculosis, a communicable, airborne disease that usually attacks the lungs, is mostly found in pockets of deep poverty around the world. Healthy, well-fed people are less likely to contract the disease when exposed. Shown, people in the hospital waiting room.Dr. Udwadia tested Suman Kemkar, who has tuberculosis; he is waiting to determine if her strain is drug-resistant.A patient showed a handful of medicine she was told to take. Government authorities estimated about 100,000 of India\u0027s patients have drug-resistant strains, which researchers say can mutate into forms increasingly immune to more and more medicines.Ganga Jatolia, shown here with her mother Geeta, lived with her parents, brother Dinesh, and other relatives in a tiny house in the Chembur neighborhood in Mumbai. Ganga died of the disease earlier this month.On a shelf in the home is a photograph of Ganga\u0027s older brother, who died this year of TB. Last year, an older sister died of the disease.Ganga\u0027s brother Dinesh, shown here, also has tuberculosis, and his is an extensively drug-resistant strain. He is receiving treatment from Dr. Udwadia that seems to be working.Ganga\u0027s parents assemble chappals, Indian slippers, for less than one cent a pair. The family income is $60 a month. The mother, Geeta Jatolia, sold her gold jewelry to buy $6,000 worth of TB medicines for the first two children who died because the Indian government only paid to treat patients with the regular strain.India\u0027s slow response to years of medical warnings now threatens to turn the country into an incubator for a mutant strain of tuberculosis that is proving resistant to all known treatments.Microsoft\u0027s first-ever homegrown computer has created confusing new battle lines in the tech sector, turning longtime allies into rivals and underscoring a philosophical split over the purpose and future of tablet-style devices.World leaders papered over their differences after clashing over the euro-zone debt turmoil, deferring concrete decisions to other meetings despite warnings of another global crisis.Subscriber Content Read PreviewBrady Dougan, long lauded for safely steering Credit Suisse Group through the financial crisis, finds himself under mounting pressure over the bank\u0027s recent performance.Subscriber Content Read PreviewA CFTC subcommittee is expected to propose a roughly 60-word definition of high-frequency trading that would define it broadly, a bad sign for traders who had hoped for narrower language.Subscriber Content Read PreviewFederal Reserve policy makers, meeting amid growing concerns about the U.S. recovery and the European debt crisis, have an array of options if they decide the economy needs an added boost.Subscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewMinute-by-minute analysis of Game 4, as LeBron James and Miami play at home for a 3-1 series lead over Kevin Durant and Oklahoma City.
