Here, Lea Hong, Hawaii director for the Trust for Public Land, looked out at part of the estate. The nonprofit Trust for Public Land is brokering the deal.The 1750-acre estate dates back to George Galbraith, a cattle rancher from Ireland who left his country in the mid-1800s to follow the California Gold Rush, but stopped first in Hawaii and never left, according to historical accounts. The estate is now shared by more than 600 heirs.Stickers adorned a for-sale sign advertising land from the Galbraith Estate in September. The property straddles a fertile plain about 20 miles from downtown Honolulu, and developers had for years sought to buy it to further extend the capital\u0027s suburbs.Ms. Hong, of the Trust for Public Land, left, stood with Peter Yuh, conservation branch chief for the U.S. Army Garrison-Hawaii. The U.S. Army approved the plan for farmland, as the land would be a buffer between development and its nearby Schofield Barracks.Tourists wandered around the Kukaniloko Birthing Stones, one of Oahu\u0027s most important Hawaiian cultural sites. The stones are on land almost completely surrounded by the Galbraith property and accessible on a public trail.Shown, the Kukaniloko Birthing Stones.Former agriculture buildings and structures located on neighboring land in Whitmore Village may be restored under a similar conservation deal. Moves to preserve farmland near Hawaii\u0027s cities are rare, given the land\u0027s development value.Many of the old farm buildings in Whitmore Village may be restored and used by the new agriculture projects.Shown, a view of the Galbraith Estate.The trustee for hundreds of heirs to a large land tract in Hawaii has agreed to sell their inheritance to the state for preservation as farmland, reversing a decadeslong trend of most land being developed.Subscriber Content Read PreviewSubscriber Content Read PreviewDish Chairman Charlie Ergen said his bet to enter the wireless industry is looking \"increasingly risky,\" highlighting the hurdles the satellite operator faces in light of restrictive conditions that may be set by regulators and a failed effort to buy a cellular carrier over the summer.Subscriber Content Read PreviewThe tech-heavy Nasdaq has slid for six weeks, its longest losing streak since 2008.
