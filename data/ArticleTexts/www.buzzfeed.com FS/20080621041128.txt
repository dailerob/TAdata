{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Sports Buzz A baseball pitcher who can throw right-handed or left-handed! He has a special 6 finger, double webbed glove so it works on both hands. He recently faced a switch hitter leading to mass confusion.Style Buzz The designer’s $148 dress is suddenly selling like hotcakes thanks to Michelle Obama. After the potential next First Lady wore the frock during her appearance on The View, the dress sold out online.Movie Buzz It’s like ‘jump the shark,’ only for movies. The scene in the new Indiana Jones film in which Indy survives a nuclear blast by crawling into a lead-lined fridge is so ridiculous it’s spawned a new phrase for describing when a series of movies has stretched our disbelief past the breaking point. For example, the Star Wars series nuked the fridge with the introduction of Jar Jar Binks.A woman who refused to sell her home to developers for $1 million, and then lived there while they built around her, has died at age 86.Tech Buzz With gas prices so high, the low-tech push reel mower is making a comeback. I don’t care that much about the gas savings, I just think push reel mowers are classy. Or you could go with the solar-powered robot mower, if you trust robots (note: you shouldn’t trust robots).Tech Buzz A compact wi-fi device that displays useful and entertaining information from the web and acts like an internet-enabled alarm clock. It comes with a little octopus charm! It’s definitely not something you need, but just think about how you can marvel at its cuteness every morning when you wake up.Business Buzz With a string of recent high-profile resignations at Yahoo, now’s the time to submit a résumé! Executives have been quitting in droves — most recently, the founders of Flickr and Delicious both resigned. Start looking for your job here.Food Buzz A new amusement bath park in Japan features a “ramen soup bath.” It’d be awesome if David Chang’s next project was to open a ramen soup bathhouse.A NSFW French ad that explores the deep seas of sexuality.Culture Buzz A Russian spa erects a monument to the enema. The history of tribute for the enema has been irregular at best. Finally, the enema gets washed in a free flow of praise. The monument will help cleanse the murky history of this misaligned procedure who’s narrative has been congested with ill acclaim. (via osf)Food Buzz A Burger King location in London has launched a Kobe Beef burger that sells for $200. ‘The Burger’ as it is known, features Wagyu beef, white truffles, Pata Negra ham slices, Cristal onion straws, Modena balsamic vinegar, lambs lettuce, pink Himalayan rock salt, organic white wine and shallot infused mayonnaise in an Iranian saffron and white truffle dusted bun. All the proceeds from the burger go to a children’s charity, but I still can’t see spending $200 on a burger without cheese.Science Buzz The NASA Phoenix Mars mission says they’ve found proof of water on the Red Planet. Small white patches that the Phoenix lander discovered when digging into the Martian soil earlier this week have shrunk, and bits of debris in the trench have disappeared, which NASA says could only mean they were ice.Obama’s first general election campaign ad.Tech Buzz Hyundai has released a television that allows you to watch 3-D programs, but it’s only available in Japan. The future is now! And it looks like the 80s.Music Buzz Download the new album. Check out the song list on the Wikipedia page. I personally can’t wait to hear the Cure’s “In Between Days” mashed up against Usher’s “Love in This Club.”Culture Buzz London hosts the “celebration of social games,” where digital and real-life play come together to result in what some might consider performance art, while others might call simply having fun (in an especially nerdy way). If you missed Come Out And Play, now’s your best chance to make up for all those beautiful sunny afternoons you spent holed up in the basement playing Oregon Trail.Food Buzz A neoprene sleeve for that pint of Ben \u0026 Jerry’s. Now a pint will finally last me through two full episodes of Golden Girls! Excuse me while I cry myself to sleep.Either something got into their Ensure, or these septuagenarians have some serious steam to blow off.Tech Buzz The making of vaguely pornographic Spore characters — yes, Goatse was only the tip of the iceberg — is being banned by EA. From release to porn in less than 48 hours! If you’re curious, best be checking these videos out soon, before they’re all pulled down (and new ones go up in their place). EA says, “Whether it’s modeling clay, dolls or crayons, a small number of people can be counted on to use it for something inappropriate.” So true!Celebrity Buzz The nasty divorce proceedings get kind of amazing for celebrity a-holes Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards, as audio recordings surface in which Sheen calls his now ex-wife — among other insults — the N-word. Hooray for Hollywood! Sheen publicly apologized, [seriously] citing that a black guy was the best man at his first two weddings. Because as everyone knows, the best way to reform one’s racist leanings is to dress up a person of color in fancy clothes and give them an inconsequential title. Hear that, Dr. King? That’s the sound of progress!Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
