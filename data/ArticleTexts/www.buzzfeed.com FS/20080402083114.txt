In an odd reverse marketing scheme, the film - which has already been purchased by HBO Entertainment but is obligated to hold screenings in New York and L.A. to qualify for Oscar nominations - is holding very quiet showings at inconvenient times and locations and minimal publicity to ensure the film still has an eager audience when it airs on HBO in June.View the 9 Best LinksTech Buzz Ze Frank\u0027s latest project ports summer camp games to the web.
