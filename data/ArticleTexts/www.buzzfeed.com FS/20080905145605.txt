Contribute ›Rumor has it Us Weekly is losing subscribers over this cover story on Sarah Palin. Contribute ›A Radaronline editor just happened to be at a Las Vegas strip club, where he managed to get some shots of Michael Phelps grabbing some stipper’s ass. Contribute ›Food Buzz The brewing discontent of the cupcake-haters. We’ve already seen them banned in schools. Will the expansion of Crumbs, a cupcake place that’s growing at a Krispy Kreme-like pace, turn more people against the lowly cupcake? Contribute ›Politics Buzz A Republican senator calls the Obamas part of an elite, “uppity” class of liberals. Oh, the irony. Next up, we’ll be discussing Cindy McCain’s modest yet humble $300,000 dress. Contribute ›A tasty, healthy treat from Portland, OR. Contribute ›Tech Buzz A simple weather site that answers just one question. You can check for rain by ZIP code and subscribe to get daily morning text messages to let you know if you need to back a brolly. Contribute ›Yes, it’s what The Daily Show is known best for: recognizing hypocritical blowhards in politics. But this clip, in which Jon Stewart so effortlessly lambasts right-wing luminaries Karl Rove and Bill O’Reilly as they bemoan the alleged sexism being faced by Sarah Palin, is a must-see. Contribute ›Science Buzz An international robotic program for kids ages 9 to 14 is a sort of geek olympics. It’s like the math olympics for the new generation. I’m sort of jealous that geeks are becoming more and more accepted in society. We never had it this good when we were kids! Contribute ›So maybe not all Republicans can spell, but they sure know how to draw a fine asterisk. Contribute ›TV Buzz Blake Lively and Leighton Meester will be appearing on 30 Rock in a flashback sequence that outs Liz Lemon as a former Mean Girl.

Contribute ›A chart displaying the frequency of words used by both Republican and Democratic speakers at their respective conventions. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Side-by-side pictures of the innocent child TV stars of our past who grew up to look…not so innocent. While their days on camera didn’t pan out so well, it’s good to know that they were a little more lucky with their looks. The depressing part is to think of the kids who’s looks ended up on the same trajectory as their careers. Contribute ›We told you it was coming, and now it’s here. Contribute ›John McCain needs to work on his mic placement. Contribute ›Style Buzz Cassette tapes may be out of style in the music world, but they’re making a huge comeback in fashion. Vinyl records have the market cornered for musical nostalgia, but this is the cassette tapes chance to shine. I wonder what alternative use we’ll find for iPods when they become obsolete. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Forget the horse and buggy, dysentery, and the whole Oregon thing. Thule Trail is a modern day remake of the classic game Oregon Trail. In Thule Trail you travel from Chicago to Santa Barbara to attend the Atlantis Music Festival. Choose from a SUV or Hybrid, hunt for tacos (you really shoot packages of tacos,) and boost morale by buying magazines and CD’s. Good luck.
