Not only will the Stadium Pal also significantly shorten road trips, but now you won’t have to pee in a bottle like a crazy person! (Come on, I can’t be the only one.)Culture Buzz Over 40 rabbits have been have been mysteriously murdered since last summer in the Ruhr district of Germany . The animals which were brutally beheaded and drained of blood were mostly being kept out of sight suggesting that the killers maybe using Google Earth to track them down. Whether internet savvy Satanists are the culprits or just sadistic teenagers Germans are being warned to keep their pets locked away.Politics Buzz The Obama daughters are interviewed for the first time on Access Hollywood. They’re so cute! I bet if they wrote a blog, it would be a lot less cringeworthy than Meghan McCain’s.Culture Buzz Who said summer has to be about campfires, bug juice, and swimming? This extensive list of extreme summer camps will trade in the s’mores and water guns for other signature summer fun like Scientology lessons and “dietary restriction-themed storybooks.” For example, at the Ted Nugent Kamp For Kids, the staff “gets kids out of the malls and off the streets, into the woods and in touch with the natural healing powers of the wild.” And then they shoot animals in cold blood.Tech Buzz 25 nerdy computer pranks to pull on the unsuspecting coworker.

Is it just me or do the characters look kinda of like adorable, plushy stuffed animal versions of turds?Culture Buzz The bloggers at Jezebel get chewed out for being allegedly drunk and saying irresponsible things while appearing on Lizz Winstead’s show. I love Jezebel. It’s sort of like Sassy magazine for the old haggard wastoid version of myself: less Cute Band Alerts, more rape jokes and sketchy birth control methods.Style Buzz Dutch artist Eric Klarenbeek has created jewelry for your eyeballs. The contact lenses with dangling charms venture into uncharted territory of self-adornment. If you have to wear contact lenses anyway, why not add some flair?Tech Buzz As usual, the big dailies get to review Apple’s newest phone before anyone else. No surprises: They like it! Beyond the fact that the two-year pricing is actually more than the earlier version of the iPhone, the only other big downside is that the GPS isn’t powerful enough to provide step-by-step driving directions, which is kind of a bummer.Style Buzz Pop Topping is the art of making crafts from soda can tabs. This rich tradition was first documented back in 1975 in the book Start Off in Pop Topping and is still around today.
