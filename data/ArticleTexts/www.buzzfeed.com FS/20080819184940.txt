Contribute ›24-year-old Angel Pantoja Medina of Puerto Rico requested to be kept upright for his wake. Contribute ›A man defending himself tries to fake a heart attack to get out of his trial. Contribute ›Culture Buzz A group of 100 college presidents have banded together in an effort to lower the drinking age. The movement, called the Amethyst Initiative, began over a year ago in hopes of starting debate over the old highway funding laws which bumped it from 18 to 21 in the first place. Naturally, MADD isn’t happy. In fact, they’re quite mad. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Artist/activist James Powderly becomes the first American detained by the Chinese at the Olympic Games. Powderly, who was protesting China’s involvement in Tibet through his work with Graffiti Research Lab, was arrested before debuting a new laser-based work. A short time later, 5 other activists were also arrested for a GRL-style protest. Contribute ›Sports Buzz Young wrestler Henry Cejudo, the son of unauthorized migrants, has just won the gold for the U.S. American nativists want him deported. Thanks to the Olympics, I’m having an epiphany that there are a lot of really racist people in the world. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Broadway musicals are dropping like flies due to tough economic times. Godspell, Brigadoon, and For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf have been scrapped before opening, and others are threatening the same. We say, what gives? Why is it that when pennies must be pinched, tap shoes and glitter are always the first things to go? Sigh. Contribute ›Tech Buzz There’s something odd about watching the faces in a few recent motion-capture CGI demos. Something…uncanny. New technology has allowed animators to make CGI faces look more and more like real live moving corpses. Should they scale back toward cartoons? Contribute ›An angry but real obituary that recently ran in the Times-Herald of Napa/Sonoma. Contribute ›A round-up of girls kissing at the Olympics. Contribute ›Dan Cameron has mapped out Springfield, fictional home to none other than The Simpsons. Contribute ›Sports Buzz The Australian swimmer wins gold, has a golden smile. Sure, three gold medals aren’t Phelp’s eight, but Rice is poised to become a big star in her native Australia and abroad after these games. She also has a penchant for posing in revealing clothes. Contribute ›Sports Buzz Lego enthusiasts from Hong Kong have created a miniature Beijing Olympics! Made up of 300,000 Lego bricks and over 4,500 Lego people, the miniature Lego city includes the infamous Bird’s Nest Stadium, Michael Phelps’ Water Cube, and George W. Bush’s favorite Olympic hot spot, Beach Volleyball! All in all, it measures an impressive 10ft by 26ft. Contribute ›Music Buzz Everyone’s favorite online mixtape genius site, Muxtape, is down today, after having been touched by the music police, aka the RIAA. It was only a matter of time (sadly), but we hope this gets resolved soon. Muxtapes are too good of a work distraction to be gone for long. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz He’s been twittering since June, but John Cleese just got noticed by a thousand new followers. He’s taking it well. (And yes, this seems to truly be Cleese.) The Monty Python alum is also blogging and “headcasting.” Contribute ›TV Buzz The Bob Saget Roast that aired on Comedy Central Sunday night was funny, but would have been ratings gold had the bevy of naughty Olsen sisters jokes (and there were MANY) made it to the broadcast. The banned zingers were mostly about the twin’s alleged promiscuity and eating troubles, and granted, were probably inappropriate for a mass audience. Example!: Jeffrey Ross said, “Is it true you used to give Mary-Kate acting lessons? He’d tell her, “Act like this never happened.” She’d be like, “You got it, dude.”“ Contribute ›Sports Buzz After 8 golds, the internet begins wondering: Is Michael Phelps a douchebag? All he does is eat, sleep, and swim, but he still leaves just a little bit of time to be a douche. Contribute ›An unidentified Miami man tries to kite surf during Tropical Storm Fay. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Chicago artist/performer Robyn Okrant is documenting a year living life according to The Big O, following every suggestion and instruction preached by the media mogul. Personally, I would totally “Live Gayle,” but my best friend doesn’t have any money to give me. Contribute ›Stephanie Brown-Trafton hurled the discus a whopping 212 feet, 5 inches to grab the first US Women’s gold in the event in 76 years.
