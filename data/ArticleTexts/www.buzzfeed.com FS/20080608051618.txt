{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Popcorn kernels magically pop when the cell phones start ringing — how does it work?Movie Buzz A war of words between Spike Lee and Clint Eastwood. Lee criticized Eastwood for not having any black actors in his Iwo Jima movies, so Clint responded with, “A guy like him should shut his face.” Game on! And no, this definitely has nothing to do with generating Oscar buzz.Science Buzz Some medical experts question how Prozac is affecting American troops. Active troops were banned from taking psychotropic drugs until 2004. Now 20% of troops in Afghanistan have joined 30 million Americans prescribed with Prozac. “There’s no question [military officials are] using them to prop people up in difficult circumstances,” says Harvard Medical Psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Glenmullen. Is Prozac a quick-fix for troops with emotional trauma?Tech Buzz Peter Gabriel has launched a new site that acts as your “little friend” online, aggregating recommendations in entertainment based on your taste. Early reviews are mixed, but we’re pressed to believe that with his taste in mix tapes, Lloyd Dobler would be a fan.Sports Buzz According to the official Site, these “psychedelic sensually interactive” battery-powered hula hoops are ideal for parties, dances, and raves. Despite the fact that they are likely most popular among those who continue to don Jncos and baby pacifiers, the manchild in us is pretty much enchanted by the prospect of how awesome a PSI-Hoop would fare around a summer campfire.Culture Buzz Dolls made to resemble kids with Down Syndrome: politically correct attempt at inclusion or cringe-inducing marketing plan at the expense of kids? Some might consider these dolls offensive, but has anyone seen the Bratz dolls? Those things are straight-up creepy. (Honestly, when did little girls start aspiring to look like drag queens? Oh yeah .)Culture Buzz As the movie approaches its second week in theaters, it continues to make news, as media outlets are making claims of rampant sexism in the film’s critical reception. Personally, we think the most offensive part of the movie is Jennifer Hudson’s role meant to simply fill the color quota. But, whatever, let’s fight about shoes.Cult web game becomes a mainstream ad for Micky D’s.New iPhone is thinner, comes in red and black, supports video chat, and runs on the faster 3G network.Sports Buzz Ana Ivanovic won her first Grand Slam title at the French Open becoming the new No. 1. Twenty year-old Ivanovic is the first Serbian to win the honor. In a sport in which so many all-star players vent their frustrations on the court, Ivanovic’s trademark smile and grace under pressure make her a breath of fresh air.The Transportation Security Administration has installed a number of people-scanners at airports that can see through your clothes.It’s just so rare that someone takes the time to write graffiti that amounts to “meh”.Sports Buzz Pee discretely on the golf course (as opposed to what you normally do). A “leak proof” [sic] half-liter bottle disguised as the handle of a 7-iron lets you relieve yourself on the links without attracting attention. A golf club is basically an extension of the penis anyway, right?Culture Buzz German writer/TV personality’s first book — an intimate look at women’s hygiene and sexuality — is causing a stir. Roche’s Feuchtgebiete (wetlands) is a best seller and source of controversy in Germany, starting a national conversation about the way women are viewed and view themselves. Roche is already a star there for her nightly talkshow, in which sex was always a big topic.Culture Buzz Working out for Jesus is easy when group classes incorporate prayer, religious tunes play overhead, and all the ladies are forced to look as unattractive as humanly possible. (Seriously: the rules call for all women to “wear tops that ‘cover their bottoms.’”) If He died for your sins, the least you can do is five more minutes on the Stairmaster, p*ssy.Culture Buzz Now that there’s a movie featuring an ugly panda, and lots of ugly panda accessories, are pandas no longer cute? It’s like the title of an Onion article: “Panda No Longer Adorable.” But it’s true. The over-saturation of pandas in the media is making me wonder if they’re still cute.Culture Buzz A second man climbed the New York Times building just hours after Alain Roberts Apparently Clarke had been talking about climbing the building (to raise awareness about Malaria obvs) for over a month and was disheartened when the Frenchmen stole his thunder. I guess Clarke decided the NYT building had enough thunder in it for the both of them and went ahead and climbed it too. Remind me again how this saves babies in Africa from Malaria?Filthy, bizarre, twisted web comic strip sure to delight and very likely offend.Celebrity Buzz In the new Whitney Port Hills-spinoff, she supposedly pals around with do-nothing socialite blogger, Olivia Palermo. She’s got that weird ageless society-gal thing, where they paradoxically look youthful and fresh-faced, yet also like rich old ladies.A mashup of the old animated Star Trek series and William Shatner’s cover of Pulp’s “Common People.”Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
