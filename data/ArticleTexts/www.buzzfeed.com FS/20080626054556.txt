A middle-aged guy from upstate New York, known only by the name Rick752, spends hours every night compiling a list, known as EasyList, of internet ad sites that enables web users to filter out advertisements entirely. His work, which is all pro-bono, is beginning to make publishers tremble like bottle-less babies. How’s that for sticking it to the man?TV Buzz The strangest, oddest, most random TV station available online. A delicious, bizarre mix of clips from Godzilla movies, ’70s action films, found footage and other things I can’t identify. Click the scene to change channels. It’s like bizarro Hulu.Celebrity Buzz Aubrey O’Day, former Making the Band 3 star and best friend of Jenna Jameson, will be playing Amber von Tussle in the Broadway musical Hairspray. You can catch the sexually charged wannabe who recently told a radio station she was “dating like five guys” in Hairspary from mid-Juy through the end of August.Sports Buzz Professional superfan gets paid $2000 a game to be loud and obnoxiously dressed in support for the home team.

Disney’s internal rating system has Wall-E doing 30% better than Ratatouille did. The movie revolves around the last remaining Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class (“Wall-E”) robot on Earth. Despite Wall-E’s script having fewer words-per-minute than any other film this year, critics are calling it “an instant classic.” Wall-E is brought to us Andrew Stanton, the genius behind Finding Nemo. The trailers (which are more like short films) already have me smitten with the the little meeping robot. Can’t wait to see the full-length feature!A rescue team from SeaWorld rescued a 900 pound melon-head whale from Playalinda Beach near NASA Tuesday.Tech Buzz Google launches an initiative to make ubiquitous and open broadband access for every American a priority in the next administration.
