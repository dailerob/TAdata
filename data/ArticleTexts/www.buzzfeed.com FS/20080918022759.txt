{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"TV Buzz Gather ‘round the TV on November 23rd and join Elvis Costello, Feist, Toby Keith, John Legend and Willie Nelson as they celebrate Christmas with Stephen Colbert. Expect a lot of duets — Colbert loves showing off his pipes. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Watch R Kelly’s first post-trial interview, which aired on BET. He doesn’t even bother trying to hide the fact that he’s still a total pedo. Contribute ›Sports Buzz Tiger Woods’ niece is a freshman at Wake Forest and out to make a name for herself in golf. She came in 26th out of 75 players, which is kind of unremarkable. But maybe she’ll get a spread in Teen Vogue or something. Contribute ›http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news...The types of people who discover bugs have unearthed a type of ant that is literally from mars. The pointy bits extending from its head are for piloting flying saucers and probing things. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz A new diet craze features IV drips chock-full of multivitamins that enable users to eat less while still getting nutrients that could also help satiate them. Why don’t they just make vitamin-infused heroin? Contribute ›Tech Buzz The movie database site gets into the video game with free movies and TV shows on its site. No there’s really no excuse to go another day without watching Dude, Where’s My Car? Contribute ›Tech Buzz T-Mobile has officially announced that the first phone running Google’s Android mobile operating system, the HTC Dream, will be unveiled in late September and in late October. It ain’t as purdy as the iPhone, but it sure does have a nifty keyboard. Contribute ›A thumb tattooed onto a stump. Amazing. Contribute ›http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2008/0...George Saunders has a long satirical piece in The New Yorker about the folksy appeal of McCain’s V.P. pick. Contribute ›Culture Buzz As the availability of urban apartment space continues to decline, a whole new style of library has begun popping up around the country. They’re tool libraries, and for just a few dollars a month members get access to a garage full of tools and community resources to help perform simple home maintenance and repair. In Philly, annual membership is only $20 a year and gets you access to cool tools like squirrel traps, lawn mowers, and chainsaws. Contribute ›Politics Buzz McCain’s top economic spokeswoman says neither he nor Palin (nor any of the candidates) would be fit to run a major corporation. Fiorina used to be the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, so you’d think she know from what she speaks when she said, “It’s a fallacy to suggest that the country is like a company.” But after this gaffe, don’t expect to see her face on TV any time soon. Contribute ›TV Buzz OMFG. EW reports that the actor will star in an upcoming run of Gossip Girl episodes as Aaron Rose, Serena’s new, boho love interest. The dude (weirdly already a regular on teen heartthrob websites) has a background in skateboarding and playing the acoustic guitar…so like, typecasting, right? Contribute ›Culture Buzz Collections of tip jars with witty pleas to give up your extra pocket change. Tip jars are a common fixture in the service industry. So common, that they have to find clever ways to grab your attention. In the end, if the service doesn’t convince you to shell out the extra cash, maybe the entertainment will. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Beau Willimon’s new play is making waves as both an off-Broadway debut and an upcoming film. The stage show (about a political press secretary) opens in New York in October with a cast that includes Chris Noth, Olivia Thirlby, and Isaiah Whitlock Jr. (aka that guy from The Wire). George Clooney is attached to direct the Hollywood version. We repeat: Beau Willimon. Get to know the name, the kid is going places! Contribute ›Business Buzz Investors can now put their money into Adult Entertainment Capital, the first publicly traded and licensed investment opportunity for all types of adult business—from gentlemen’s clubs to lifestyle resorts, content and emerging technology platforms. With the impending financial apocalypse, this kind of seems like the only safe place to put your money. Porn seems a lot less volatile than technology or pharmaceuticals. Contribute ›We just got this angry email from a guy upset with BuzzFeed’s coverage of McCain. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz On her talk show today, Ellen DeGeneres will officially announce her role as the new face of CoverGirl, joining supermodel alums like Christie Brinkley and Niki Taylor. Hey, if anyone epitomizes easy, breezy, beautiful - it’s a fifty-year-old hysterical lesbian who rarely gets dolled up. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz In October, Elizabeth Banks will be playing both a porn star and first lady Laura Bush within a two week span at the movies. In Oliver Stone’s W, Ms. Banks plays the very non-pornographic Laura Bush, where she gets to be “a character actor in a leading lady’s body”. Then, a week later, she takes her clothes off in Seth Rogan’s Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Contribute ›The early 1980s Christian Ska band, Sonseed, has resurfaced via viral video. Hallelujah! Contribute ›Tech Buzz The “Netflix for magazines” from Time Inc. is in beta at long last… And it isn’t half bad! There are 240 titles, and for only $5/month, you can get three magazines you wouldn’t normally buy on the newsstand or subscribe to full price (here’s looking at you, Martha Stewart Living/Best Life!) delivered to your doorstep. Until this thing (inevitably) goes out of business, it’s pretty fun to try out. Contribute ›Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
