{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Business Buzz CBS is buying CNET for $1.8 billion. In a surprise move, the broadcast giant is snapping up CNET’s large network of online sites.TV Buzz MTV’s spinoff to My Super Sweet Sixteen will send fan “favorites” to third world countries, where they’ll learn truly valuable lessons in how to be less terrible human beings. With The Paper receiving rave reviews across the board, it was only a matter of time before the network reset their focus on the crux of their most successful programming: spoiled brats.Style Buzz A slew of designers are making jewelry using elements of living organisms. These pieces though cruelty-free are either made from or inspired by parts of actual insects or sea creatures. I love things that pretty yet at the same time very creepy.Music Buzz A Photoshop contest where people have taken classic album covers and imagined what could have been going on outside the frame. This bemusing series of photoshopped images takes Sleeveface a step further.Tech Buzz She’s been named as Playboy’s 2008 Cyber Girl of the Year. She loves Final Fantasy because of all the “sidequests.” Which reminds me: RPG porn does exist (and is not safe for work, of course)!Politics Buzz The state’s Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to overturn the ban. In the opinion written by Chief Justice Ron George, the court says that ultimately, “domestic partnerships are not a good enough substitute for marriage.”Science Buzz Scientists discover the most recently exploded supernova in our galaxy. By “baby,” they mean it exploded 26,000 years ago (Baby Supernova would also make a good band name).Culture Buzz Afrigadget is a website chronicling ingenuity of African inventors who use simple materials to solve big problems. Yay uplifting Bono-free news from Africa. My favorites are the home-made helicopter, the Knife Sharpening Bicycle and the Solar Powered Mobile Phone Charger.Culture Buzz Hated equally by Gen X and the Greatest Generation, the up-and-coming Millennials are coming under fire. Re-heated generational stereotypes, or legitimate cultural fisticuffs? You be the judge.Tech Buzz Houson, Texas is being invaded by so called “crazy rasberry ants”, that came over on a cargo boat. Apparently, they infest electronic devices and can ruin computers and even gas meters. They’re like the bedbugs of the tech world! Reading about these ants is giving me that creepy-crawly tingly scalp feeling, not unlike the feeling I get from looking at manbabies.Culture Buzz These kits help women collect evidence on their own after a rape, but were always prohibitively expensive. Starting in 2009, all states will be required to pay for anonymous rape kits in order to continue receiving funding. Well, there’s not much good news to give rape victims, but at least now, prosecuting rape cases will get a lot easier starting in 2009. It’s nice to see our country progressing in some form.Business Buzz An attempt to gauge what people really think about brands via the power of tagging. Users are presented with a wide variety of brand logos — from ABC and Absolut to YouTube and Zune — and asked to tag them with the first word that pops into their heads. You can then see the user-generated tag cloud and see what other people think about the same brands.Politics Buzz Edwards is expected to make his announcement at a rally in Michigan tonight. Edwards has held out for a long time, and his wife still appears to be supporting Clinton, but Edwards has recently been saying Obama is “clearly the nominee,” and his endorsement will come tonight.Food Buzz Chicago lifts its foie gras ban, foodies rejoice. With the ban’s sponsor shouting objections, the City Council finally voted to overturn its ban on duck (or goose) liver, specially fattened via force-feeding. Chicago’s finer restaurants will no doubt be busy tonight.Science Buzz Biologist, Jason Bond discovered a new species of trapdoor spider which he has named Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi in honor of his favorite musician. Young joins the ranks of the late rock ‘n’ roll legend Roy Orbison who has a whirligig beetleOrectochilus orbisonorum named to honor him. I’m not sure if this makes spiders lovable or even creepier.Celebrity Buzz Pete Doherty plants one on Amy Winehouse, and the world realizes what a beautiful couple they’d make. At first glance, this seemed too trashy to post, but now it kind of serves the purpose of being diametrically opposed to the Scarlett-Penelope kiss.Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
