That sound you hear is the collective slamming of SUV driver’s-side doors as wannabe-MILF’s race to the finish to see who can find Liquid Virgin first. Alas, it’s only available on teh netz. (Thanks for the tip, Sara!)A simple plea to car thieves.Food Buzz The FDA announces the Great Tomato Scare of Aught Eight is finally over. Thank god we all survived! For a while there, we couldn’t even get beefsteak tomatoes on our pizza. Now the FDA is saying tomatoes might never have been the source of the outbreak to begin with. Watch out for those peppers, though!Creepy and fascinating, the goop takes on a life of its own over a vibrating subwoofer.Culture Buzz Disney’s first film to feature an African-American princess has already caused a considerable amount of controversy.
