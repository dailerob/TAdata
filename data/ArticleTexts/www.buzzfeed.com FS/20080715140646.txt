{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Sports Buzz A group of rock climbers called the Stone Nudes do it with no clothing or special shoes or equipment. Images of the climbers have been captured in a 2009 calendar, and they happen to all be hot girls. Which is too bad, because I only buy calendars featuring fat balding men or playful kittens.Politics Buzz An inspiring love story ends in divorce. She nursed her injured Marine to health and married him despite the fact that his face was completely disfigured by the blast from a suicide bomber. Now they are getting divorced. Having a national holiday created to honor your love is probably too much pressure for any marriage to bear.Business Buzz Xbox 360 owners with subscriptions to Netflix will soon be able to stream movies and TV shows directly to their consoles. And with the addition of the Live Party feature, which allows users to view streamed content with up to eight people who aren’t even in the room, you can now withdraw further into your virtual cocoon.Feist will appear on the 39th season of Sesame Street singing a modified version of “1,2,3,4”.Food Buzz A site that asks users to submit photos of their fridge. What’s remarkable is not the differences but how similar all fridges tend to look — a few bottled items, some produce, something in a container, a few jars. Where are the avant garde fridges out there?An exposed “police officer” detains a fully-clothed streaker.Culture Buzz A series of photoshopped images of animals in sexy poses. Don’t worry, the images are safe for work — it’s really more like soft-porn. There is something about the sight of a coquettish camel and cow straddling a fence that is just hilarious.A rash of fake roads signs in Australia is causing confusion and hilarity.Tech Buzz Mischievous geeks are manipulating Google Trends to make offensive words appear to be hot search trends. First the number one result was a swastika symbol. Then the words “fuck you google” flipped backwards to get past the spam filters. Some say the 4chan bulletin is causing the problem by picking offensive words and getting the whole community to search for them — thereby creating a self-fulfilling Google trend. Personally we would never do anything like that because we think s??o? spu??? ?l?oo?.Radiohead’s latest music video was filmed without any cameras, using only lasers.Tech Buzz A more violent typing game than the adorable Type Racer, the Typing Ninja Hunter employs your word speed to fend off attacking ninjas. The early levels of this game are too easy for the average typist, but there’s something so satisfying in hearing a groan of death each time you type a word.Tech Buzz Julia Allison’s latest venture is Nonsociety, a website where she and her two best blogger friends, Mary Rambin and Meghan Asha, will post video blog entries. The three plan to expand Nonsociety by adding more contributors in the coming months. Sounds to me like Nonsociety is trying to be an online New York media version of The Hills.Celebrity Buzz The 19-year-old girl allegedly stole Rolling Stones’ 61-year-old Ron Wood away from his wife and four kids. The photos have that raw, cover-of-an-emo-band’s-album feel to them. I would love to find her LiveJournal and see what that’s all about.Celebrity Buzz Next up in her never-ending parade of photo scandals: Photos of Miley showering, hacked from her iPhone. The image will probably cause more sanctimony and outrage even though actually shows less skin than her Vanity Fair photoshoot. There’s also a shot of her blowing air kisses at her iPhone — the hacker who claims to have found them say they were sent to Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers.Politics Buzz The NY Times revived an issue that got buried months ago: John McCain was born in the Panama Canal, making him ineligible for the Presidency. Doh! The Republicans are truly f*cked if this is the case. However, John McCain has survived this long, I doubt that this tiny stipulation would keep him down.Music Buzz The 60-year-old actress/model has a new album on the way and a new video for the first time in 19 years. It’s not as catchy as Alicia Keys’ “No One,” but Grace Jones’ new video is so quintessentially avant-garde early-80s, it’ll make you yearn for the days when MTV actually played videos like this.Culture Buzz This site teaches you the contemporary execution of ancient Japanese art, focusing on speed and imagination rather than on the technicalities. Please disregard this if you actually take origami seriously in any way.For the second year running, the Miss USA entrant in the Miss Universe contest has a slip-n-fall on stage.Tech Buzz The first pictures of an (apparently) functional version of Blackberry’s touch-screen device have shown up on the web. The Thunder is Blackberry’s response to the iPhone, and they’re hoping to make the touch screen typing experience way better than what Apple offers — the screen will provide tactile feedback when you press a key, and there’s a lot more screen real estate dedicated to the keyboard.Celebrity Buzz Ethan Hawke has married his former nanny in secret. Shawhughes was originally hired by Uma Thurman to look after the two children she and Hawke had together. Now the former nanny is about to give birth to her first child with Hawke, and his rep admits the couple was secretly married in New York last month. If only Sarah Larson had been so lucky with Clooney!Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
