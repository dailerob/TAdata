{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Music Buzz The highly anticipated 3-D video version for Björk\u0027s latest single \"Wanderlust\" will have its nationwide debut on April 20. How fitting that the video would be released on 4.20. She hasn\u0027t announced the online location yet, but you can watch the video in almost-unbridled glory here.View the 13 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz The French actress who plays Fleur Delacour in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has become a darling of the fashion world. Already well established as an \u0027It-Girl\u0027 in her native France, Poesy is now making waves in the U.S. fashion scene.

Stephanopoulos was \"somewhat taken aback\" at first by the sustained furor sent his way. We can understand: We take a lot of email heat any time we post anything having to do with animals being harmed. We just report the facts, people!View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz Although many would hope this term connoted hot girl-on-girl action, it\u0027s something much simpler: adoration by women for women. Audrey Hepburn, Chelsea Clinton, and Gwyneth Paltrow score points with gals for the ease with which they exude class and intelligence. Keep your fingers crossed - if Britney can manage to stay sane and keep her ironic tee shirts free of Spaghetti-O stains, she\u0027ll be right up there beside her pseudo-British sisters soon enough.View the 21 Best LinksCulture Buzz A staggering blog written by Jill Leovy of the LA Times tells the accounts of every single murder that happens in Los Angeles. If you\u0027re obsessed with real-life murder, this blog is a must-read.

Combine the operatic stylings of Antony Hegarty and the cheesy synth-bass of early 90s club hits, and you\u0027ve got something that will make the punk kids dance.View the 11 Best LinksTV Buzz Good news for both Clinton and Obama: The Colbert Bump is real, if you\u0027re a democrat. A political scientist has taken a hard look at the evidence, and it looks like appearing on The Colbert Report is good for Democrats, bad for Republicans. We don\u0027t understand the physics involved, but he\u0027s got a graph and everything, so science wins again.View the 7 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz Rachel Bilson and Lily Allen have gone blonde this past week. If Natalie Portman and Zooey Deschanel follow suit, we might have to call this a Hollywood tragedy.View the 7 Best LinksStyle Buzz The BBC has launched a new online magazine dedicated to eco-conscious style. Thread has articles on how to read your clothing labels,sweatshops, where to find ethically produced garments, as well as fashions that are actually stylish.

That really is a Volkswagen logo floating up in the sky.View the 7 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz Vladimir Putin dumped his wife and is planning to marry an Olympic gymnast half his age. 24-year-old Kabaeva was known for her \"extreme natural flexibility\" - she won a gold in the all-around at the 2004 Athens Olympics - but is now retired from gymnastics and has been elected to the Russian parliament...as a representative of Putin\u0027s party.View the 8 Best LinksBusiness Buzz Fallout from Facebook\u0027s Beacon ad platform takes on the concrete form of a civil lawsuit. The Beacon backlash continues: A woman in Texas has filed suit against Blockbuster for revealing her rental choices without permission, violating the 1988 Videotape Privacy Protection Act. Facebook isn\u0027t named in the suit.View the 4 Best LinksStyle Buzz This puffy Marc by Marc Jacobs headband as seen on Mary-Kate Olsen is the obvious evolutionary progression from the Prada turban. The only way to prove you\u0027re a slave to fashion is by wearing headgear that is, objectively speaking, crazy.View the 8 Best LinksTech Buzz In the future, dishwashers and sinks will use sound waves to clean. This looks like a record player; it\u0027s not, but just like with record players, we have no idea how it works. Somehow, using a megasonic pulse means you don\u0027t have to use detergent.View the 6 Best LinksTech Buzz Ricky Gervais will be doing three minutes of new material; Karl Lagerfield will also make an appearance in the video game. Well, that\u0027s all we know so far, which seems kind of random, but as we near the release date of April 29th, we\u0027ll probably find out more. In the meantime, read the first official review of the game.View the 8 Best LinksMusic Buzz People are saying good things about her upcoming album of Tom Waits covers, Anywhere I Lay My Head.

Her exhibition will feature video recordings of these forced miscarriages as well as preserved collections of the blood from the process. Finally, something that pro-lifers AND pro-choicers can agree on! Now both sides of the controversial debate can concur that gratuitous abortion art is pretty despicable.View the 19 Best LinksCulture Buzz A group of moms in Spain find themselves in debt after trying to create a fund-raising calendar and failing. It\u0027s like the opposite of Calendar Girls: Well-meaning moms in the cash-strapped rural village of Serradilla del Arroyo got together to pose provocatively in order to try to come up with new money for the town\u0027s school. Now they\u0027re left with 5,000 unsold copies and owe the printer $16,000. (Thanks for the tip!)View the 4 Best LinksStyle Buzz Chloe Sevigny\u0027s character Nicki wears frilly, pastel-colored frocks on the show Big Love. She manages to make even dowdy mormonwear look kind of edgy. Does this mean it\u0027s okay to wear your Easter dress year-round?View the 3 Best LinksCulture Buzz A new book that finally explains mommy\u0027s nosejob to the little ones. With the growing popularity of mommy makeovers, we suppose there are a lot of kiddies out there trying to understand why mommy went away to the hurt doctor and couldn\u0027t lift anything for weeks when she got back. Finally a self-published book that will let them deal with their anxieties in a healthy way!View the 7 Best LinksStyle Buzz Kellogg\u0027s Cereal has released a line street wear in conjunction with a company called Under the Hood. This line of jackets, jeans, hoodies and \u0027tees\u0027 are emblazoned with your favorite cereal icon: Toucan Sam, Tony the Tiger, Dig\u0027Em the Frog and Cornelius the Rooster. This has to be the most ridiculous attempt to urbanize a brand, ever.View the 6 Best LinksCulture Buzz We think this blog crudely illustrating CNN\u0027s dumbest headlines is pretty brilliant. Sure, there\u0027s bombs going off in Baghdad, but when we hit the CNN frontpage, we expect real news, like, \"Man wears skirt to mow lawn, breaks law.\"View the 5 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Spain\u0027s first female defense minister is also 7 months pregnant. Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero is making bold gestures in favor of women\u0027s equality and trying to create a more humanitarian image for the Spanish military. A good idea, given that both Zapatero and the majority of the Spanish population are anti-war and resisting sending more troops to Afghanistan. Viva España!View the 7 Best LinksMovie Buzz Another day, another sumer blockbuster now shrouded in a cloud of crappiness. With reports of a bloated running time (140 minutes) and rumors that \"the movie may not have turned out to be what people in the industry call \u0027good\u0027,\" Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull looks like it may not be the summer savior Hollywood had been hoping for.View the 5 Best LinksSports Buzz With 17 fatalities on the slopes already this year, Colorado\u0027s ski areas are suddenly under scrutiny. There\u0027s a minor debate going over why there\u0027s been a sudden spike in ski area deaths: Too many snowboarders? New, fast equipment? Too many groomed runs, where people go too fast? Statistical randomness? File this under stuff nobody likes.View the 5 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz The pet chow of Martha Stewart has passed away and is remembered in a photo essay on his famous owner\u0027s blog. For a lady whose heart many would claim is the color of gun metal, Martha really manages to tactfully handle the process of grieving for a pet (although her wrapping the corpse is, admittedly, mildly creepy).View the 6 Best LinksSports Buzz ESPN sideline reporter has quite the YouTube following, including 1 million hits on a video that\u0027s just a slideshow of random photos of her.

We bet her hair smells like strawberries.View the 10 Best LinksCulture Buzz Their sketch show on the BBC, That Mitchell And Webb Look, have earned them hardcore fans on both sides of the pond.
