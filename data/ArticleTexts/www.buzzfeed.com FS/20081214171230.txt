He won a Nobel Prize in 1997 and is currently the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-shehori/poll-37-of-a...According to a Gallup/Harris poll released Monday, a full 37 percent of American citizens are incapable of identifying their home country on a map of the United States.Now with a bigger box! Maru has clearly learned to play with proportion: a larger box makes for a tinier, cuter kitty.Science Buzz In honor of the 1,000, primarily creepy new species that were discovered in the Greater Mekong this week, let\u0027s create a collection of the scariest-looking animals of all time. If you need an antidote after you\u0027ve put in some hard time building this collection, just type in “kittens” in the search bar at the top of the page and that should sort you out. In the meantime, upload an image below of your nomination for the world\u0027s creepiest animal.Sports Buzz Tiger Woods\u0027 caddy is in the hotseat after publicly mocking Phil Mickelson and his saggy chest. Steve Williams told an anecdote about Mickelson being heckled for his man-tits. Mickelson denied the story, claiming the man-tits in question belonged to a European Tour player. For what it\u0027s worth, Mickelson does look like he could use some support, though his hot wife doesn\u0027t seem to mind.Style Buzz Here\u0027s my own list of hot models, that I\u0027ve compiled from my lengthy hours of perusing vintage clothing on eBay. I\u0027ve bought so many ill-fitting dresses from online vintage shops because they looked so stunning on the models.http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28239826/After eight years of war, torture, and lies, you know what we\u0027re going to miss most about the Bush administration? The annual Christmas video about Barney the Dog! This Olympic-themed final installment is especially cute, if only because Barney wears goggles! GO AMERICA!The cable company assembled a cheeky calendar boasting its hottest employees. Well, there\u0027s one way to make your staff forget about looming layoffs.Sports Buzz It must be a UK thing — visit 18 different pubs, in 18 different locations, drinking 18 different previously-specified achoholic drinks. Deduct two points if you puke. There are few funner things than getting wasted while wearing an argyle vest. Um, why don\u0027t we have this in America??Politics Buzz Well, that didn\u0027t take long. Here\u0027s a collection of some of the animated gifs that are being made of Bush getting beaned by stuff in the aftermath of yesterday\u0027s shoe-throwing incident. If you\u0027re feeling extra fancy, you can send us your own and we\u0027ll add it to the collection.http://www.instructables.com/id/Make_Skeeball_inspired_Ga...This is how you make homemade skeeball out of party materials (which you connect to a “virtual pizza” on your PC). Essentially, you can create a nerdy grade school kid\u0027s fantasy party, but probably with beer.Science Buzz More than 1,000 new species have been discovered in the Greater Mekong, including a dragon millipede and a spider “as big as a dinner plate.” They are all equally freaky and wondrous, but the Heteropoda dagmarae will haunt me for decades.Celebrity Buzz Recently nominated for her supporting role in Doubt, the Julliard-trained Rhode Island native has hit the ground running, earning endless praise for a role that keeps Davis onscreen for less than ten minutes.

See for yourself.Sports Buzz Everyone\u0027s trying to find out more about Sondra Fortunato on Google today. Sondra Fortunato is a Giants superfan who was forcibly removed from the game this weekend because her outfit was offending other people in the stadium. Ms. Fortunato, who\u0027s been a fixture at Giants games for more than 30 years, was wearing a Santa Claus outfit complete with a tiara, fishnet stockings, a bathing suit bottom and high-heeled boots. Fortunato defended herself vigorously against the charges, saying, “”Nothing was showing. You couldn\u0027t even see my underwear. I don\u0027t flash!”Ladies, pay attention. This video will walk you through the difficult and sometimes confusing process of snaring yourself a man. Recommended conversation topics from the video include “a small stuffed animal, interesting pieces of jewelry, a sports magazine, or a T-shirt with a slogan.” Us guys just melt for that kind of talk. And don\u0027t be afraid to just sit and stare at the guy in question. \u0027Cuz that\u0027s not creepy at all.http://www.jossip.com/43545-20081215/So Bush almost took a pair of shoes to the face over the weekend, but he\u0027s hardly the first celebrity/politician to get nailed. Here are clips of Bill Gates, Lindsay Lohan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ann Coulter, Thomas Friedman and Pat Buchanan all getting pied or floured. Cue Nelson Muntz.Madonna bites it during a concert in Brazil. Honestly, the rest of the dance sequence is so discombobulated that I\u0027m not sure I would have noticed.Politics Buzz The New York Times unearths a bizarre detail about Governor Rod Blagojevich: aides must keep his black Paul Mitchell hairbrush on hand at all times. He calls it “the football,” after the “nuclear football” - the bomb codes that are always within reach of the president. Because f*cking with Rod\u0027s insane hair would be as disastrous as nuclear Armageddon.
