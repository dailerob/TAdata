And way too many beets. And not even one mention of fried chicken and biscuits.Business Buzz Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlanes has a deal in the works to make a web series for Google. The series, 50 two-minute-long episodes, will run in the AdSense slot on various web sites. The mini-episodes will only play when clicked on, and Google will be charging a higher advertising rate than for the usual AdSense slots. Will the future of Google advertising be content?Culture Buzz From the guy behind Overheard in New York, it’s a site where you can predict whether married couples will stay together. This is something I do sometimes while perusing the weddings section of The New York Times when I feel too lazy to read about stuff like culture and the Iraq War. Now you can do it online!Prostitutes in Madrid have taken to the catwalk as part of a campaign to stake their claim over the streets they walk.Movie Buzz As more reviews of The Dark Knight keep rolling in, Heath Ledger as the Joker is getting all the attention. Peter Travers’ review in Rolling Stone kicked off the Oscar chatter, but most other people who’ve seen the movie seem to agree that Leger is amazing in the role.Style Buzz Hip hop moguls Jay-Z and Diddy have both praised the benefits of waxing…down there. It may be a couple of years after the fact, but it seems like Outkast really broke through to these guys, persuading them to get “so fresh and so clean.”Bond is back, and he’s very, very angry.After hearing that Noel Gallagher said he didn’t want Jay-Z performing at Glastonbury, Jay-Z does a cover of “Wonderwall.”The technology isn’t quite there yet for the 3G iPhone, but holograph messaging may eventually replace voicemail, email and texting as the favorite mode of communication among the tech-enabled.Tech Buzz A Japanese guy created an insanely difficult Super Mario World. In case you weren’t balding enough, here’s an activity that will make you really want to tear your hair out.Business Buzz A new design for plastic milk jugs reduces its carbon footprint, drives cereal eaters crazy. It cuts down on packaging, shipping costs (and fuel usage) and creates less waste. Unfortunately, it’s also harder to pour.Politics Buzz General Wesley Clark questions McCain’s Vietnam War experience, which is basically the entire basis for his presidential campaign. The McCain supporters have their panties in a bunch of the remark. But how could anyone hate such a friendly face?The Iranian leader’s wife is a total babe.Control your ride from inside the giant ball with dual motor configuration!Celebrity Buzz The actress — who made a full recovery from a recent brain aneurysm (although she is still battling multiple sclerosis) — has resurfaced in two indies, reminding us how much we missed her.

Premieres online in 3 parts: July 15, 17, and 19 (and only available for free until the 20th).Sports Buzz The 19-year-old just set the world record for the 400-meter individual medley at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials.
