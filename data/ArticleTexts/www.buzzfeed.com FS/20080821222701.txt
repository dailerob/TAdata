Contribute ›Zazzle Keds let you create shoes with any image on them, and a BuzzFeed contributor takes the idea to its logical conclusion. Contribute ›Tech Buzz A bookmarking site that acts as your own personal Wayback machine. Iterasi lets you create an archive of a web page — pictures, design and all — and then schedule updates to be saved in the future, every day, every week or every month. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Jessica Simpson is now spokesperson and investor in Stampede Light Plus, a new Texas beer. Wearing a cowgirl hat, an unbuttoned shirt, and sitting on piles of hay, Jessica proclaims she likes “a cold beer once in a while” in her new ad. Just like I drink “once or twice a week”…right, Jess? Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz A Page Six blind item asks which Hollywood hunk in a summer movie is a violent, closeted homosexual who ass-raped a victim and sent him to the hospital? The speculation is flying! James Franco, Will Smith, and Christian Bale are all suspects. My ass aches just thinking about all the possibilities! Contribute ›Sports Buzz The Paraguayan javelin thrower is dating tennis star Novak Djockovic. Time is running out to run posts about Olympic hotties, so today it’s Franco’s turn. She placed 51st in the javelin throw (it’s her second time at the Olympics) but supports her athletics career by doing swimsuit modeling on the side. That’s dedication. Contribute ›Politics Buzz Obama supporters sign up to get a text from the campaign when he picks a VP. Someone finds a way to spoof texts from the campaign. Hilarity ensues. One poor bastard thought the Obama campaign actually wrote this: “DUDE, IT’S OBAMA HERE, I CHOO CHOO CHOOSE YOU TO BE MY VP, DAWG.” Contribute ›A quick look at the seven houses McCain owns. Contribute ›Style Buzz You can now get Keds imprinted with a design or photo of your choice. I’m currently scrolling through the Fail Blog to find an adequate photo for my new Zazzles! Contribute ›A collection of some of the most cringe worthy photo portraits from the 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s that amounts to 3 decades worth of pure awkwardness. Contribute ›Sports Buzz Each logo has a short description giving some needed context. Personal faves include 1908 London, 1964 Tokyo, and 1968 Mexico City, which totally blows my mind makes my eyes hurt at the same time. Contribute ›Politics Buzz The Italian edition of Vanity Fair says they found Barack Obama’s half brother living in a hut in a ramshackle town of Huruma on the outskirts of Nairobi. I would totally cry if they reunited on Oprah or something. Contribute ›TV Buzz The gold medalist has delivered NBC with some huge ratings, but he’s yet to trump The Golden Girls, which continues to hold the record for Saturday night numbers. People might like watching Michael Phelps in a Speedo, but nothing beats Bea Arthur in a mauve pleather pantsuit. There’s just no contest. Contribute ›Business Buzz Microsoft’s next ad campaign will feature Seinfeldian shtick. It’s the plight of the funnyman: Once the funny stops, there’s only advertising. Life seems more like Mad Men every day. Contribute ›Taking a break from the “Biggest Online Dance Battles In The History Of Man Kind”, Miley Cyrus urges America to “Wake Up” and go green! Contribute ›TV Buzz Henry Winkler helped unveil a statue of his legendary Happy Days character, “The Fonz,” in Milwaukee. The sitcom and its spin-off, Laverne and Shirley, were both set in Milwaukee, now officially “the coolest city ever” thanks to a certain bronzed leather jacket and pompadour. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Listen to the feed from her live microphone isolated during a live show. Wow, what a breathy mess. Can I get a ringtone made of this? Contribute ›Oh, it’s so cute when animals smooch! Contribute ›Business Buzz Certain styles of laptop bags are now allowed to go through security without being unsheathed. When you’re racing to catch your flight, every second at the security checkpoint counts. Knowing me, I’ll end up wearing some kind of crazy lace-up gladiator shoes that totally defeats the purpose. Contribute ›TV Buzz He’s the newest member of SNL, replacing Amy Poehler. Hmm. Replace the cute blond girl with the beardy chubby dude? I’m not sure how well that will bode for ratings, but UCB and underground comedy fans can attest to his funniness. Contribute ›Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
