Ain’t nothing wrong with a bikini, a beach, and a hot blond country star.Science Buzz A weird cluster of lightning-strike related news items on the web today. Be careful out there.

The toxic combination of hairspray, motor oil, and Aqua di Gio will be unavoidable when the album hits, so if you know what’s good for you (and your lungs), you’ll stay as far away from Long Island as possible. (Confession: Having grown up on Long Island, I can recite every lyric to “Scenes From An Italian Restaurant” verbatim. Can’t deny your roots, right?)Video footage of a drunken Belarusian soccer referee being helped off the field.Science Buzz Dede Koswara, a former Indonesian fisherman, has witnessed mysterious lesions and “root-like” growths surface all over his body as a result of — believe it or not — contracting an HPV infection.
