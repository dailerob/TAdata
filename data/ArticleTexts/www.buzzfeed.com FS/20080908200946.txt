Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Site uses facial recognition technology to tell you what celebrity you look most like. Just upload a photo and it will analyze your face and give you a list of celebrities that you resemble.

Contribute ›On last night’s VMA’s, Christina Aguilera “re-interpreted” her first smash, “Genie In A Bottle,” before introducing her new single, “Keeps Gettin’ Better.” Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz This years VMAs were (as usual) all about Britney Spears. After last year’s disaster, Britney redeemed herself by looking hot and winning Best Female, Best Pop, and Video of the Year for her video Piece of Me.

Contribute ›TV Buzz Forgetting anything they learned (or didn’t learn) about NBC’s quarterlife, ABC has given the green light to airing thirteen episodes of web series In The Motherhood, starring Leah Remini, Chelsea Handler, and Jenny McCarthy.
