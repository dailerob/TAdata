Both men owe their condition to taking colloidal silver, which allegedly offers certain health benefits but also has the unfortunate side effect of making you look like a freeze-dried blueberry.View the 11 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz Over 100 celebrities personalize lunchboxes and auction them off for charity. Awww, Natalie Portman loves her puffy paint. And Elton John is into gnomes.View the 6 Best LinksTech Buzz Are terrorists using virtual worlds as training grounds?
