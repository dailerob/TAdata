{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Lifestyle Buzz The Dove \"Real Beauty\" ads are experiencing a backlash. One was even banned by the FCC. Should marketing towards women induce self-loathing or self-lathering? Add some thigh-firming cream to the mix and it seems like feminism just gets more confusing every day. Here are some links to further convolute the debate.View the 17 Best LinksPolitical Buzz Scooter Libby found guilty on 4 out of 5 charges. Literary world, rejoice! Scooter Libby\u0027s debut novel really captured the eroticism of bear rape in an exquisite uncluttered prose. But now that he\u0027ll have a lot of prison time on his hands, we hope to get more literary jewels out of him, perhaps one detailing Cheney rape, Bush rape, prison rape, or if we\u0027re lucky: all three happening at the same time.View the 8 Best LinksFashion Buzz New York Magazine reports on a trend that women are using lip and cheek tints to make their nipples rosy. Are your nipples blushing or are you just ecstatic to see me?View the 4 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz Muji, the environmentally conscious Japanese home accessories store, will open its flagship in NYC. Normally we don\u0027t condone rampant consumerism, but in this case, we\u0027ll make an exception. No more IKEA bus!!!View the 9 Best LinksTech Buzz This electronic forum for people to post their unwanted items has been around since 2003, and membership is growing. Get your ass out of that dumpster! There are now other ways to give stuff away, and get free stuff in return (because that\u0027s how free market capitalism works, right?) Now, even freegans have their own social network.View the 12 Best LinksPolitical Buzz Check out this audio clip of Hillary Clinton speaking like a southern black preacher. When Hillary wanted to start a conversation with us, she didn\u0027t mention she\u0027d be speaking in an annoying fake southern black accent. Maybe we\u0027ll go compare summers abroad in France with Mitt Romney instead.View the 11 Best LinksTech Buzz The various diets of internet entrepreneurs, hackers, and geeks. (Thanks to Mark for the tip!) People are so concerned over the underweight models in the fashion industry, but no one seems to care about those spindly-thin hackers and UNIX geeks, wasting away in dark basements. You too can unencrypt their secret to weight loss, without taking a single computer science course (unless, of course, you need some thinspo).View the 8 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz Sudden increase in dog stealing in America and England. This is the kind of heartbreaking trend that pains us to report. But if you\u0027re Paris Hilton, you can actually view this as a cute-dog upgrade.View the 8 Best LinksPolitical Buzz Ann Coulter calls John Edwards a \"faggot,\" manages to turn conservatives against her. We didn\u0027t want to give Ann more publicity than she deserves. But then we found that picture with the adam\u0027s apple and it was all just too perfect, like puzzle pieces sent from God.View the 18 Best LinksTV Buzz Jack Black\u0027s new VH1 interactive user-controlled program. VH1 is watchable again! Is The Agency totally the best show or what?? It\u0027s like America\u0027s Next Top Model but not retarded. Anyway, this show is hosted by Jack Black, meaning it\u0027s kind of like the opposite of The Agency but in a good way. We\u0027re too lazy to actually \"interact\" with anything, but the show looks like good times.View the 7 Best LinksFashion Buzz Alison Kelly of Project Runway fame\u0027s new clothing line. Oh, we all want a little piece of Alison Kelly. The next best thing would be to own one of her cute flirty dresses, which are somewhat affordable (depending on how poor you are) from shopbop.com.View the 9 Best LinksPolitical Buzz Swiss Soldiers accidentally invade Liechtenstein during a routine training exercise. Leave it to those ditzy Swiss people to pull the ultimate \"tee-hee!\" This is perhaps the first time a military invasion made me stop and say, \"Awwww.\"View the 8 Best LinksArts/Culture Buzz Associated Press\u0027 week-long experimental ban on all Paris Hilton news was a journalistic feat. Hmm. We did this, too. For an entire DAY (February 27th, 2007, to be exact, if you wanted to be nitpicky and check the archives), we didn\u0027t cover a single trend on porn, Jews, Blacks, or Gays. The result? Devastatingly, suicidally low traffic. So yeah. Make sure to keep reading Buzzfeed if you love sex and/or racism.View the 7 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz The new exercise class that\u0027s pretty much freestyle dancing. It\u0027s the new Curves, but with fewer old fat housewives. Get hot and sweaty with your girlfriends to today\u0027s hits (the Knife, M.I.A., etc). The best part about it is that there\u0027s no need to get hussied up with your cleavage-baring tops and Laboutin heels to see who can pick up that hot boy across the room. The worst part about it is that there\u0027s no hot boy across the room to pick up.View the 9 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz \"That\u0027s so gay\" prompts student lawsuit. When I first saw this headline, I thought it was going to be an amazing new sitcom on ABC Family. Unfortunately, it is just a news story that everyone will probably forget in 2 hours.View the 11 Best LinksLooking for more?
