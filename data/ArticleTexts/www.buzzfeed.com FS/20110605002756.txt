In Plan of the City buildings transform into rocket ships and resettle on Mars. To tell this odd little story, the filmmakers combined animation, live action, illustration and photography, including images taken by the Mars Rovers. And the music? Well, I won\u0027t spoil everything. See for yourself. Watch Video ›Artist Bruno Catalano creates beautiful sculptures that appear to be floating. Amazing stuff, more of Bruno\u0027s work at his own site. View List ›The worst part of summer is upon us: Bikini Shopping. But not to fear because a \u0027How To\u0027 guide is here!

Then again, I\u0027m just an American, so what do I know? (Via) Watch Video ›These faux adverts for the fictional businesses of the Pixar universe are by Mario Graciotti. The series is entitled \u0027Pixar Establishments\u0027. If you enjoyed these, make sure to check out Graciotti\u0027s other art - he has an eye for tight colorful design.

Cute puppies work better than half-naked models, though. Maybe someone should clue them in on that. View List ›All movies try at some level to evoke emotion based on the story that is being told. I\u0027ve picked a few scenes that are notable for their ability to hit you in the gut, so to speak. I\u0027ve left out obvious classics and stuck to movies from the last two decades. But feel free to add your own! :D View List ›A “what if?” rendition of a few Marvel and DC superheroes, and a space princess. By Michael Dooney.

Also, you know what\u0027s better than sleepy rabbits in cups? Sleepy rabbits that have just been startled in cups. Everything is ten times cuter in a cup, after all. Watch Video ›Nice, but I wish they could have come up with a cheesier title for the song. It\u0027s almost like they\u0027re not even trying anymore. (Via Official Hype) Watch Video ›When Kate MacDowell hand-sculpts these porcelain pieces, what she\u0027s thinking about is the idealized notion of unity with the natural world and how it conflicts with our contemporary impact on the environment. Regardless of what that\u0027s supposed to mean, the end result is a fusion of delicate, cute, creepy, shocking and heart-breaking.

They are also pretty pricey, but that doesn’t mean we can’t appreciate how pretty they are. (Via The Uniblog) View List ›I\u0027m guessing this took a long time to make.
