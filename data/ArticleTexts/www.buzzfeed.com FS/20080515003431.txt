{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"TV Buzz What the BBC would look like if there was no news. Two different takes on what would happen if the news cycle just plain stopped.Celebrity Buzz Jessica takes part in an online staring contest in order to promote Cash Warren’s new social networking site.

The game does a better job of explaining it that I can — basically, your robot character has a TARDIS that lets you meet up with past versions of yourself to work together.

New Yorkers wonder: Will it land in Williamsburg? Some people seem bothered, but then most of the hipsters in Williamsburg already star in a reality show in their heads, so things wouldn’t really change that much.Music Buzz The boy-girl self-described “fantasy rock” duo is quietly making a name for themselves on the East Coast as they continue to draw comparisons to Postal Service and Broken Social Scene. Alongside labelmates MGMT, Savoir Adore is continuing in Brooklyn’s tireless fight to conquer the iTunes library of the skinny-jeans-and-bedhead set.Culture Buzz A Flickr photoset juxtaposing screens from GTA IV’s Liberty city with shots of New York City includes many accurate and crazy details.
