{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Science Buzz Herdsmen in Kenya are trying to stop their goats from mating because of drought. The solution? Goat condoms of course. The “olor” is made from cowhide or a square piece of plastic, and is tied around the belly of the male goat. It prevents them from mating (having sex) with female goats. I also included a link to a website for dog condoms. WTF.1 Response · Add Yours ›http://gawker.com/5059535/jim-cramer-begs-...Talk about a downer.
