{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Style Buzz The PetPocket Bird Carrier is a birdcage you can wear on your back. Why bother putting feathers in your hair when you can just tote around the whole bird. This conversation starting accessory is way better than carrying around a ferret.Culture Buzz New York Based photographer Todd Selby has created a website featuring photos of various artists, writers and musicians in their homes. Like an uber-hip version of Cribs these photos have me indulging in the best kind of voyeurism. The subjects of the photo essays include white-suited legend Tom Wolfe, Vice magazine diarist Lesley Arfin and foxy video director Georgie Greyville.Culture Buzz Policemen in Australia freak out over a Reborn baby doll sitting in a car, attesting to just how realistic looking they are. Babies - they are truly what nightmares are made of. These dolls even appear to be breathing and have beating hearts! If I had one of these in my house, I’d be scared it would eat my brains in my sleep.A plastic surgery disaster in the making coupled with steroid abuse, Carrot Top looks like a hot tranny mess.The first trailer for the movie that’s being touted as “the smartest, most subversive superhero story ever created” was released today.Sports Buzz The new fitness/sports craze involves a pogo stick that lets you make six-foot jump. They cost around $250. From the videos, it looks totally terrifying so hopefully you have a good medical plan as well, with low deductibles.President Bush surveys the consequences of the worst disaster we’ve seen throughout the eight years of Bush’s presidency: Bush’s presidency.Music Buzz New York musician Thomas Bartlett covers the soundtrack to Footloose (yes, Kenny Loggins, Kevin Bacon, dance laws, etc.) in a moving tribute to his friend’s half-sister, who passed away as a teenager. The unusual circumstances naturally make for an unusual - albeit stunning - record. Problem is, the mp3’s are ridiculously hard to find now that Doveman received a cease-and-desist letter after initially posting the album on his site for free. If you know where to find the tracks, let me know and I’ll post it. (Update: GOT IT!)TV Buzz The host of a show on Air America filled in for Keith Olbermann and might be getting her own show on MSNBC. I have a total girl-on-girl crush on Rachel Maddow. Judging by the positive press she’s getting, she might be the new Michael Cera.Photographs of trees that look oddly sexual.Culture Buzz Listen up, ladies! Now you can turn back time (well, if only for your V) with this ultra-creepy “tightening lubricant.” It does exactly what you think it does. That sound you hear is the collective slamming of SUV driver’s-side doors as wannabe-MILF’s race to the finish to see who can find Liquid Virgin first. Alas, it’s only available on teh netz. (Thanks for the tip, Sara!)A simple plea to car thieves.Food Buzz The FDA announces the Great Tomato Scare of Aught Eight is finally over. Thank god we all survived! For a while there, we couldn’t even get beefsteak tomatoes on our pizza. Now the FDA is saying tomatoes might never have been the source of the outbreak to begin with. Watch out for those peppers, though!Creepy and fascinating, the goop takes on a life of its own over a vibrating subwoofer.Culture Buzz Disney’s first film to feature an African-American princess has already caused a considerable amount of controversy. Disney, a company with a considerable legacy of racism, scrapped the original treatment which centered on a chambermaid named Maddy working for a spoiled Southern debutante criticism that the storyline reinforced negative stereotypes. The film will now be called The Princess and the Frog and the lead character will be a girl named Tiana living in New Orleans during the jazz age.Style Buzz The porn-lite ads for Dov Charney’s fashion regime lend themselves naturally to being mocked. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but these don’t look too sincere.Warner Bros. is releasing the trailer for the next Terminator installment, starring Christian Bale, just in time to capitalize on the country’s “Dark Knight” fever.Movie Buzz Tugg Speedman, Ben Stiller’s character in the upcoming comedy Tropic Thunder, now has an official website that brazenly parodies Tom Cruise’s. Far from subtle, the site is formatted almost exactly like Cruise’s and boasts a similarly affected fan address and dramatic pose. This isn’t the first time Stiller has poked fun at Cruise. Check out the YouTube vid Tom Crooze.Twins born to a mixed-race couple in Germany have two different skin colors.Britney who? TMZ is on the cusp of celebrity candids with these completely unnecessary pictures of sad-looking old man Peter Falk.Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
