{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The Daily Mail reports on a very, very crowded swimming pool in China.Culture Buzz Not all rabbis agree, but more and more Jews are shrugging off the taboos around tattoos. The Torah may or may not prohibit tattoos, but the urban myth about not being able to be buried in a Jewish cemetery if you’re tattooed is just that. Like most things, there’s a growing community online of Jews who tattoo.Rehabilitating baby sea lions has to be one of the best jobs in the world, at least based on this video.Food Buzz Chances are, you don’t have enough raspberry in your life. Here’s how to get more. It’s raspberry season, people, and it’s time to get beyond just tossing a handful over your cereal in the morning.Someone’s gone and made video versions of Girl Talk’s album, Feed the Animals. They’re all on YouTube.Culture Buzz Now you can create an action figure version of yourself. Be A Doll will create a custom doll from a photo, then dress it in the outfit you choose all for $165. Totally creepy and yet so awesome. I’m hoping I can get mine with light-up earrings like Jem.It appears that Sarah Jessica Parker may have had that big ole’ chin mole surgically removed.Andy Dick gets busted for groping a 17-year-old girl, subsequently takes this creepy mug shot.Style Buzz The 90s grunge revival is spawning an odd floral overload, reminiscent of Mayim Bialik from Blossom. Well, I’m definitely more of a Clarissa girl, but watching the Blossom theme song just made me feel really nostalgic. Not nostalgic enough to go out and buy a hat with a giant fake daisy on it, however.Tech Buzz The classic arcade game you can now play in a tiny favicon. Not recommended for people with bad vision or who hate staring at small spaceships as they attack a city. For the rest of us though, this is actually a fun little game.There are only about 200 white lions in the world, and seven of them were just born at the end of June in a German safari park.Celebrity Buzz First Marla Maples, now Helen Mirren. These grand dames look damn grand. Okay, so Marla Maples isn’t very old. Still, is it wrong to champion the idea that women’s bodies can be beautiful no matter what their age?Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” dubbed over an “8 Minute Abs” workout.Tech Buzz Our favorite iPhone app: using the phone’s mic, Shazam can listen to any song and tell you what it is. How many times have you been in the Gap and wondered, “What’s that awesome song they’re playing in here?” Wonder no more! With the magic of Shazam, you’ll never be left out of the game again. Just hold your phone up to the music for a few seconds and it will name that tune.Politics Buzz Kevin Powell, former cast member ofThe Real World’s first season, is running for Congress in NY’s 10th district, aka Brooklyn. Powell’s credentials (Real World alum, Vibe Magazine scribe, Hurricane Katrina cleaner-upper, and BA in Political Science) don’t exactly give Ed Towns, the 13-term incumbent, a run for his money. Powell believes “civic engagement should be a part of our values as much as MTV and Xbox”, and has posted a mix-tape online that mashes excerpts from his speeches against tunes by Tupac, Kanye West and 50 Cent. Not sure if I will vote for Powell, but all the power to him for trying to get young people involved in public service and politics.Culture Buzz A new memoir, from New York Times columnist David Carr, is sort of the anti-made-up bestseller. Carr’s retelling of his long struggle with drugs is buttressed by serious reporting, not just his own recollections — interviews and documents support his investigation into his addiction, the birth of his twins, his struggle with cancer and his eventual return to the working world.Tech Buzz Julia Allison’s NonSociety project has inspired a wide variety of satire. The launch of the project — timed perfectly with Allison’s appearance on the cover of Wired — has stirred up the inevitable backlash from bloggers, who’re already tired of Allison’s particularly noxious strain of ubiquity (of course, they could always just not look).Alex Sandwell Kliszynski has done a series of NSFW photographs of human barbie dolls.The NY Times published a chart that shows how people are using their unlimited Metrocards.Culture Buzz Flowcharts, once relegated to computer science classes and tedious brainstorming meetings, are now being used for FUN and FUNNY purposes. Pretty much all of life can be dumbed down to a schematic representation of an algorithm or process. It’s why God’s universe is so amazing.Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
