{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Pamela Anderson shows up at London Fashion Week with a ghastly date. Contribute ›Janey talks to her pony friends and formulates a plan to get back at her classmate Tracey Stacy Esposito. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games takes place in a futuristic dystopian society where teens fight to the death in front of live TV audiences. Much like The Running Man, Survivor, and Battle Royale, The Hunger Games shines another spotlight on humanity’s obsession with devouring one another alive while the television cameras roll. Contribute ›Movie Buzz Meet Rusco, the dog who plays Papi in the upcoming Disney smash-your-face hit Beverly Hills Chihuahua. He was rescued from an animal shelter just days before he was to be, er, let go. On an interesting side note, Rusco was trained by the same Animal Trainer who made the Squirrels go crazy in the modern Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory! He’s in safe hands.

Manhunt will reunite Simon with Tom Fontana, the guy behind Oz who also originally adapted Simon’s Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets for TV. In other words: Good times. Contribute ›A photo was taken of P Diddy stepping in dogshit. Contribute ›Movie Buzz Netflix is hosting a grueling public movie-watching marathon beginning October 2nd in New York’s Times Square and is expected to last until a new Guinness World Record is achieved (56 movies).

Contribute ›http://www.dipity.com/user/tatercakes...Someone has developed a wiki-timeline of Internet memes. It’s the geekiest, and awesomest, thing ever. Contribute ›http://thingswithapproximatelyasmanyp...A blog that lists things with with approximately 6,000 people, which was the population of Wasilla, Alaska while Sarah Palin was mayor. Contribute ›Tech Buzz This is no joke. There’s a whole community of so-called “Office Walkers” that set their computers up on treadmills so they never stop walking while at work. Ever! Doesn’t this take away from the whole benefit of being a cubicle slave? I value my time spent at my desk, where the only exercise I get is a few chair spins a day accompanied by a gleeful “Wheeeeee!”. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Twitter accepts alternate characters and symbols, and here’s a handy bookmarklet to access them easily.

Contribute ›Movie Buzz Hollywood’s conservatives have come together to make a comedy/parody about Michael Moore and the liberal elite. In theaters October 3rd. If this is anything like the Fox News’ Half-Hour News Hour, it’s sure to be filled with lots of kneeslappers and wisecracks. Contribute ›Food Buzz A restaurant owner in Switzerland has announced he will be serving “various soups and sauces containing at least 75 per cent of mother’s milk”. The dude’s apparently been “experimenting” with breast milk since his daughter was born, trying it out in all sorts of devilish dinner plates and appetizers. Lets not have Morimoto get any big ideas, or this will be the special ingredient on Iron Chef, leaving us all to stick to the salad, please, on our nights out.
