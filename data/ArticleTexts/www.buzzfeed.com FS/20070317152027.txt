{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tech Buzz A list of 10 video games with cultural and historical significance is drawn up and everyone else in the world lodges their complaints. No Pong? No Pac-Man? Why Super Mario 3 and not the original? Where the F is Zelda? So many questions to answer in solving this pressing first-world problem.View the 11 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz Couples are engaging in Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell relationships in which both people can pursue late night nookie and drunken hookups with others as long as they don\u0027t tell their partner about it. But reports indicate that only 2.8% of all American males are mature and self-confident enough to handle such an arrangement for more than an evening. Better think up a Plan B, Romeo.View the 8 Best LinksMovie Buzz While Hollywood boo-hoo-hoos about piracy and the internet killing their business, 2007 is shaping up to be a pretty good year for getting asses in theater seats. 300 and Ghost Rider both did surprising business at the box office (which bodes well for the huge summer blockbusters like Spidey, Potter, and Pirates) and Zodiac is getting early Oscar buzz.View the 10 Best LinksFood Buzz Each year, Coca-Cola makes Coke with sugar for observant US Jews to drink during Passover. And the rest of us get to go along for the ride. This is a boon for those who don\u0027t like Coke with high fructose corn syrup and who have to seek out the superior sugared Coke in small Mexican restaurants and grocery stores.View the 10 Best LinksSports Buzz With the NCAA Tournament coming up, everyone from scientists to literary types has improvised some sort of tournament. Everything is a zero-sum game these days but bracket fever seems to have gotten a boost this year from the publication of The Enlightened Bracketologist: The Final Four of Everything. Adjudication was never so much fun.View the 17 Best LinksFashion Buzz From Urban Outfitters to Steven Alan, they\u0027re everywhere. Thanks to SeamSters.net for bringing the bunchy panties phenomenon to light. It is definitely something we noticed, cough cough, not that we shop at Urban Outfitters or anything.View the 5 Best LinksScience Buzz NASA captures a scintillating video of the moon transiting the sun. An amazing video. Also, an amazing name for a jam band. We\u0027re totally changing the name of ours from Space Diapers to Stereo Eclipse.View the 7 Best LinksFashion Buzz Buzzy Brazilian designer Alexandre Herchcovitch\u0027s new collection is all about Orthodox Jewish fashion. Yep. Pretty much the only logical progression of hipster streetwear from the taliban scarf.View the 4 Best LinksTV Buzz New dramedy series on FX about Irish gypsies. We\u0027re a little late on this one, seeing as that it premiered last night, but praise for the pilot has been so overwhelmingly positive. If you missed it, it\u0027s available on Yahoo TV. Apparently the creators knew it would be your new favorite thing, because they\u0027ve developed a fan podcast for you to go and profess your undying love for Minnie Driver.View the 8 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz Mayan leaders say they will \"spiritually cleanse\" an ancient site President Bush and the First Lady will visit during their current trip through South America. Indigenous peoples are a little prone to overreacting. But we did hear that rubbing crystals on your forehead will prevent the transmission of genital herpes.View the 7 Best LinksBusiness Buzz Secret cabal set up by The Economist who wants your ideas. This tastes less like Jamaica and more like exploitation! I mean, if we really had an amazing online idea, wouldn\u0027t we be doing it ourselves?View the 7 Best LinksArts/Culture Buzz Andrew WK reinvents himself as a motivational speaker, comedian. His music always kind of sucked, but ever since seeing him on various specials on MTV (you can watch clips from his short-lived show, Your Friend, Andrew WK on YouTube), it was evident that he has a genuine awesomeness so rarely found amongst people who make terrible music. A cult leader for the hipster set? We wouldn\u0027t rule it out....View the 10 Best LinksPolitical Buzz Candidates are citing \"scheduling conflicts\" and overall general offensiveness of Fox News as reasons why they won\u0027t participate. All the candidates are too cool and may or may not show up to some lame debate where there\u0027s not even a celebrity DJ or ample amounts of designer drugs. John Edwards is pretty much the Cory Kennedy of the political scene.View the 11 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz A hotel in San Francisco is offering a luxurious \"Britney Breakdown Package,\" comes with a trip to the hair salon, a thong, and a $25 gift certificate to H\u0026M. The only problem we see with this is that Britney doesn\u0027t shop at H\u0026M, she shops at Strawberry. Other than that, the hotel\u0027s many amenities should keep your suicidal tendencies from spiraling out of control.View the 6 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz Islamic militants are forcing French Jews to flee into South Florida.
