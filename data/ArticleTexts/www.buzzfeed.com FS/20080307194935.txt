Stefan Nadelman\u0027s film Food Fight starts with World World II and reenacts all the major armed conflicts since using the typical foods of each country as the players. It\u0027s hard not to cry when the giant hamburger cloud annihilates the sushi, and that\u0027s just the beginning.View the 7 Best LinksFood Buzz The Jewish community is torn over whether a kosher cheeseburger being served at a NYC restaurant should be considered sacrilegious.
