Thanks to Flickr’s geotagging abilities, you never need idly wonder where the nearest cat can be found. Contribute ›There’s no better way to say “I love you” than a Netflix heart. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz West was arrested at LAX for “felony vandalism” after grabbing a paparazzo’s camera out of his hand and smashing it on the ground. Do not make Kanye angry. You will not like him when he’s angry. Contribute ›Frozen genitalia from the ice floes of Antarctica. Contribute ›Culture Buzz “Hello my dear students.” Marina Orlova is a Russian Philologist (one who studies linguistics and etymology) who discusses the origins of English words on her website and corresponding Youtube Channel, Hot For Words. With over 100 million video views and the title of Sexiest Geek of the Year, Marina proves that you can be sexy and smart (if you consider being able to trace the origin of the word “Boobs” smart.) Contribute ›We’ve all been there. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Test your knowledge of internet logos. This is surprisingly hard. And no, BuzzFeed’s logo isn’t in there. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz The fashion designer and star of The Hills has signed a three-book deal with Harper Collins, where her first publication will be a semi-autobiographical novel called L.A. Candy due for release next summer. Note to aspiring authors: if you’re wealthy, attractive, and willing to have every aspect of your life executive-produced, you too can achieve the dream! Contribute ›Music Buzz After her first album initially tanked, Beyonce’s li’l sis continues to try and shake off the inevitable comparison by releasing a vintage-sounding record with top-notch producers like Raphael Saadiq, Mark Ronson, and Pharrell Williams, although the response has been tepid (to say the least). While the music on the album is hella fun, it’s not hard to recognize the record’s sole weakness being Solange’s lack of vocal prowess (or the charisma of someone like…well, Beyonce). Contribute ›Politics Buzz Funny or Die has a video of Gina Gershon playing Sarah Palin, answering her critics on all the tough issues. Ugh! Now you’re sort of forced to think Sarah Palin is hot. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Someone decided to compile a collection of photos of brides in their underwear (both inadvertent and posed). Wedding day underwear - almost as important as the dress, in most cases. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Everyone hates the mandatory new Facebook design. Did someone just reformulate your heroin? It might be time to re-remember that old MySpace password. Contribute ›A melted sign in England reminds us of why we’re pretty psyched for colder weather. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Let’s look at goofy photos of celebs who used to have braces so we can laugh at them and feel better about ourselves. Even beautiful, famous people had awkward phases! The only difference between us and them is that they actually grew out of them…. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Ashton Kutcher started a bloggy web project that puts a “teen twist” (read: satirical spin) on celebrity culture. Kutcher is an actor, producer, model, and now an official tech darling. Is there anything this man can’t do or are we just being Punk’d into believing that there’s more to this guy than foppish good looks and a hot ball ‘n chain? Contribute ›Tech Buzz A curious little Flash game that mixes Erik Sate-like music with visuals out of a Miyazaki film. It’s not easy to play (even escaping the orbit of the first planet proved tricky), but it does feel like entering another world.
