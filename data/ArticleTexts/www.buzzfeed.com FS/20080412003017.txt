Even Gawker, the foremost authority on How To Publicly Belittle Media Figures, can\u0027t help but obsess over her every move, pose, or post (and they arguably made her career in the first place). Love her or hate her, a profile in The New York Times (not to mention the Guardian)can never hurt someone whose livelihood depends on coverage.View the 17 Best LinksCulture Buzz A group of 26 bearded men are suddenly everyone\u0027s favorite font.

With John Hughes\u0027 name popping up lately in association with Drillbit Taylor (it seems he cowrote the film under the psuedonym Edmond Dantes), we\u0027ve been asking ourselves why this guy pulled a J.D. Salinger and quit while he was ahead. In retrospect even his relative failures, like Curly Sue and She\u0027s Having a Baby seem pretty good.View the 7 Best LinksFood Buzz The NY Times reports on popular new cocktails that feature eggs as an ingredient.
