{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"OMG!! He looks like a puffed up pig!!! Cute!!!SPIKEY’S NEVER LOOKED SO CUTE!!!!!I DARE YOU TO FIND SOMETHING CUTER TODAY.Tech Buzz Apple’s new Exchange-like service is being made fun of for the bad design of its logo (read: for copying from Microsoft). There is a clear similarity between Moblie Me and Windows ME, and the comparison flatters no one.One very big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical about cats with personalities living among junkyard squalor leads you on a tour of her feline-friendly closet.A pig in England wears wee wellies because she’s afraid of mud.Business Buzz Parties where pretty fashionable girls can go to meet the i-banker of their dreams. Let’s face it: if you work in fashion, you probably make next to nothing, and certainly not enough to afford all that nice clothes you’re around all the time. Boyfriend in a band or new Louis Vuitton bag? It’s your choice.Politics Buzz Just as JFK had Marilyn Monroe, Barack Obama has a slew of celebrity supporters. Hollywood’s Team Obama already includes Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, and Samuel L. Jackson — and the list only seems to be growing.Music Buzz From floppy drives to modern HDDs, re-purposing disk drives to play music. As seen in that Radiohead video from last week, older hard drives and floppies can find new life as lo-fi speakers.Celebrity Buzz The 18-year-old country star is hoping not to become a tabloid fixture. With a cameo in the Hannah Montana movie and her own clothing line (not to mention her triple platinum debut album), she’s taken a few important steps towards becoming next year’s Miley Cyrus, minus the leaked internet photo scandals.Celebrity Buzz The legendary 83-year-old actor is reportedly “very ill” with terminal lung cancer. Impossibly perfect, Newman is both an accomplished actor and active philanthropist whose [awesome] salad dressings have raised over $100M for charity.Culture Buzz A futuristic British sex toy made of squishy plastic is revolutionizing the way women masturbate. Instead of the Bone Zone, take it to the Cone Zone. You can even leave it out as a non-phallic, non-pervy decoration for your mantle.This video starring Nathan Lane and the men from the Broadway show Xanadu has almost half a million views. Gay it up!Politics Buzz Or PUMA, for short. The name of the group of Hillary supporters who refuse to support Obama, and will be protesting the 2008 election. They even have their own fund-raising committee, but honestly, wouldn’t the money be more effective if it just went directly to John McCain?TV Buzz Brody Jenner — son of old lesbian Bruce, stepbrother to porn famous Kim Kardashian, and ex-boyfriend of The Hills star Lauren “I Design Stuff” Conrad — has inked a deal with Ryan Seacrest’s production company to host a reality show in which “bros” will compete to earn the spot in his posse once occupied by the infamous Spencer Pratt. Contestants will live in a bachelor pad together while vying to “prove their worth as wingmen” and “remain composed in the thick of the paparazzi,” all before possibly being sent home in an elimination ceremony that takes place — no joke — in a hot tub. Don’t call Brody gay, though. He may have shapely eyebrows and surround himself in a jacuzzi with half-naked dudes, but it’s all in the name of turning “appearing on reality shows” into a discernible talent.Food Buzz Sixteen states have reported salmonella poisoning as the result of raw, uncooked tomatoes. If terrorists have been scheming up a way to immobilize all of America’s old Italian ladies, this might just be their 9-11.Celebrity Buzz Two of Bill Clinton’s alleged exes have gotten together and are offering up new thoughts on the former president for $1.99 a pop. It’s just nice to see older people using the internet to make money!The movie featuring a painful Brittany Snow ballbusting move will make you cringe.Science Buzz Videos about bananas and peanut butter are the “atheist’s nightmare” because they prove that god exists and evolution is a myth. These videos are hot on YouTube right now but the argument originally comes from Medieval Philosopher St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas’ “5th way of proving god” was to point to all the amazing things in nature and say that only god could have made them happen. Personally, I am outraged that some schools in America refuse to teach Medieval science.Graph of the world’s water supply.Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
