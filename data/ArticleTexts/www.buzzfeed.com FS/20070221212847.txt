Here\u0027s the quote from Rodriguez: \"You go from sleeping over at somebody\u0027s house five days a week, and now you don\u0027t sleep over.\" BTW, we only report sports buzz with homoerotic undertones.View the 9 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz In the international breast race, England is winning, with a whopping 57% of their women sporting D cups. This should certainly help out the British tourism bureau. Lucky Brits have more to celebrate today than just pancakes.View the 7 Best LinksScience Buzz When people who are related are attracted to one another. Hot incest trend! Perhaps it all started when we found out Rudy Giuliani married his cousin. It\u0027s a creepier form of narcissism, in a way.View the 6 Best LinksArts/Culture Buzz DVD compilation of shorts, documentaries, and cartoons from McSweeney\u0027s. We only read gossip rags, the New Yorker, and the occasional young adult novel, but it\u0027s always kind of impossible to pass by the latest issue of McSweeney\u0027s at the bookstore for purely aesthetic reasons. Anyway, here\u0027s the film version, already in its third installment, and it\u0027s a total bargain for you culture-hungry cheapskates.View the 7 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz Let\u0027s round up some celebrity nosepicking photos.

Black people seem to be displacing white people all over the place (presidential races, indie rock). And now the new rave. They definitely look much better in neon clothing than pasty white kids.View the 4 Best LinksPolitical Buzz The Examiner publishes an article fantasizing about Bill serving out the rest of Hillary\u0027s Senate term if Hillary becomes President. Stranger things have happened.View the 8 Best LinksTV Buzz Rob Corddry plays a 32-year-old virgin in a new Fox sitcom premiering March 4th. Watch the first four episodes. You might be lamenting the lack of Rob on the Daily Show but his own show will more than make up for it. It\u0027s appalling that there aren\u0027t more Rob Corddry fansites (or any, for that matter).View the 7 Best LinksArts/Culture Buzz The word \"scrotum\" appears in award-winning children\u0027s book; outrage ensues. Those gay penguins are looking really innocent right about now. Always remember: one scrotum in the library is worth two in the hand.View the 14 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz 9 people shot in the span of 7 hours. Mardi Gras isn\u0027t getting off to a very promising start. Hopefully the topless women on balconies will be able to cheer everyone up.View the 7 Best LinksArts/Culture Buzz Crazy condominium architecture for the elderly prevents them from becoming senile. (Only in Japan, of course.) These condos keep old people on their toes, with its sloped floors and obstacle-course hallways.

With Peel, you can discover new music without skimming a single post. We kind of actually miss the days when it took effort to find out about new bands (remember the excitement of a new Touch \u0026 Go mailorder catalog?), it felt more special that way.View the 7 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz Hot YouTube videos today include Nora, the piano-playing cat. Move over, Glenn Branca. The latest in avant-garde composition: cats playing the piano.View the 7 Best LinksTV Buzz Musical comedy duo from New Zealand will be filming a 12-part series for HBO.
