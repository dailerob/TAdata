{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Culture Buzz Two young New Jersey men were arrested after cops discovered them dressed as Ninjas donning swords, knives, and ninja stars with a plan to scare off local drug dealers. We all know the war on drugs isn’t going as planned, but unleashing a clan of Ninjas from Jersey isn’t necessarily the best alternative. These guys are lucky they got arrested before they tried to take on a bunch of gun wielding drug dealers with smoke bombs and back flips. Contribute ›Politics Buzz Barack Obama named Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as his vice presidential running mate early this morning. Will having an old white guy on the ticket help him reel in the votes from closeted racist white voters? Contribute ›Science Buzz A baby whale that had been abandoned by its mother off the coast of Australia was euthanized after veterinarians determined it would not survive on its own. The poor little thing bonded with a yacht thinking it was his mother and tried to suckle from it. The whale was only two or three weeks old, hadn’t eaten for a week and had been bitten by sharks. The move to euthanize him has caused considerable controversy and animal lovers everywhere are mourning the loss of the whale nicknamed “Colin”. Contribute ›Sports Buzz Gymnasts take over the gentleman’s club sport and turn it into an international competition. Pole dancers want your respect! Some of them straddle even better than Olympic gymnasts. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Align the 3D pixles to create a 2D image. The name sounds like the title of the next 007 flick, but it’s actually just a visually-challenging Flash game. Easier to link to than explain, so just click through. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz The Superbad redhead is in two movies at once (The crazy-fun House Bunny and the crazy-weird The Rocker) and is being touted as the next pretty/funny lady to watch. She will also play “The Ghost of Girlfriends Past” in a movie of the same name with Matthew McConaughey next year. It’s really true: he gets older, the ingenues stay the same age. Contribute ›Some very, very gross pictures of successful face transplants. (Careful! Did I mention these are gross?) Contribute ›Culture Buzz Small loopholes in the early copyrights for Mickey Mouse may release the cartoon character to the public domain this year. Some 1920s lawyer is really kicking himself. Most likely, Disney will go crazy on people’s asses and take back the mouse—but can’t we all dream of a world in which we could produce Mickey’s likeness without punishment? Utopia! Contribute ›Site unnecessarily blurs parts of a picture to make it seem worse than it actually is. Contribute ›Culture Buzz A blog by a 23-year-old, chronicling her abortion. She maintains the site’s not a fake, but came out of a need to document what’s happening, and also because Googling the phrase “abortion blog” resulted in sites that gave her nightmares. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Intel showed off a wireless electric power system developed by MIT. First USB 3.0 and now wireless power? Intel is poised for world domination. Contribute ›Food Buzz Expanding its reach outside of energy drinks for the first time, Red Bull releases a cola. From Red Bull, makers of one of the scariest chemicals created in the last couple of decades, comes an all-natural cola, made with coca leaf, kola nuts, ginger, mustard seeds and more. Contribute ›Food Buzz A refillable jug for carrying fresh beer home from the local brewery is a way to buy cheap beer without the wasteful packaging. There’s something so old-fashioned and quaint about the idea of carrying home some artisanal beer in a big jug. It’s like something Hansel and Gretel would do if they were wastoids. Contribute ›Sports Buzz The “Redeem Team” took care of business today in today’s semi-final game vs. Argentina. Team USA beat the team that kept them from winning the 2004 gold. It wasn’t always pretty (a big lead was cut to six at one point), but a victory nonetheless against the most difficult challenger in the tourney. Still one more victory for their first gold in a major international tournament since 2000. They recently beat Spain by 37, so it’s lookin’ good. Contribute ›Sports Buzz Michael Phelps was spotted in Beijing making out with Australian swimming sensation Stephanie Rice. While Phelps is bringing home the golds for the US, he’s going down under with the 20-year old brunette. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Lists of the things people own less than seven items of. After yesterday’s news about McCain being unsure of how many houses he owns (answer: 7), the blog Cajun Boy in the City was full of questions: “All of this got me to thinking…what do I own seven of? Truthfully, not much. Which then got me to thinking about how John McCain has more houses than I have a shitload of other things.” Contribute ›Sports Buzz The Times UK has an article about all the hooking up that went on at the Olympics. Sex is apparently it’s own separate event at the Olympics. Contribute ›Music Buzz A chart which displays the body parts we sing about per genre. Not surprisingly, hip-hop’s leader is “ass”, which is in 23.6% of sampled songs. Gospel and Hip-Hop both sing about “knees” 3% of the time, while everyone else seems to love “eyes” and “hands”. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Here are some mesmerizing wacky animated GIFs. I can’t stop staring! These GIFs make me feel like I’m on drugs. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Photo art made from nothing more than everyday smoke. No one’s ever been a big fan of smoke in general, but with the right lighting and a little help from Photoshop, it’s making a huge comeback.
