(Thanks for the tip!)View the 5 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz The worlds of fashion and music collide again as the supermodel says she\u0027s engaged...to Pete Doherty. Irina - who you may remember from those Topshop ads - didn\u0027t actually confirm who she\u0027s engaged to, but she and Doherty have been seeing a lot of each other recently. Adding to the scandal: Irina used to be BFF with Doherty\u0027s ex, Kate \"Cocaine Nose\" Moss. Fun times!View the 7 Best LinksCulture Buzz Alyssa Milano makes her blogging debut on the Huffington Post with a piece about neglected tropical diseases. The last thing we heard from Alyssa was that she was done dating baseball players. So needless to say, we were surprised to see her show up on the Huffington Post of all places, blogging about one of the most common afflictions of the world\u0027s poorest people.View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz Two dedicated urban cults of transportation square off. In the one corner, we have the longboard: The over-sized skateboard favored by surfers, frattish-types and \"edgy\" i-bankers. In the other, the fixed-gear bike: The obsessively minimalist bike that is the standard steed of the urban hipster. One involves pedaling, one involves pushing, both are hard to bring to a stop. Who. Will. Win?View the 10 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Nancy Pelosi Appears on the View, but it\u0027s her husband who steals the show. What a dreamboat! And a beacon of charisma.

Are fake Craigslist ads still funny? We suppose they provide fun side entertainment while cruising around for a couch, or a girlfriend.View the 15 Best LinksTech Buzz The latest mobile phone from Verizon is getting a ton of buzz. It\u0027s the latest hopeful in the \"iPhone killer\" category, sporting both an Apple-esque touchscreen and a full QWERTY keyboard.View the 5 Best LinksStyle Buzz Stealing clothing and accessory items is very in this fall. There have been a rash of fashion-related burglaries in the news recently. When handbags start going for upwards of $10,000 dollars, it only makes sense that high fashion would start being targeted by bandits.View the 6 Best LinksStyle Buzz A hoodie made of velcro strips is supposed to be a medium of conversation for bored and lonely people. \"I\u0027m lonely. Will you put on this hoodie so I can velcro myself to you and pretend you\u0027re my friend?\" It\u0027s pretty much foolproof.View the 3 Best LinksTech Buzz A 4mm-thick phone comes to you through the mail. The flatness of this phone is cool, though we don\u0027t really get why you\u0027d be sending your landline through the mail. Next we\u0027d like to see phones delivered by carrier pigeon.View the 5 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Rush Limbaugh referred to soldiers who were calling for withdrawal from Iraq as \"phony soldiers.\" We were doing a good job of ignoring him, but now the Democrats are demanding an apology, while a coalition of anti-war veterans are pretty angry.View the 12 Best LinksSports Buzz A boomerang for your dog.

Since we\u0027re big fans of Wired Science in blog format, we\u0027re pretty excited about this. It does, however, conflict time-wise with America\u0027s Next Top Model. Hmm.View the 5 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz The rumored sex tape turns out to be just a short comedy video on FunnyOrDie.com. It is Eva Longoria, but she\u0027s just horsing around in night-vision with comedian Eric Christian Olsen. This is part of the larger trend of dumb fake celebrity sex tapes, like that weird Dane Cook/Jessica Alba nightmare.View the 6 Best LinksStyle Buzz How to get those big crazy George-Washington style coifs you saw on the runways. The best part about this hairstyle is that it actually works better on unwashed hair, meaning you can kill two hair trends in one week: the alt-90s greasy grunge look and then the sexy Bride of Frankenstein rat\u0027s nest. We find both to be equally (unequally?) flattering.View the 5 Best LinksScience Buzz Latest research suggests more options for male birth control.

Oh wait....View the 10 Best LinksTV Buzz TV sitcom on the CW about a conservative Midwestern family who takes in a Pakistani exchange student, laughs ensue. Premieres tonight.
