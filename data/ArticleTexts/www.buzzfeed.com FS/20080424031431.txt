{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tech Buzz We’ve redesigned. But there’s more to come! Hope you like the new look (props to our designer, Chris, and Mark and Eric on the development side), but we’ll also be rolling out some new features in the months to come that will bring you buzz in all sorts of new ways. You can sign up now to get info about our new publishing platform.Celebrity Buzz Short clip-on hair extensions simulating bangs have been seen on celebs like Rihanna, Vanessa Hudgens, and Britney Spears (a good example of how not to wear them). Now you no longer have to feel pangs of sadness and envy every time you see a photo of Irina Lazareanu. Now if only there was a way to test-drive a bowl-cut….Tech Buzz Designer Erik De Nijs has created pair of pants with a built in keyboard and mouse. The nerd blogs are atwitter with criticisms, suggesting all sorts of naughty applications for the “Beauty and the Geek” pants. I’m willing to wager that they are actually some conceptual artistic statement on how humans are becoming one with their gadgets.Business Buzz Hotels abandoned before completion have an eerie presence. From Disney World to the sands of the Sinai, luxury hotels have become modern ruins when financing dries up. Here’s some spooky video footage and photo evidence of the abandoned skeletons.Tech Buzz Just in time for Earth Day, Asus announces a new PC with a bamboo case that will be released in June. Here’s something that ecogeeks, techgeeks, and pandas can all get excited about. Mac users will unfortunately miss out, but I don’t know any pandas that are Mac users anyway.Celebrity Buzz Everybody loves Tin Fey. Or do they? Yes, they do, mostly. Despite the delicious Schadenfreude a Tina Fey backlash might produce, one just doesn’t appear to be materializing, even though her new movie, Baby Mama, has been getting tepid early reviews. She’s still got that one funny showCulture Buzz It’s been years since Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch published one of their controversial catalogs. They’ve just announced that they’ll be releasing a racier Europe-only version featuring male nudity. American Eagle is great for your tween fashion needs, but it’s not going to satisfy your insatiable appetite for tasteful gay porn. Can American Apparel be out-whored?Science Buzz Scientific research shows that sophisticated footwear actually does our feet more harm than good. A new line of shoes created by the son of the creator of indie staples Clarks, Wallabees simulate the experience of walking barefoot. Those of us choosing to eschew shoes all together can join a number of organizations including The Society for Barefoot Living , empowering you to contest that burdensome “No Shoes, No Shirt, No Service” sign at your favorite fast-food establishment.Celebrity Buzz Topless pictures have surfaced of…the comedian famous for his mustard yellow suits and caterpillar mustache? Apparently, this is all part of his “Take Your Shirt Off” campaign. Greased up and rockin’ the Mom Jeans, Steve Harvey and friends have done a fantastic job in encouraging the importance of fitness while inadvertently warning the public against the overuse of self-tanner (pick a skin tone, dude!).Culture Buzz Dmitri Nabokov, son of Vladimir, has decided to publish The Original of Laura, the novel his dying father commanded be destroyed. Here’s a reminder that next time you write something you don’t want anyone else to read, you might want to think twice. That bastard child of yours might want to publish it after you’re dead!Food Buzz Marilyn Manson has released his own brand of 66.6% proof absinthe. The authentic absinthe is made in Switzerland, and per Manson’s specifications contains the highest amount of wormwood allowed by law. The 19th century bohemian spirit once favored by Ernest Hemingway, Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde is now officially on its way to becoming the drink of choice for goth pre-prom parties.Sports Buzz The most despised player in hockey has applied for a position as a Vogue intern. Hardcore sports fans might say that he belongs at Barney’s more than the hockey field, but at least he’s stirring up some drama in the otherwise humdrum world of hockey.Music Buzz The much-loved trip hop trio releases their first album in 10 years. Stream it now on Last.fm. Can it be nostalgic to listen to a new album? Really takes you back to the days of the Clinton Administration! The album comes out on April 29, but the pre-release on Last.fm has drawn a record number of listeners.Tech Buzz This year’s gathering in Germany showcases Artificial Intelligence designed to rescue humans and play soccer, among other less awesome things. Yes, it’s all very impressive, but get back to us when there’s a model that can brilliantly deliver dinner like a pro.Style Buzz Sneakers that extend with your child’s growing feet. Let’s face it: most little kids are bratty and do not deserve stylish shoes. What these shoes lack in coolness, they make up for in practicality, saving parents a few extra trips to the shoe store.Culture Buzz Ze Frank’s new project is a collection of childhood photographs compared with present day recreations. The addictive website’s amazing collection of submissions range from adorable to pretty creepy. Some of the most faithful recreations have spared no detail depicting adults packed into Superman costumes, sitting on their mother’s laps, or taking a bath while fully dressed.Music Buzz The tenor broke the Metropolitan Opera’s 14-year ban on solo encores after nailing nine high C’s to a thrilled crowd. He hit all the high notes in his encore, too. The last - and only other - guy to get an encore at the Met was somebody named Luciano Pavarotti, in 1994.Tech Buzz Cat 5 ethernet rings are $175 and fit together perfectly for nerding, happily ever after. A reminder that no matter what, the rough times during your marriage won’t be anything a little software upgrade or patch won’t fix. For us cynics, it’s also a reminder that in relationships, it’s easy to get pwned.Style Buzz Famous tailor Bruce Oldfield has redesigned McDonald’s uniforms for its UK staff with darker tones, three piece suits and pencil skirts. Don’t be surprised next time you order a Whopper from a lady in white gloves and an evening gown - the fast food wars are vicious.Music Buzz Brush off your kente cloth robe and clean up that fade - the hip hop trio is reuniting for the upcoming Rock The Bells tour. Amid economic recession, an ongoing war overseas, and George Bush in the White House, this summer should feel like 1992 all over again!Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
