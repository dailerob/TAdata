{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tech Buzz The next edition of Guitar Hero is going to be all-Aerosmith, all the time. You\u0027ll have to listen to a lot of Stephen Tyler, but you\u0027ll get to play a lot Joe Perry.View the 5 Best LinksScience Buzz Home semen detection kit marketed to suspicious spouses. Trying to live out your fantasy of being a CSI? Didn\u0027t we learn anything from Superbad?View the 6 Best LinksPolitics Buzz A viral, homemade campaign ad goes bad. There\u0027s no doubt the song in this video is catchy. But that doesn\u0027t make it good.View the 5 Best LinksStyle Buzz This giant handbag trend simply will not die. Maybe it\u0027s part of the eco-bag trend, but toting around a mini-suitcase guarantees that you\u0027ll always pretty much be up for whatever, whether it\u0027s a trip to Whole Foods or a slumber party.View the 10 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Superdelegates are delegates to the Democratic National Convention who are seated automatically, based solely on their status as current or former elected officeholders and party officials. They are free to vote for whichever candidate, throwing a wrench into campaign strategy. (Yeah, we lifted that definition from Wikipedia.) There\u0027s a lot of talk today about Rep. John Lewis defecting to the Obama camp, possibly creating a domino effect amongst other superdelegates.View the 10 Best LinksTech Buzz The Wall Street Journal reports on creepy thieves who can only bring themselves to rip off other people\u0027s dating profiles. There\u0027s apparently something prohibitively daunting about trying to figure out the tough questions in life, like \"What movies do you like?\", \"what celebrity do you resemble?\" and \"how would you describe yourself?\"View the 3 Best LinksScience Buzz A Swiss company says it has created the world\u0027s first truly submersible car - and it\u0027s a convertible. In addition to being a submarine and looking really cool, it\u0027s also a zero emissions vehicle to boot. Now you just need a hot spy-girlfriend to go along with it.View the 6 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Meghan McCain\u0027s little brother takes over blogging duties over at McCainBlogette.com. He\u0027s kind of hot in a totally main way, like that one frat dude who seems like a pretty good guy but you can\u0027t really understand why he associates himself with the usual gang of idiots. Anyway, check out McCainBlogette for political coverage that reads like a 17-year-old\u0027s LiveJournal.View the 4 Best LinksScience Buzz The new smoking-cessation wonder drug really does help people quit, but apparently it also causes nightmares, blackouts, paranoia, depression, hallucinations, and even suicide. Well, no one ever said quitting was easy. The FDA is investigating, and stated recently that a connection between Chantix and serious psychiatric problems appears \"increasingly likely.\"View the 9 Best LinksTech Buzz A new sport where competitors race to detangle bundles of CAT-5 ethernet cables. Ok, yeah. We read about this on BoingBoing. It\u0027s probably the most quintessentially BoingBoing thing ever. Well, now you know what those IT guys are going to be doing this weekend.View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz The 27-year-old is officially named the gunman in yesterday\u0027s shooting at Northern Illinois University. Police announced the name of the shooter at a press conference today. Kazmierczak killed five people before killing himself, and had reportedly recently gone off his medication.View the 7 Best LinksCulture Buzz Green is sexy these days, so it was probably inevitable that eventually people would start offering tips about how to make your sex life more green. Ideas include all-natural lube, eco-undies, biodegradable condoms, and environmentally friendly sex toys. Some are even suggesting the old-fashioned DIY approach to dildos—after all, you can\u0027t get much greener than a cucumber.View the 7 Best LinksPolitics Buzz A U.S. Circuit Court has overturned a Texas law outlawing the \"selling, giving, lending, distributing, or advertising\" of sex toys. We do hope this makes it all the way to the Supreme Court, if only to hear Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u0027s opinion.View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz A soft, squeezable pillow with the pulse of a beating heart inside of it. Unlike the Boyfriend Pillow, which you would probably want to stuff away into your closet when company comes over, this designy pillow actually looks cute and modern.View the 6 Best LinksCulture Buzz A site that lists and explains the things that white people like, such as expensive sandwiches (#63), religions their parents don\u0027t belong to (#2) and apologies (#55). Things yet to be added to the list: Ski boots, talking about Roth IRAs and decimating native populations.View the 5 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz The 21-year-old \"image director\" on the Meatpacking district club circuit was profiled by the Times. We actually find him slightly more palatable than most male socialites, in particular because he kind of looks like a self-portrait of a young Egon Schiele.View the 6 Best LinksCulture Buzz Find out more about ethical and fair-trade flowers for Valentine\u0027s Day. If you met your Valentine off one of those eco-dating websites, some ethical flowers should take you to the next level of \"soulmate.\"View the 8 Best LinksCulture Buzz When you care enough to be ironic, send the very best. If you\u0027re still casting about for inappropriate cards to send your co-workers, we\u0027ve got you covered.View the 6 Best LinksMusic Buzz The biggest-selling album of all time gets the re-release treatment - Kanye West and Akon offer remixes - and everyone loves it. Sure, the actual anniversary was last year. But the just-released anniversary edition is, how you say, startin\u0027 somethin\u0027.View the 7 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Obama has gotten some big-name Republicans to back him. Conservatives disenchanted with the Bush administration and disappointed by McCain have defected to the Obama camp. Influential conservatives like William Bennett, Rich Lowry, and Peggy Noonan have said favorable things about Obama. And we don\u0027t think they\u0027re being ironic either, the way that Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh have announced that they\u0027re backing Hillary.View the 10 Best LinksMovie Buzz The first teaser trailer for the fourth Indy movie hits the web today. The elder Harrison Ford reprises the title role, with Shia LeBouf and Cate Blanchett thrown in for good measure.View the 6 Best LinksCulture Buzz A huge fuzzy blanket with sleeves for your arms. These have been around for awhile, but it\u0027s a cold, wintry night and we can\u0027t think of anything we\u0027d rather do than curl up on the couch in a giant slanket and update our Facebook profiles.View the 11 Best LinksMusic Buzz Spike Jonze, a Playboy model and a desert execution storyline. The video debuts on BET later tonight, but even the first half, which appeared online today, has been getting a lot of buzz. Check back for the second (and third?) part when we can find it.View the 3 Best LinksPolitics Buzz With the Democratic contest for the White House coming down to the wire, there\u0027s a discrepancy over how media outlets count delegates. Who\u0027s got the best counting system? The New York Times and the Associated Press can\u0027t agree, though as of today both put Obama slightly in the lead.View the 4 Best LinksTech Buzz CNN\u0027s new user-generated news site. It\u0027s a totally separate site from CNN\u0027s new properties, making iReport another good example of the mullet strategy (though in this case there are actually two different heads, which, uh, stretches our metaphor just a bit).View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz Americans born between 1982 and 2003 are just now starting to enter the workforce, arousing speculation of what their impact will be. As members of Generation X, we wonder, will the new generation of millennials have anything quite as meaningful as Reality Bites?View the 10 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz Chinese-Canadian Hong Kong movie actor and pop icon is embroiled in a sex scandal now that sexually explicit photos of him with numerous female stars have been leaked. For anyone who\u0027s ever complained there weren\u0027t enough Asian males represented in the media, there\u0027s finally a role model! We suppose it takes pulling a Paris Hilton to get noticed.View the 10 Best LinksTech Buzz Tips and tricks from Nick Denton and his minions about how to write the perfect Gawker item. Pearls of web-writing advice like \"one joke per post\" and \"not longer than 200 words.\"View the 4 Best LinksSports Buzz Standing for human growth hormone, it claims to increase metabolism, muscle mass, and even increase height. The big scandal is that New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte has admitted to using human growth hormone in 2004. Debbie Clemens also gets outted by her husband for using it to get ready for a Sports Illustrated shoot. What a convoluted, sordid story of lies and betrayal. All over a drug that\u0027s used by the cattle industry and she-males alike.View the 15 Best LinksMusic Buzz Auto-tune is the reason why the vocals on pop songs sound so fake. This list of top 10 songs that exemplify auto-tune abuse has been circulating on the web. Do you believe in life after love? We have a harder time believing that the vocal effect that makes us think of Cher in a slutty unitard has made its way into gangsta rap.View the 6 Best LinksBuzz Archive ?
