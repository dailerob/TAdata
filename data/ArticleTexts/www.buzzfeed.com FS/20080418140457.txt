{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Movie Buzz Another day, another sumer blockbuster now shrouded in a cloud of crappiness. With reports of a bloated running time (140 minutes) and rumors that \"the movie may not have turned out to be what people in the industry call \u0027good\u0027,\" Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull looks like it may not be the summer savior Hollywood had been hoping for.View the 5 Best LinksSports Buzz With 17 fatalities on the slopes already this year, Colorado\u0027s ski areas are suddenly under scrutiny. There\u0027s a minor debate going over why there\u0027s been a sudden spike in ski area deaths: Too many snowboarders? New, fast equipment? Too many groomed runs, where people go too fast? Statistical randomness? File this under stuff nobody likes.View the 5 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz The pet chow of Martha Stewart has passed away and is remembered in a photo essay on his famous owner\u0027s blog. For a lady whose heart many would claim is the color of gun metal, Martha really manages to tactfully handle the process of grieving for a pet (although her wrapping the corpse is, admittedly, mildly creepy).View the 6 Best LinksSports Buzz ESPN sideline reporter has quite the YouTube following, including 1 million hits on a video that\u0027s just a slideshow of random photos of her. She\u0027s got that right amount of hotness to be alluring but not intimidating. We bet her hair smells like strawberries.View the 9 Best LinksCulture Buzz Their sketch show on the BBC, That Mitchell And Webb Look, have earned them hardcore fans on both sides of the pond. Monty Python has found a welcome replacement in the cleverly absurd blokes who, incidentally, also star in the UK version of the Mac-vs.-PC ads. Bloody brilliant! (Also be sure to check out Peep Show, another Mitchell and Webb show we highly recommend.)View the 9 Best LinksPolitics Buzz A New York Times story on the polling trend of microtargeting says that what you eat is linked to how you vote. We had Popeye\u0027s for lunch today (chicken sandwich plus biscuit \u003d yum), which apparently makes us Democrats.View the 4 Best LinksFood Buzz Aged batches of the Brazilian liquor - distilled from sugar cane - are popular among discerning booze hounds. You may know cachaca from the much-loved summer drink, the caipirinha, but now the humble spirit is coming into its own.View the 6 Best LinksCulture Buzz The wife of a major Broadway theater operator airs their sordid marriage secrets on YouTube in order to gain leverage in a divorce. Watch the YouTube divorce video. Tricia\u0027s crazy eyes and theatrical over-acting seems to discredit her case more than help it.View the 9 Best LinksStyle Buzz Her outrageous spandex creations have been seen on bands like CSS and Tilly and the Wall. Do you dare to wear spandex alphabet-print leggings, suspenders, and no top underneath? Seems like Peggy Noland is picking up where Heatherette left off.View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz Britain\u0027s first Islamic pub provides a recreational place for Muslims to hang out and relax in, without the beer. Is it a waste to hang out in a bar and not get wasted? (Thanks for the tip!)View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz The New Yorker delves into the secret lives of elevators, including the story of a man who was stuck inside one for 41 hours (and it was all caught on tape!). We don\u0027t know about you, but after reading this piece, we\u0027ll take the stairs. See you in the lobby.View the 6 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz Apparently, straight gals everywhere are going gaga for the star of Work Out. And who can blame them? She\u0027s got Ryan Phillipe\u0027s looks, Donald Trump\u0027s business savvy, and Matthew McConaughey\u0027s abs. And a vagina!View the 7 Best LinksTV Buzz Audrina\u0027s scummy ex-boyfriend from The Hills lands a modeling gig for men\u0027s label, Orthodox. So cold, yet so hot. We felt kind of evil inside for being disappointed when Audrina dumped Justin Bobby in hopes of finding a healthy relationship.View the 7 Best LinksCulture Buzz The Costa Rican artist is the target of much controversy after he tied up an allegedly starving dog who some claimed died while on \"display.\" You know what else constitutes as art? Fingerpainting and decoupage, and neither of those things involve killing innocent creatures.View the 8 Best LinksMovie Buzz The film is suffering a backlash before it even comes out, which we\u0027re calling a prelash. The main complaint is one we hear more and more, and it\u0027s certainly not limited to Iron Man: The trailer gives away too much. It\u0027s so packed, the Onion has mocked it; fans are nervous there may not be much left to be surprised by in the actual movie.View the 4 Best LinksPolitics Buzz A student group dedicated to legalizing the carrying of concealed weapons on college campuses. A year after the Virigina Tech shootings that inspired the formation of the group, Students for Concealed Carry on Campus (SCCC) has over 25,000 members. Founder Michael Flitcraft, a 23-year-old University of Cincinnati sophomore, wants all students over 21 with gun licenses to be able to carry their concealed weapons at school, too.View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz A small desert town in Texas has an interesting art scene. If you ever wanted to say goodbye to the city, Marfa seems like the ideal artists\u0027 community where you could go without being driven crazy by the fact that you\u0027re in the South.View the 7 Best LinksStyle Buzz Telegraph UK examines the phenomenon of women wearing minimiser bras to fit into trendy boy-cut clothing.

He gave the cartoon version of the school a fictional name, Bristol County Secondary School, and the final result is now available in book form, too, through the artist\u0027s website.View the 4 Best LinksStyle Buzz New wallpaper technology that emits light with the flip of a switch. Designer Jonas Samson has invented a new kind of wallpaper: Made of several different layers which conduct electricity or emit light, overlaid with patterns of traditional wallpaper. It\u0027s still prohibitively expensive, so we\u0027ll wait until Ikea comes up with a knock-off version to redo the office bathrooms.View the 4 Best LinksCulture Buzz The Kids in the Hall reunited for a nationwide tour beginning April 17th, featuring all new material. Here\u0027s a reunion that we can actually get behind. Well, besides the NKOTB one, of course. It keeps getting easier and easier to relive our teenager years.View the 7 Best LinksCulture Buzz Between a new book about them and the recent reunion of their band Yo Ho Wa 13, the 1970s Los Angeles-based cult The Source is getting a lot of attention. The Source, led by Jim Baker aka Father Yod, was a pioneer in the organic food movement. Their restaurant on Sunset Boulevard was a hot spot for celebrities like Warren Beatty, Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan and was the location for that scene in Annie Hall where Woody orders \"the alfalfa sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast\" from the white-robed waitress.View the 11 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz The arrival of Pope Benedict XVI throws the U.S. into a fit of fandom.

If there ever were a BuzzFeed cute band alert, Harry and the Potters would undoubtedly be one of them.View the 9 Best LinksCulture Buzz A Flickr gallery that brings you the joys of tagged legal tender. Joe D! makes money into something more. We noticed, though: No Benjamins. People who deface currency will only go so far for their art.View the 9 Best LinksPolitics Buzz The YouTube sensation featuring a trio of women singing pro-McCain songs turns out to be a hoax masterminded by 23/6, a humor website. Everyone seems to have an opinion. This YouTube comment pretty much sums it all up: \"your song is stupid and mccain is wierd.\" (Thanks for the tip!)View the 7 Best LinksCulture Buzz J.K. Rowling testified in court against a fan who hopes to make a lexicon from the Harry Potter series. Is making an encyclopedia of Harry Potter lore stealing or fair use? A teary Rowling called what Steve Vander Ark has done with \"The Harry Potter Lexicon\" - currently only a website, but soon to possibly be a book as well - nothing less than \"wholesale theft.\"View the 5 Best LinksTech Buzz Polaroid is discontinuing the production of their instant film, but they will be coming out with a hand-size printer that produces color snapshots in about 30 seconds. We like the way Polaroids have the uncanny ability to make every image look like it\u0027s from 1982. This printer looks pretty cool, but in the meantime, we\u0027ll be buying all the Polaroid film reserves we can get off eBay.View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz An organization called the Anti-Advertising Agency has started an anti-consumerism guerilla movement.
