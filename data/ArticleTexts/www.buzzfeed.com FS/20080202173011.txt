So that \"bird poo in reporter\u0027s mouth\" everyone sent you this week was actually the first salvo in a very meta marketing campaign for Frumondah, a non-existent African soft drink. A new video from Bob Odenkirk explains the ties.

If you live in NYC, you can go see them this weekend! Lucky you.View the 10 Best LinksFood Buzz The Pickle Sickle is just that: A pickle in frozen popsicle form. Another potential \u002708 trend: Weird packaged food.

Yes, it\u0027s a $72,000 motorcycle made of titanium and capable of reaching speeds up to 200 m.p.h.
