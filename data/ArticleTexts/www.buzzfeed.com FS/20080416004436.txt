Rowling testified in court against a fan who hopes to make a lexicon from the Harry Potter series. Is making an encyclopedia of Harry Potter lore stealing or fair use?

We like the way Polaroids have the uncanny ability to make every image look like it\u0027s from 1982. This printer looks pretty cool, but in the meantime, we\u0027ll be buying all the Polaroid film reserves we can get off eBay.View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz An organization called the Anti-Advertising Agency has started an anti-consumerism guerilla movement.

Even Gawker, the foremost authority on How To Publicly Belittle Media Figures, can\u0027t help but obsess over her every move, pose, or post (and they arguably made her career in the first place).

With John Hughes\u0027 name popping up lately in association with Drillbit Taylor (it seems he cowrote the film under the psuedonym Edmond Dantes), we\u0027ve been asking ourselves why this guy pulled a J.D.
