{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tech Buzz Finally, a social networking feature that mirrors the half-attention of real life. FriendFeed now lets you tell people you’re following them when, in fact, you’re ignoring their feed. Sort of like a cocktail party or family gathering, minus the face-to-face. Contribute ›Two photos of the same person from different ages, put together. Contribute ›Sports Buzz A youth baseball league has banned a 9-year-old, and disbanded his team, because he throws too hard. The controversial world of youth sports is apparently run by a bunch of commies! Contribute ›The famous fashion designer apparently loves rap. And looks ridiculous. Contribute ›Food Buzz The New York Sun has an interesting article about how prepared salad bars can be misleading in terms of nutrition and calories. Don’t let me anywhere near that section of Whole Foods if I’m actually hungry. At least there’s some sense of portion control when you order a Popeyes meal combo. Contribute ›It’s the new “I Like Turtles”! After weatherman Warren Dean signs this starstruck yokel’s giant pin with Warren’s face on it, the weirdo can’t stop staring giddily at him and has to be pushed out of the way twice during a live weather report at the Saskatoon fair. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Firefox extension that filters YouTube comments based on grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. We need this for the entire internet. Contribute ›Culture Buzz The Orwell Prize, Britain’s pre-eminent prize for political writing, is publishing George Orwell’s diaries as a blog. What would George Orwell’s internet presence be if he were alive today? He probably would have a blog, and probably also a Make Out Club profile. Contribute ›Movie Buzz The latest casting rumor about Batman 3 puts Cher in the cat suit. She joins Johnny Depp and Phillip Seymour Hoffman in the list of unlikely choices Christopher Nolan would make for the follow-up to The Dark Knight — up next, Al Pacino as Robin. Contribute ›Politics Buzz Authorities break up an alleged Obama Assassination plot. A few really bad dudes were arrested in Denver. We are talking rifles with scopes, white power tattoos, and meth. They may have been planning to kill Obama. Contribute ›Richard Dawkins receives a crapton of hate-mail from Creationists. Contribute ›A billboard for The Daily Show outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport welcoming the arrival of the delegates attending next week’s Republican National Convention. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz New York’s youthful celebrity real estate broker. When one of the Olsens wants to find an apartment for Heath Ledger to die in, they call Seligman. And he’s only 21! Of course he is. Contribute ›Style Buzz Collections of transfixing motion-blur photos have been popping up around the web. Motion blur: The new til-shift photography. Contribute ›Sports Buzz A new study has shown that cheerleading is the most dangerous school sport for females. Two-thirds of all catastrophic injuries among high school and college girls have been from cheerleading accidents. Apparently, that’s worse than gymnastics and track \u0026 field combined. It kinda gives you a whole new respect for spirit fingers. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Burning Man’s up-to-the-minute blog from the desert. With the annual desert art orgy kicking off today in Black Rock City, Nevada, the Burning Blog should be fun to watch for info, news, happenings, and more! Never before has blogging been so hot. Contribute ›High gas prices make his private jet too pricey, says Diddy in his latest YouTube clip, which he made while boarding an American Airlines flight. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Mixing Crayon Physics and Magic Pen, it’s a Flash game that lets you build tiny animated machines. The object is simple: Create a contraption to move a ball or block across the screen. It’s easy to test and change your contraptions, plus you can see what other players have done in the past to compare ideas. Contribute ›TV Buzz The 22-year-old actress plays the new girl, Jane, on Mad Men. Don Draper’s fourth secretary was a circus of décolletage on the most recent episode that aired this past weekend. Contribute ›Food Buzz A printer that replaces ink with caramel syrup to print on your milk foam. Looks like a new revenue stream just opened for Starbucks: latte advertising.
