To be fair, we should\u0027ve seen coming in the trailer when Drew Barrymore\u0027s flock of geighz insist that “MySpace is the new booty call.” Ugh, nobody says that, gay or straight.Can someone explain why a commercial for heartburn medicine features a perfectly pleasant woman being forced to “Mom Dance” at a silent office party??
