{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Culture Buzz The list of famous virgins is surprisingly long. Yes, Jane Austen was a virgin (but NOT Anne Hathaway, we assume). Also: Immanuel Kant, Emily Dickinson, Sir Isaac Newton. Are virgins more productive? This seems like an illogical argument, given the vastly larger number of famous high-achieving people who did have sex during their lives; it’s also kind of sad. Still, Morrissey wrote his best stuff during that “celibate” phase. Contribute ›Movie Buzz One of Iran’s most popular actresses, Farahani was just banned from leaving her native country after starring in “Body of Lies” with Leonardo DiCaprio. Apparently the movie portrays some of the more negative aspects of Iranian culture, including the national drug problem and Al-Qaeda connections. Perhaps they should have also put banning people from the airport on that list. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Two big-time YouTube creators got almost a million views combined for their eyewitness videos of an explosion in Toronto that killed two people. Except they weren’t really there. Exploitation? Innocent fun? Oh probably just innocent fun. But when everyone makes YouTube mashups of the next big terrorist attack, it’s gonna get awwwwkwaaaard. Contribute ›Politics Buzz U.S. Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, the first African-American woman to represent Ohio in Congress, was reported dead today by a number of professional news outlets. Only problem was, she wasn’t! Rather, Rep. Jones is currently in critical condition after suffering from a brain aneurysm. Contribute ›Politics Buzz Michael Moore wants Caroline Kennedy for Barack’s VP choice, and thinks there’s a chance she could nominate herself. One…last…Vice Presidential speculation as we stand by our cellphones awaiting that fateful text…. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Some ideas for make-it-yourself sex toys with household items. Do your friends refer to you as the Martha Stewart of dildos? If so, be sure to add your projects here! Contribute ›YouTube’s favorite little rapper presents his “Rich Nigga Shit”: A Segway, a T-mobile Sidekick, and a robe with his name on it. Contribute ›Bullets, stationary objects and high-speed photography combine to make a nice anti-gun PSA. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Palm finally officially releases it’s next smartphone, a thin, unlocked handset aimed at Blackberry, not Apple. It’s refreshing to see a mobile phone not attempt to position itself as an iPhone killer. The Treo Pro is for the professional set, will be sold unlocked in the U.S. for $549. Contribute ›Culture Buzz This 12-year-old is 7 feet tall and still growing! Mutant alert! He says, “I’m always mentally and physically happy all the time, I guess,” which is odd considering a) he’s a mutant and b) he’s in junior high, but whatevs. We’ll take your word for it! Contribute ›Culture Buzz Colleges, bars, even entire cities (Belmar, N.J.) are banning the game of Beer Pong in an effort to curb binge drinking. Last fall, Georgetown University banned the game, the tables, as well as having an inordinate amount of ping-pong balls. Contribute ›Culture Buzz The Talking Heads frontman designed 9 ridiculous looking bike racks for NYC streets. With names like “The Hipster”, “The Coffee Cup” and “Olde Times Square”, Byrne’s bike racks are meant to capture the essence of New York City neighborhoods and encourage people to ride their bikes. Contribute ›There was a certain time when all of us were really good swimmers. Contribute ›Style Buzz No-coverage bras that are literally just the underwire. Am I just a prude, or do you find these creepy, too? Contribute ›Movie Buzz Lawyers for Fox are suing Warner Brothers to prevent their upcoming $120 million release of “Watchmen”. Apparently, Fox bought the rights to a “Watchmen” movie back in the 80’s, and may be trying to stop Warner Bros from ever releasing the highly anticipated film. But, knowing Fox, they’ll probably just settle for a superhero payday. Contribute ›Movie Buzz OMG, there will officially be a sequel to the 2000 teen flick, a guilty pleasure packed with toe shoes and insane dance montages. Better yet, ABT dancer Ethan Stiefel will reprise his role as Cooper Nielson, the ultimate lothario in spandex (because there are so many), and Peter Gallagher will bring his eyebrows to the screen yet again. Contribute ›Sports Buzz Bolt won gold in both the 100 and 200 meters, setting a new world record in both. 19.30 seconds, beating Michael Johnson’s 19.32. Incredible. Also: Good last name. Contribute ›TV Buzz She has a new show called The Cho Show and it seems like she’s everywhere lately. Do you like to laugh? Do you love Asians? Are you kinda gay? You’ll probably be watching this show anyway, then. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Her son Michael wasn’t the only star in the family at the Olympics. After getting more camera time than most athletes at the Games, she’s been named a style icon — her Chico’s outfits have led to a surge of popularity for the brand, and she’s already got her own line with them (plus an agent and other deals with Johnson’s Baby and the the ADHD Foundation). Contribute ›Tech Buzz Out Magazine asks if the gay men’s hookup site - which reportedly rakes in $30 million yearly - has destroyed gay culture. It would be interesting to hear what John McCain had to say about the situation, considering that he gladly accepted the maximum amount for an individual donation from the “liberal Republican” owner of Manhunt.
