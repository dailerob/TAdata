Google recruited 68 artists, designers and musicians to create the ‘Artist Themes’ including Dolce and Gabbana, Diane Von Fusterberg and Oscar de la Renta, Artists Shepard Fairey, Philippe Starck, Todd Oldman, Jeff Koons, and Marc Ecko. It’s fun to switch it up but in most cases what works on a wrap dress doesn’t really work as a web design.Style Buzz A New York spa is offering a a ‘Geisha Facial’ that involves the use of nightingale excrement. Apparently the powder know as uguisu no fun has been used in Japan since the 18th century and contains the amino acid guanine which is said to brighten and cleanse the skin. Nothing it too insane for me when it comes to my skin so I am willing to give it a shot. Luckily the girls at Jezebel found uguisu no fun online for less than $20.Sports Buzz Yet another sad tale of naughty pictures online. Pictures of some of the Arizona State cheerleading squad in their underwear taken almost two years ago have led to the school disbanding the entire team. Between this and Tiffany Sheperd, we may finally be able to forget about Miley Cyrus for a little while.Celebrity Buzz Actress, jewelry designer and now blogger, Trachtenberg’s star is on the rise. She’s mean and possibly psychotic on Gossip Girl, but her aw-shucks blog posts for Cosmopolitan are sickly sweet.Culture Buzz A 30-year-old high school science teacher has been fired for some bikini-clad photos that appear on a fishing charter-boat website. Sucks for Tiffany. But business must be booming for whoever came up with the idea of combining deep sea fishing and busty bikini-clad girls. It’s like Hooters on a boat!Science Buzz This online video - also available for download (beware: it’s 50mb!) - tackles the consequences of American hyper-consumption in a refreshingly irreverent manner. Seriously, shut down your computer, unplug your iPod, turn off your PDA, cap your water bottle, take off your sunglasses, and learn how to make a difference. Don’t worry - it’s only 20 minutes long, so you can get back to texting shortly.Culture Buzz Um, the dog pictured here is dead. And freeze-dried. Because, apparently, people do that. Finally, crazy cat ladies have a way to hoard felines without getting arrested! Because they’re all dead!Culture Buzz Enough with the brass tubes already! There’s a rising backlash against the sci-fi inspired, Victorian-flavored subculture and its love of all things Jules Verne.Style Buzz Electrical pair of pants claims to massage your nether-regions for up to 20 minutes at a time. Actually, I’m not even kidding, but I’ve been searching high and low for denim shorts in this shade of blue for months now.TV Buzz MTV UK has picked up Fur TV, an adult comedy series about a group of foulmouthed, sex-mad puppets, made by Warp Films. It’s airing on MTV UK this weekend, but there’s plenty of videos online for us non-Brits. I predict imminent cult status, at least among furries.Tech Buzz Saturday, May 3 is international Shutdown Day. The idea is simple, if slightly insane: Turn off your computer and leave it off for 24 hours. You’ll be able to do other things, like take a walk in the park, talk to people face to face or go see a show — you know, things that don’t involve the internet. Sounds scary.Celebrity Buzz Rumors quickly swirled about Mariah Carey’s engagement to actor Nick Cannon, but apparently they’ve since been married at her home in the Bahamas. Twelve years Carey’s junior, Nick is excited to be gaining both a wife and — perhaps in enough time — a MILF.Celebrity Buzz Whitney Houston’s 15-year-old daughter tries to stab Whitney during an argument, then attempts to kill herself by slashing her wrists. Wayward children of crackhead parents make for great reality television! I’d much rather watch a show about a rebellious teenager than a washed-up R\u0026B star any day.Culture Buzz Texan cartoonist Austin Kleon blacks out the majority of text in newspaper articles, revealing new poems made from the leftovers. Well, if the Internet is, indeed, killing newspapers, at least it will leave in its wake a very cool art form. That’s something, right?Celebrity Buzz The sultry Lebanese singer makes headlines for being banned from performing in Bahrain. Bahrain’s parliament was worried about the effect her exposed flesh might have on the public and passed a motion to stop her show. Oddly, she went ahead and performed anyway, albeit in a long, none-too-revealing gown.Culture Buzz Good luck ritual practiced in India where babies are dropped from the roof of a building. The theory is: if you can survive being dropped 100 feet as a baby, you can probably go on to do anything.Food Buzz Designers and crafters are producing creative alternatives to cardboard Java Jackets. The designs range from a wooden cuff that doubles as a bracelet to knitted and patchwork sleeves with pockets. I wonder how long until Louis Vuitton and Gucci get in on the action.Celebrity Buzz Websites devoted to tracking the weird semi-public figures in a city near you. Taking the character you see on the way to work every morning and elevating him or her to the level of semi-celebrity, tracking local eccentrics via the web is a special sub-genre of internet famous.Food Buzz Michelin-starred techno-chef Heston Blumenthal OBE wins an award for splicing together grapes and cocoa beans to create chocolate wine. A way to damage your liver and get diabetes at the same time! Get the recipe here.Tech Buzz Built-in Wi-Fi detectors are popping up on watches, bags, pens, T-Shirts and even sneakers. As much as I am ready to embrace my inner geek, I think I am going to hold out for the Wi-Fi sniffing platform gladiator sandals.Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
