{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"A trailer for the new Coen Brothers’ movie hits the web.Food Buzz A non-essential amino acid found in watermelons (and in other fruits \u0026 veggies, though in lower amounts) that’s being added to sport drinks and even chewing gum. It’s reported to reduce muscle fatigue - we’ll be needing some of this stuff at our weekly BuzzFeed badminton games!Style Buzz In partnership with eBay, Bill Cosby is auctioning off his old sweaters to benefit Hello Friend, a charity he established after the murder of his son. If the auction is a success, don’t be surprised if Bea Arthur auctions off her signature pleather caftans to benefit crippled horses. (Fingers crossed!)Food Buzz Charcoal schmarcoal! This barbecue in a box replaces charcoal and lighter fluid with biodegradable paper pulp that is both recyclable and free of chemicals. Even better, it will keep your meat from tasting like a car engine.Tech Buzz He brought us the Segway but also so much more: The Luke prosthetic arm is something way beyond those monkey robots. Kamen’s made a career of thinking differently. He revolutionized dialysis treatments, created a stair-climbing wheelchair, all before unleashing the Segway on the world. His newest project is a lightweight arm that’s fully customizable and lets the wearer pick up a grape and eat it. Kamen’s also working on a version controlled fully by the user’s thought, which can be read non-invasively using infrared.Food Buzz A hot dog wrapped in ground beef then deep-fried, topped with chili, cheese, grilled onions, and served in a hoagie roll. It was very difficult trying to find an appetizing photo of something that sounds so insanely delicious. You know it’s summer when you’re stuffing a giant hamdog in your face!Movie Buzz A new independent comedy about a suburban martial arts teacher that Will Ferrell claims is “the best comedy ever.” It’s that type of vulgar, lewd humor with just the right amount of heart that sensitive guys and fratboys can simultaneously appreciate.Style Buzz Men’s tailored suits with shorts instead of pants. Business up top, party down low! I knew it wouldn’t be long before the romper trend crossed over into men’s fashion.Science Buzz Jeff Peckman of Denver is lobbying city officials to establish an Extraterrestrial Affairs Commission in preparation for alien contact. In fact, he’s apparently got exclusive video footage proving their existence, but we can’t see it yet because it’s being used in a forthcoming documentary. Peckman’s video allegedly shows a four-foot tall creature popping up outside a window, blinking. So, congratulations, Jeff Peckman! You’ve started your very own Groundhog Day, but with aliens and for crazy people!Movie Buzz Panned by the Times and New Yorker, with tepid reviews elsewhere, the movie’s opening weekend will still probably be huge. No one ever compared Sex and the City to The Wire — Dickensian it ain’t — but most people don’t care, they just want to see Carrie buy expensive clothes and talk about love.Members of one of the world’s last uncontacted tribes have been spotted and photographed from the air near the Brazil-Peru border.Music Buzz Almost simultaneously, publications everywhere are looking for the worst record covers of all time — and there are plenty to choose from. The zeitgeist turns a critical eye to the truly awful work of the bygone era of vinyl.Movie Buzz In the film Stuck, Mena Suvari plays Brandi, a character based on an African American woman who was convicted of murder after abandoning a homeless man she’d hit with her car. Suvari, who dons cornrows and “ghetto fabulous nails” to play the part, describes her character as “a particular kind of girl from a particular place,” which must be the new way of saying ‘urban’.Celebrity Buzz Yup, the American Idol runner-up is preparing for fatherhood as he’s successfully inseminated Jaymes Foster, the 50 year-old sister of producer David Foster. It’s a good thing Aiken’s loaded, because when you’ve got one mommy and one age-defying, gender-bending eunuch for a dad, the therapy bills loom in shadows.Celebrity Buzz Although she hasn’t seen the Sex And The City movie yet, the model-actress can confirm that it’s positively silly material written by “gay male sluts.” She then immediately retracted the statement, realizing that without “gay male sluts,” her IMDB page would continue to gather dust as she makes cameo appearances on basic cable.The third (and final?) video for the song, which looks like it was filmed on location in Disney’s Haunted House.Politics Buzz Canadian women have come up with a campaign to exploit the Myanmar junta’s superstitious belief that coming into contact with women’s underwear will rob them of their strength. It sounds silly, but any little bit could help the horribly violent situation in Burma. Finally, an underwear trend that I don’t feel guilty or dirty about posting!Culture Buzz Al Gore’s climate warnings are being turned into an opera for La Scala in Milan. It’s kind of hard to imagine a topic more dramatic and at the same time less opera-ready. The Carbon Emission Aria just doesn’t have that diva ring to it.Tech Buzz Dell has released photos of their first ever mini laptop, meant to be a low-cost alternative for developing countries. The third world is always getting all the cool gadgets! This one should also be available here in June, starting at $399 (according to speculation).Tech Buzz A new version of Firefox is coming soon, and they’re hoping to set a Guinness Record for the most downloads in a single day. You can pledge to download here, or just wait until it’s out and then download it; the official date will be released soon.Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
