Submit your shitpile, including what you thinks its value is, and browse through other piles people are trying to unload. If Washington is buying toxic mortgage securities, maybe they’ll buy your old copies of Cat Fancy magazine.Contribute ›Politics Buzz 77-year-old ex-beauty queen claims to be John McCain’s former lover from 1957. She calls him her “coconut dessert” and says “Of course we had sex…he was not only good at kissing but good at everything.” It doesn’t make it any less gross that she sort of looks like a blond version of that scary old lady from Pet Cemetery.Contribute ›An unusually large diamond is found in Lesotho but it is nothing compared to “The Great Star of Africa” which still holds the record for largest diamond.Contribute ›Tech Buzz In a last ditch effort to revive itself, the music industry is introducing an alternative way of delivering music known as SlotMusic. 4 major record labels will be releasing select albums on 1GB Sandisk (SD) cards without Digital Rights Management (DRM). They’ll most likely sell for the same as a CD. Note to Sandisk and record labels, people steal music b/c it’s free not because of their aversion to the Compact Disc.Contribute ›http://eplay.typepad.com/eplay_online...Honda Motors grooved a Lancaster, CA highway to play part of the William Tell Overture as you drive over the road!.Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Twelve stolen pictures of Jamie Lynn Spears breast-feeding her baby has sparked a federal pornography investigation. Since Jamie Lynn is a minor, selling the pics (or buying them) could constitute a violation of federal laws prohibiting pornography. My question is, how is Jamie Lynne’s fiance stupid enough to take his camera to Wal-Mart to get his personal pics developed? Haven’t ya’ll heard of online digital printing down there in Louisiana?Contribute ›Style Buzz Tops with boob covers sewn into them seem to be all over the runways. The Agyness Deyn boob-patch shirt makes even her a bit hard on the eyes, but there were some more tasteful versions by other designers.Contribute ›Culture Buzz The Ask A Ninja creators released The Ninja Handbook, “the first-ever secret ninja training guide specifically designed for the non-ninja”. Since last week had International Talk Like A Pirate Day, let’s give the Ninjas some love today. Besides, could being in the International Order of Ninjas really be a bad thing?Contribute ›Culture Buzz Berkeley, California’s annual crazy parade takes place later this week, and will be replete with art cars and all of the city’s kookiest characters (read: everyone). The festival only further proves my thesis that Berkeley is the best place to play “Hobo or Hippie?” (via Laughing Squid)Contribute ›Michael Phelps will be joining the cast of Greys Anatomy this season as Dr. McSwimmey.Contribute ›If designers are the new rock stars then these these are the tats they would get. Look forward to designers sending complicated riders that request baby snow leopards long with their project bids.Contribute ›Politics Buzz The National Rifle Association launched their anti-Obama campaign today with ads that portray Obama as a gun-grabber who plans “a huge new tax” on “guns and ammo.” “He’s probably never been hunting a day in his life!” And he’s probably never accidentally shot and almost killed one of his good friends, either. I guess some of us view that as an actual good thing?Contribute ›In an attempt to counter protesters attempting to smear their “religion,” Scientologists planted fans to support Katie Holmes outside the theater in which she’s performing on Broadway.Contribute ›Last night’s Emmy Awards ceremony was mostly lackluster (thanks, Howie Mandel). Despite the 30 Rock sweep and Don Rickles riffing, there were only a small handful of enjoyable moments, the best by far being the stand-off between Ricky Gervais and Steve Carrell.Contribute ›Before Carrie Bradshaw and Gossip Girl, New York had its sh*t years, ridden with crime, bankruptcy, and violence. This vintage subway sticker, which warns commuters against the use of knives, guns, and bombs (!), brings to mind a simpler time when anyone with a vagina carried Mace, which - inevitably - had to be used it at least once.Contribute ›Tech Buzz Name your penis, get a certificate. It’s that easy! The rules state that names must not be vulgur or contain swear words. Maybe I should just go with one of those gutbusting Trust Me, I’m A Doctor tee shirts. (Get it? Because I’m not actually a doctor, but if my shirt says so, you’ll let me touch your private parts.)Contribute ›Obama or McCain?Contribute ›http://astore.amazon.com/bodybugg-20Bodybugg uses todays newest technology to give you the devices to achieve and maintain your goal weight.
