{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Culture Buzz A new ad campaign targeting men who father children with underage girls makes everyone feel uneasy (thanks for the tip!) These ads are disturbing, sure, but nowhere near as disturbing as the high incidence of statutory rape in Milwaukee, where they originated.View the 7 Best LinksPolitics Buzz A New York appeals court ruled on Friday that same-sex marriages performed in other states or countries must be recognized in New York, the first known ruling of its kind in the country. First the Superbowl, and now we get gay marriage too?? An amazing week.View the 9 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz First she flaunts a boob job, now she sings (on her new single \"Higher\"). What can\u0027t this girl do?View the 6 Best LinksBusiness Buzz Bill Gates\u0027 recent call for a \"kinder capitalism\" meets skepticism online. \"We have to find a way to make the aspects of capitalism that serve wealthier people serve poorer people as well,\" he told listeners at Davos. Will the Invisible Hand bring basic sanitation to the slums?View the 7 Best LinksSports Buzz Hot girlfriends might not be an asset as a sports star. Maybe this is why Roger Federer has dominated tennis for so long? Haha, kidding.View the 6 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Black Eyed Peas\u0027 Will.i.am comes out with a celeb-filled music video in support for Obama. The long list of celebrity appearances include: Scarlett Johansson, John Legend, Herbie Hancock, Kate Walsh, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Adam Rodriquez, Kelly Hu, Adam Rodriquez, Amber Valetta and Nick Cannon. Is \"Yes We Can\" the \"We Are the World\" for our generation? There\u0027s nothing like a Presidential election or an unusual drought to really bring everyone together.View the 9 Best LinksTech Buzz Recent outages in the Middle East give rise to conspiracy theories. How did the internet pipeline off the coast of Alexandria get severed? When the facts are sketchy, the internet conspiracy machine will be there to fill the holes! Current potential culprits: The CIA.View the 9 Best LinksTech Buzz PMOG, currently in private beta, is a Firefox add-on that lets you interact with other users asynchronously on websites you visit. It stands for \"passively multiplayer online game.\" What does all this mean? We think it means that your boss can leave virtual bombs for you every time you log into MySpace.View the 10 Best LinksTV Buzz Once again, violent antics and broad stereotypes win the day. Despite some assertions that this year\u0027s crop of ads would be kinder and gentler, the majority of Super Bowl spots couldn\u0027t help basing their jokes on brutal pratfalls and thinly veiled racist jokes. Here\u0027s a roundup of what you missed while replenishing your snacks.View the 26 Best LinksTech Buzz Wacky motorized rollerskates that go up to 20mph are now on the market for a mere $600. They look oddly like they\u0027re held together with silly putty and string. But we\u0027ll bet it won\u0027t be long before we see roving gangs of nerdy white guys sporting these.View the 8 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz Michael Jackson\u0027s three kids, Prince Michael, Prince Michael II aka \"Blanket,\" and Paris Katherine, have finally been photographed without their usual disguises and face coverings. We feel satisfied that we can now die knowing what Michael Jackson\u0027s kids look like. They\u0027re cute! (Thanks for the tip!)View the 6 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Super delegates may ultimately decide the Democratic nominee. Super delegates are the 796 unpledged delegates - most of them Democratic party officials - who can vote for whomever they want when it comes time to choose the Dem candidate at the national convention. With the primary race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama already so close, these delegates may become the deciding factor.View the 6 Best LinksMusic Buzz A tiny synthesizer that uses a touch pad instead of keys. Perfect for musicians used to using laptops and iPhones, the Kaossilator gets a surprising number of sounds out of a tiny package. Same cool-to-dorky ratio as the keytar.View the 5 Best LinksMusic Buzz U2 and Hannah Montana have 3D music movies hitting theaters. You know you wanna get stoned and go see Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: The Best of Both Worlds Concert at the IMAX.View the 6 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz In the midst of the current deluge of unhinged celebrities, there\u0027s one small glimmer of hope. Sean Young, Kirsten Dunst, Justin Chambers and Britney Spears: We know you\u0027re all having a hard time right now. Don\u0027t worry, guys, because as Natasha Lyonne proves, its possible to come back from anything.View the 7 Best LinksCulture Buzz The fake Nigerian soda behind this week\u0027s biggest viral video. So that \"bird poo in reporter\u0027s mouth\" everyone sent you this week was actually the first salvo in a very meta marketing campaign for Frumondah, a non-existent African soft drink. A new video from Bob Odenkirk explains the ties. Leaving us to wonder: How long until Frumondah joins the list of defictionalized goods?View the 5 Best LinksMusic Buzz French electro-clashers with a hit single about Scarlett Johansson come to America. With their dirty lyrics and Terry-Richardson-esque music video, these guys would be totally annoying if they were from Brooklyn. But since they\u0027re from France, that makes them okay. If you live in NYC, you can go see them this weekend! Lucky you.View the 10 Best LinksFood Buzz The Pickle Sickle is just that: A pickle in frozen popsicle form. Another potential \u002708 trend: Weird packaged food. Like the cheeseburger in a can, it\u0027s the pairing of an everyday foodstuff with a novel delivery system (in this case, a squishy tube) that makes the Pickle Sickle noteworthy, and also gross.View the 4 Best LinksTech Buzz A Microsoft/Yahoo deal would create a legion of weird new hybrids. Mircosoft Del.ici.ous, anyone? How about Hot Yahoo Mail? We can\u0027t really get what $44.6 billion looks like, but we could imagine the bad things Microsoft could do to Flickr. Hence our personal favorite anagram of both company names: Hot, Roomy Fiasco.View the 6 Best LinksMusic Buzz Legendary actor and activist Bill Cosby will release a rap album called “State Of Emergency” that is completely free of profanity. Upon hearing Bill Cosby do the Pokemon song, we have high hopes that his rap album could reach epic R. Kelly-caliber proportions.View the 9 Best LinksPolitics Buzz If John McCain turns out to be the Republican Presidential nominee, Ann Coulter says she\u0027d rather have Hillary as President. She would even go so far as to campaign for her. Is this a sign of the apocalypse? Or is Ann Coulter more \"hos before bros\" than we thought?View the 8 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz The actress stirs up the controversy about her heritage again. She offended many members of the Latino community last year by claiming \"it would be insincere\" to call her \"a Latin actress.\" Now, as the Latina cover girl, she says, \"No one gives Cameron Diaz a hard time for not speaking Spanish.\"View the 8 Best LinksTech Buzz The Jelly Click is an extremely portable, travel-friendly computer mouse that you can blow up or deflate at whim. We want to think the Jelly Click forecasts a big trend that we feel will be big in \u002708: inflatable furniture! It\u0027s 1992 all over again.View the 5 Best LinksStyle Buzz Who says skirts on men can\u0027t be practical? Nice to see that kilts have extended beyond the traditional plaid, embracing khaki, camo and even denim designs. It\u0027s not too early to start ordering to make sure you get yours in time for the Spring 2008 renaissance faire season.View the 6 Best LinksTech Buzz A bare-bones bookmarking tool for those too busy to read. A nifty little tool from one of the guys behind Tumblr. Yes, we know bookmarking technology isn\u0027t exactly ground-breaking; Instapaper just does it more elegantly than anyone else.View the 8 Best LinksCulture Buzz Italy\u0027s art models are going on strike and asking for better pay and better working conditions. And they\u0027re raising awareness of what a thankless job posing nude for the sake of art is. We might be more sympathetic to their cause if they were actually protesting in the nude.View the 5 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Everyone\u0027s least-favorite transportation authority is trying to reach out to the bloggers. Will the TSA write about how fun it is to blog, then about their day, then about this boy they met? Will they eventually start doing those \"sorry we haven\u0027t posted in a while\" entries? A nation waits breathlessly to find out.View the 6 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Toni Morrison and Alice Walker get behind Obama; Maya Angelou, Anne Rice and John Grisham support Clinton. Because having macho men endorse your campaign just isn\u0027t enough.View the 6 Best LinksCulture Buzz The opera based on the trashy TV talk show gets rave reviews as it opens in NYC this week.
