{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Politics Buzz A voter question at a West Virginia campaign stop has once again caused Hillary Clinton’s partner to let his anger boil over. Is he bringing down Hillary and/or damaging his own legacy? Who knows, but he sure seems stressed out.Tech Buzz A popular search engine for video that uses speech-recognition software to enhance results. Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation and Google are both rumored to be looking into buying the company before it goes public.Movie Buzz Troma team churns out a movie that’s being called a “satirical sexploitation zombie chicken gross-out musical extravaganza.” Please watch the trailer. Bizarre sex acts and explosive diarrhea make this movie a must-see, but the best part is, you can justify all the mindless schlock because it is actually socio-political commentary on the fast food industry.Politics Buzz It’s the new Barack Obama is your new bicycle. Inspired by the Twitter chatter on how the world will be forever changed when Obama wins, Jason Kottke makes a microsite to share that utopian vision.Culture Buzz A golden retriever is born in New Orleans with green fur. The puppy is supposedly healthy, with fur that will turn white or tan in a few weeks. Awww. This puppy is such an adorable shade of phlegm green. But it’s still not okay when crazy old ladies dye their poodles pink.Culture Buzz It’s Mother’s Day on Sunday. What have you done for your mom recently? We were going to put together a heart-warming tribute to moms, but instead we found a group of sites doing a variation on the Your Mom joke theme.Style Buzz Singer Beyoncé’s fashion line, House of Dereon, has created a collection for young girls. The controversial ad campaign features preschoolers in four inch heels, feather boas and looking generally trashy. I can only imagine how terrifying of the House of Dereon Baby collection must be.Food Buzz A Georgia senator named Doug Stoner wants to ban the sale of marijuana-flavored candy. It’s hard to say we’re going to miss a product that we never even knew existed. But now that we know it does, where can we get some??Food Buzz Beyond the ubiquitous International Thumbs Up Guy, there’s a whole world of weird food statues out there. The New York Times has a quick look at phenomenon of eerie fiberglass food vendor statues from around the globe. The hot dog guy always makes me feel a little sick with the way he spurts mustard and ketchup on himself; he’s included with other disturbing examples I’ve found.Movie Buzz The Hillary Downfall video is but the latest in a long series of Hitler videos that rely on subtitles for the jokes. Der Untergang, a German movie about the last days of Hitler, came out in 2004. In August 2006, YouTube user DReaperF4 posted a Spanish-language satire using the movie’s pivotal scene, wherein Hitler finally realizes the war is lost, with subtitles about the release of a new flight simulator game. An English version followed, and then imitators with jokes about Hitler’s car being stolen, Hitler being banned from XBox Live, Hitler being angry about the Patriot’s Super Bowl loss — and now, Hitler as Hillary, angry about the superdelegates.Science Buzz Dissolving bodies with lye, which has been used to get rid of animal carcasses for years, is being touted as the green alternative to burial and cremation. Burial is expensive, and cremation can be sacrilegious (someone could try to smoke or snort your ashes). The third option of dissolution could become a viable, environmentally-conscious form of corpse removal.Culture Buzz President Bush is in the news once again, but only because his daughter’s getting married in Texas. We wonder what kind of nickname he’s given his soon-to-be son-in-law.Style Buzz New York Times has a piece on the latest trend in environmentally-conscious home furnishing: furniture that disappears when you’re done with it. Here’s an idea that could really take off, especially when it seems like so much furniture from IKEA is practically disposable. It pained me to have to throw out so much stuff when I decided I didn’t want to live like I was in a college dormitory anymore.Politics Buzz Now that it’s almost impossible for Hillary Clinton to win the Democratic nomination by any reasonable measure, political writers are saying she may as well quit. More than a few of them have begun collecting the reasons into the popular “list” format.Movie Buzz Someone’s compiled a video of the best moments from this biopic, starring Willa Ford. In the grand tradition of Oscar-worthy biopics like Ray and Walk the Line, this is pretty much the most anticipated movie of the year.Movie Buzz The animated new Star Wars movie comes out August 15th, but the poster and trailer have been released this week. The 3D animation looks kind of blocky, but at least we won’t have to put up with any bad acting.Movie Buzz Nick Broomfield’s movie about one corner of the Iraq War finally comes to the U.S. The Haditha killings were one of the worst civilian casualty incidents of the war — 24 men, women and children were killed by a group of Marines after a roadside bombing, though all charges against the soldiers involved were dropped after an investigation. The movie looks at what happened from several different angles.Style Buzz Blogger Perez Hilton is debuting a clothing line with Hot Topic. Look forward to Perezcious Pink t-shirts, hoodies, accessories and footwear. There is also Gossip Ganster flip flops, and some sort of lipgloss. I’m wondering if the lipgloss can be used to create that lovely white drool, or coke nose effect that Perez seem to do in MS Paint.Food Buzz A pan that makes perfectly round pancake puffs that can be filled with anything, from hot dogs to jam. The part during the infomercial where they inject the pancake with beef gravy just made my mouth water. And just think of the amazing brunch you’ll be able to make for your friends with this thing.Culture Buzz These are the lists men should know about, even if they don’t know how to do half the things on them.
