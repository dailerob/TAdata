{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Music Buzz Two Brooklyn-based, Milwaukee-bred brothers that combine perky electropop with - gasp! - actual instrumentation, namely via the French Horn. Between the groveling hipsters and pride-filled band teachers who undoubtedly fill the rooms at their shows, trying to figure out whose stonewashed jeans are ironic and whose were on sale at Costco has to be one of the most fun - albeit challenging - games ever. Contribute ›High school football player Sam McGuffie became a sensation after The Hurdle and MCGUFFIE MIXTAPE! hit YouTube. Contribute ›A thank you note from Marilyn Monroe for a bottle of champagne is just one of 586 of her dearest belongings that have recently surfaced. Contribute ›Culture Buzz About a year ago, Levinator25 uploaded footage of an in-game glitch allowing Tiger Woods to walk on water, and make the so-called “Jesus Shot”. Last week, EA responded with a video of their own showing Tiger Woods doing just that, claiming, “It’s not a glitch. He’s just that good.” Viral marketing, meet mainstream America. Levinator25, you just got pwned. Contribute ›Wide receiver Chad Johnson legally changes his name to “OchoCinco” - the rough Spanish translation of his jersey number 85. Contribute ›Politics Buzz In what has quickly become a mini-meme among Battlestar Galactica aficionados, John McCain and Sarah Palin are being closely compared - both in appearance and political profile - to two of the show’s main characters, troubled alien Col. Tigh and feisty President Laura Roslin. If you ask me, the only “toaster” trotting around Washington has got to be Laura Frakking Bush. As far as I’m concerned, she’s got nothing but two dead eyes, a pained smile, and some excellent inner wiring. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Five years after his father’s body was initially found and cremated (without the authorities conducting an actual DNA test), one man witnessed his dad alive and well…on daytime TV! It’s quite an amazing story, especially now that John Renehan has reunited with his father, helping him piece together his past. Less amazing? An urn filled with the ashes of a stranger. That’s, like, begging for nightmares. Contribute ›Culture Buzz The Church of England may start a chain of wine bars to update their brand and attract new worshipers. The bars would be decorated with stained glass and “episcopal purple.” No word yet on whether the wine would be made out of water on site, or just, you know, purchased in bottles. Contribute ›Food Buzz If you’re going to watch the VMA’s on Sunday, better whip up a batch of Britney’s famous Cheetos chicken casserole. Everyone knows celebrities don’t cook for themselves! I just wanted an excuse to post Britney’s Cheetos chicken casserole recipe and see if anyone had the balls to actually make it (and then eat it). Contribute ›A resort island in Germany builds a house aptly named ‘The World Stands on Its Head.’ Contribute ›Culture Buzz From a BBC public service campaign to promote condom use in India, it’s…a downloadable ringtone consisting of people repeatedly singing the word “condom.” It’s part Mozart chorale, part barbershop quartet, entirely amazing. And no, I can’t explain the parrot. Contribute ›Politics Buzz Nancy and Ann Wilson, John Cougar/Cougar-Mellencamp/Mellencamp, Van Halen and Jackson Brown ask McCain to stop using their music. Seems the Republicans can’t even steal their way out of their white stodginess. I say all for the better. If I see one more Democrat dancing to Fleetwood Mac I’m gonna slit my wrists with a cracked Rumors LP. Contribute ›Culture Buzz People share their stories about the clothes they wore the last time they had sex. How much does your outfit affect your game? Seems like if you’re drunk enough, a pair of crocs could easily be mistaken for some sexy Louboutin pumps. Contribute ›Culture Buzz A new exhibit at the Museum of Sex is a celebration of the “diversity of animal sexual behavior”. This statue of the Deersome is just one of many amazing animal sexual experiences that are on display at the museum. It’s like if all the humping animals I ever saw on TV crept out of my dreams, only to coalesce in one place. Naturally, that’s New York City baby. Contribute ›Movie Buzz Two producers from ‘The Office’ are writing the script for ‘Ghostbusters 3.’ The sequel will reunite the original cast, and the Judd Apatow cabal may be involved in some way that I’m too excited to understand in detail. Ghostbusters! Yay! Contribute ›A chart from Wired in 2005 shows how Star Wars influenced the later development of movies, games, TV programs, and other forms of entertainment. Contribute ›Rumor has it Us Weekly is losing subscribers over this cover story on Sarah Palin. Contribute ›A Radaronline editor just happened to be at a Las Vegas strip club, where he managed to get some shots of Michael Phelps grabbing some stipper’s ass. Contribute ›Food Buzz The brewing discontent of the cupcake-haters. We’ve already seen them banned in schools. Will the expansion of Crumbs, a cupcake place that’s growing at a Krispy Kreme-like pace, turn more people against the lowly cupcake? Contribute ›Politics Buzz A Republican Congressman calls the Obamas part of an elite, “uppity” class of liberals. Oh, the irony. Next up, we’ll be discussing Cindy McCain’s modest yet humble $300,000 dress. Contribute ›Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
