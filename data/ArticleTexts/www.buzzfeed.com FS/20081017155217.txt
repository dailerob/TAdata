We love Tompkins, but may we nominate BWE.tv’s Managing Editor, Michelle Collins? She is, indeed, a friend, but also the funniest lady in the world!Contribute ›Science Buzz Using Playboy photos from 1960 to 2000, a new study maps age and physical measurements of Playmates to the socio-economic conditions of the times.

But is there a FAIL backlash on the horizon? Even crappy verbage like LOL has survived the test of time. So WTF? Why not FAIL?8 Responses · Add Yours ›Celebrity Buzz Rachelle Leah is a UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) host and Novembers Playboy cover girl. She’s known as UFC’s most popular and hottest octagon girl (the girl who carries the card around the cage during matches) and Yahoo swears she’s more than just a pretty face. Beautiful, talented, and smart. She’s got it all.2 Responses · Add Yours ›Movie Buzz Today, Entertainment Weekly released images from its upcoming issue devoted to J.J. Abrams’s remake of Star Trek, starring Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine. It’s definitely a younger, hipper Star Trek cast than the one you’re used to.Contribute ›Movie Buzz Steven Soderbergh’s next movie, about a high-class call girl, will star porn star Sasha Grey.
