{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tech Buzz The various diets of internet entrepreneurs, hackers, and geeks. (Thanks to Mark for the tip!) People are so concerned over the underweight models in the fashion industry, but no one seems to care about those spindly-thin hackers and UNIX geeks, wasting away in dark basements. You too can unencrypt their secret to weight loss, without taking a single computer science course (unless, of course, you need some thinspo).View the 8 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz Sudden increase in dog stealing in America and England. This is the kind of heartbreaking trend that pains us to report. But if you\u0027re Paris Hilton, you can actually view this as a cute-dog upgrade.View the 8 Best LinksPolitical Buzz Ann Coulter calls John Edwards a \"faggot,\" manages to turn conservatives against her. We didn\u0027t want to give Ann more publicity than she deserves. But then we found that picture with the adam\u0027s apple and it was all just too perfect, like puzzle pieces sent from God.View the 12 Best LinksTV Buzz Jack Black\u0027s new VH1 interactive user-controlled program. VH1 is watchable again! Is The Agency totally the best show or what?? It\u0027s like America\u0027s Next Top Model but not retarded. Anyway, this show is hosted by Jack Black, meaning it\u0027s kind of like the opposite of The Agency but in a good way. We\u0027re too lazy to actually \"interact\" with anything, but the show looks like good times.View the 7 Best LinksFashion Buzz Alison Kelly of Project Runway fame\u0027s new clothing line. Oh, we all want a little piece of Alison Kelly. The next best thing would be to own one of her cute flirty dresses, which are somewhat affordable (depending on how poor you are) from shopbop.com.View the 9 Best LinksPolitical Buzz Swiss Soldiers accidentally invade Liechtenstein during a routine training exercise. Leave it to those ditzy Swiss people to pull the ultimate \"tee-hee!\" This is perhaps the first time a military invasion made me stop and say, \"Awwww.\"View the 8 Best LinksArts/Culture Buzz Associated Press\u0027 week-long experimental ban on all Paris Hilton news was a journalistic feat. Hmm. We did this, too. For an entire DAY (February 27th, 2007, to be exact, if you wanted to be nitpicky and check the archives), we didn\u0027t cover a single trend on porn, Jews, Blacks, or Gays. The result? Devastatingly, suicidally low traffic. So yeah. Make sure to keep reading Buzzfeed if you love sex and/or racism.View the 7 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz The new exercise class that\u0027s pretty much freestyle dancing. It\u0027s the new Curves, but with fewer old fat housewives. Get hot and sweaty with your girlfriends to today\u0027s hits (the Knife, M.I.A., etc). The best part about it is that there\u0027s no need to get hussied up with your cleavage-baring tops and Laboutin heels to see who can pick up that hot boy across the room. The worst part about it is that there\u0027s no hot boy across the room to pick up.View the 9 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz \"That\u0027s so gay\" prompts student lawsuit. When I first saw this headline, I thought it was going to be an amazing new sitcom on ABC Family. Unfortunately, it is just a news story that everyone will probably forget in 2 hours.View the 10 Best LinksPolitical Buzz John McCain warns that he\u0027s going to run for President. It\u0027s like the grand entrance on My Super Sweet Sixteen but slightly more anti-climactic. People just don\u0027t care unless you take your sweeeeeet ass time to do something they know you\u0027re going to do anyway. Whoever announces their candidacy in 12 steps or less wins!View the 6 Best LinksPolitical Buzz John Kerry questions Sam Fox, who was a Swift Boat benefactor, about his $50k donation in 2004. You only wish you had this problem! Sam Fox is like Lindsay Lohan on a shopping spree, except with controversial political donations instead of Balenciaga handbags.View the 6 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz Asses come in all shapes and sizes. Here is a roundup of the lesser-endowed. The way this word euphoniously slides off the tongue is absolutely delectable, unlike it\u0027s actual meaning. We\u0027d write more, but it\u0027s hard to type and do squats at the same time.View the 9 Best LinksTV Buzz Last night\u0027s premiere of Cycle 8 of America\u0027s Next Top Model provided further insight and evidence. A reader earnestly asked, \"Tyra Banks is consistently crazy. How come she is never covered here?\" That\u0027s a good question. Secretly, it\u0027s because we are too lazy to compile the hundreds of blog posts dedicated to this subject, and knew it would take over 3 full hours of half-assed Google searches and atleast 2 lines of coke. But, thanks for calling us out on it. Here it is.View the 25 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz First smoking in bars, then trans fat, now the N word. Life in NYC is starting to feel so empty. It would feel like a fascist state, except no matter where you are, there is a giant American Apparel billboard looming over you, reminding you that we really are still free.View the 7 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz For each virtual donation, Seventh Generation will send a pack of organic cotton tampons to a shelter in your state. Tampons and maxi pads should be socialized! EVERY woman needs them and plus, that stuff is kind of expensive. Feminine hygeine products are always an overlooked necessity, so this is a great idea that requires very minimal effort on your part.View the 5 Best LinksLooking for more?
