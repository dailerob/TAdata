Following in the footsteps of Carrell, Colbert, Helms, and Corddry, Schaal has been handed a highly coveted opportunity in the comedy world. We\u0027re thrilled to see her get some exclusive face time, although we wouldn\u0027t complain if Comedy Central canned Mind of Mencia in favor of Penelope: Princess Of Pets, too.View the 10 Best LinksStyle Buzz The original Muppet teamed with famed photog Terry Richardson for the skater-friendly retailer Supreme. Luckily, Kermit\u0027s cuteness was safeguarded by the usually NSFW Richardson. Had he gotten his hands on Prairie Dawn, however, things would likely have gone differently (\u0027cuz everyone knows that chick is a freeeeeak).View the 8 Best LinksStyle Buzz LiLo is working on her own line of signature legwear. Always on the lookout for new ways to avoid wearing pants, the actress says of her soon-to-be-released leggings that \"some will have prints and some will have patterns.\" We\u0027re hoping she designed them specifically to accommodate alcohol monitoring anklets.View the 9 Best LinksBusiness Buzz The Fed and JPMorgan are bailing out the investment bank during it\u0027s \"grave liquidity crisis.\" Does this have something to do with those subprime mortgages that used to be so popular? Yes. We had a liquidity crisis the other night at a bar, but we blamed it on someone else.View the 6 Best LinksStyle Buzz Celebs are swapping their black and white Wayfarer sunglasses in for bright colors. Maybe because it\u0027s almost spring, maybe because everyone wants to impress Kanye West, maybe there\u0027s no real explanation, but loud Wayfarers are everywhere these days.View the 8 Best LinksScience Buzz It\u0027s March 14, time to celebrate everybody\u0027s favorite irrational mathematical constant. If today is Pi Day, does that make 1:59 Pi Minute? Yes, it does. It\u0027s the 20th anniversary of Pi Day today (any connection with other anniversaries?) and math nerds couldn\u0027t be happier.View the 6 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz A new video is leaked, just in time for Scientology Day! Gawker has a new Tom Cruise Scientology video - this one shows his extravagant birthday tribute on a boat, complete with Scientology bigwigs, a band, a video tribute and an impromptu, Risky Business-style performance of Old Time Rock and Roll by Cruise.View the 5 Best LinksSports Buzz Intercollegiate meat judging is a real sport involving hours of meat quality analysis amongst college teams. Fasten your hairnets! There\u0027s a giant meat industry out there, aiming to pluck the nation\u0027s youngest, brightest carcass experts. We assume this is one of those \"only in America\" things.View the 5 Best LinksTech Buzz Google opens its web-based star viewer. This will come in handy when you need directions from that 7-11 on Broadway to the Horseshoe Nebula.View the 6 Best LinksTech Buzz With Kottke.org turning ten, the blogosphere is slowly going grey. Expect a lot more posts about polyester slacks, the \"good old days\" and how tasty soup is. (We kid because we love! Congrats, Jason.)View the 4 Best LinksScience Buzz The drinkpeedrinkpeedrinkpee installation at the Eyebeam art and technology center in New York City explores the role our bodies play in the larger ecosystems. Building on the scatalogical analysis trend, visitors will be invited to sit on a toilet facing a water fountain simulating drinking and peeing at the same time; also, a DIY kit for turning your pee into fertilizer will be available as a souvenir.View the 6 Best LinksMusic Buzz Indie singer Jill Sobule set up a telethon style website to raise $75,000 for her next album. The \"I Kissed a Girl\" singer offered tiered prizes for the donations, with $10 winning you a digital download, a mention on an instrumental track for $500, your own theme song for $1000, and a chance to sing on the record for $10,000. She succeeded in raising the money in 53 days.View the 10 Best LinksCulture Buzz The new 5-spot, with brighter colors and anti-counterfeiting measures, has been released to the public. The watermarks are cool, the colors are fresh and we like the attention to the small details.View the 5 Best LinksMovie Buzz The good news of a teaser trailer is offset by rumors of Ed Norton feuding with Marvel over the cut of the film. The teaser makes the film look like a very different beast than the Ang Lee version of a few years ago. But Ed Norton\u0027s reportedly none too happy with the way the final cut is headed and he and Marvel have been sparring over it.View the 5 Best LinksPolitics Buzz A recent anti-gay tirade from Oklahoma State Representative Sally Kern ended up on YouTube. WHOOPS! Among other left-field remarks, Kern claims \"studies show that no society that has totally embraced homosexuality has lasted more than a few decades.\" She failed to mention, of course, that these studies were conducted solely by Sally Kern\u0027s brain, and that their subjects were a tribe of effete leprechauns.View the 7 Best LinksTV Buzz In the age of DVDs and DVRs, what roles do spoilers play? In a pro-watercooler piece, New York magazine argues that watching TV shows these days should feel more like watching sports: See it live, or risk finding out the final score without seeing the game.View the 4 Best LinksTV Buzz The creator of Veronica Mars is reportedly helming a spinoff of the \u002790s teen soap for The CW. If there is, in fact, a God, Brenda and Dylan will totes be running the Peach Pit, dispensing advice and milkshakes as needed to some very troubled teenagers.View the 6 Best LinksTV Buzz Charming, adorable, and an undeniably gifted singer, he\u0027s this year\u0027s American Idol favorite to win. Somewhere, Ruben Studdard is staring into a mirror, wishing he, too, looked 15 years younger and 150 pounds lighter.View the 8 Best LinksStyle Buzz The \u002780s are back! And so are perms. We don\u0027t usually like to make broad sweeping statements like \"curly hair is in!\" but jheri curls for Asians seemed a little too specific.View the 6 Best LinksMovie Buzz The rubber room in the NYC public school district is where they send teachers who get in trouble, but not enough to fire them. It\u0027s also the subject of a new documentary that looks pretty interesting and is currently trying to amass funding. It\u0027s like purgatory for teachers. Kind of like how high school is hell for teenagers.View the 6 Best LinksFood Buzz Lollipops now come in intriguing flavors like marijuana, absinthe, and maple bacon. For those of you without a sweet tooth, there\u0027s this new trend of salty candy. We always kind of favored those popcorn-flavored jelly beans.View the 8 Best LinksPolitics Buzz A six-year-old girl was fined $300 for drawing on the sidewalk in front of her home with colored chalk. Stephen Colbert interviewed Natalie Shea the \"calcium sulfate junkie\" and was able to draw correlations between her vandalism, the decline in Brooklyn property values and the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Apparently chalkitti is considered a gateway crime since it literally happened a couple steps from the gate to Shea\u0027s Park Slope brownstone.View the 9 Best LinksCulture Buzz Youth advocates are none too happy about a children\u0027s hospital in Ohio set to be named after Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch, following the retailer\u0027s donation of $10 million to their Emergency and Trauma department. In spite of Abercrombie\u0027s hypersexualized reputation, everyone should bear in mind that \"sexy nurses\" only come out at Halloween. During the rest of the year, it\u0027s nothing but teddy bear scrubs and cigarette breath, likely to force no child into early puberty.View the 9 Best LinksScience Buzz It\u0027s a nice, scientific name for the dissection of poo in order to diagnose ailments. You read your horoscope every day. So why not study up on some scatalogy?

Stop by the Chashama Gallery on 44th street and have your photo taken, and see it appear on an enormous billboard hanging 48 stories up 15 minutes later. Artist Raul Vincent Enriquez says it\u0027s all about eye contact.View the 6 Best LinksMovie Buzz Corey Feldman returns in a remake designed to line his pockets with cash. Hey, it\u0027s that girl from The O.C. And...Corey Feldman! And a over-produced cover of Cry, Little Sister. On the plus side, everybody loves a vampire flick.View the 5 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Debate rages on about whether Eliot Spitzer\u0027s wife should have stood by her man amidst hooker crisis. She probably feels like sh*t because her husband was hanging out with a hooker on Valentine\u0027s Day. Let\u0027s try to cheer her up! (Pictured: happier times.)View the 8 Best LinksBuzz Archive ?
