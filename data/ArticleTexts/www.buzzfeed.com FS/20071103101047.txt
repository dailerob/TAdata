So, the rumor is that they are dating each other. Because that is too hard for us to comprehend, we\u0027re going to assume it\u0027s some kind of viral marketing stunt that will somehow end in Lance winning yet another Tour de France.View the 10 Best LinksFood Buzz Batter Blaster brings you pressurized pancakes in a can (yes, they\u0027re real).

Rowling\u0027s first post-Harry-Potter book will be a collection of magical fairy tales. But fans will be disappointed to find out only 7 copies exist, and they\u0027ll be auctioned off for charity.
