That’s when the killer appeared at the door, said a witness: “While we were watching the door, he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us.”The Boring couple was just trying to live their boring life when Google Street View ruined everything.Style Buzz Round beds are actually kind of popular in Europe.
