The Most Adorable Girl in the World can also sing and stuff. No, we\u0027re not jealous at all.View the 8 Best LinksTV Buzz Fox\u0027s ratings juggernaut returns. No more Sanjaya, and, with the writers\u0027 strike still going on, hardly any competition. The cringe-inducing audition episodes start on Tuesday.View the 6 Best LinksCulture Buzz In the UK, the largest practical conservation charity in the country is organizing “eco-dating” for singles. Instead of a bouquet of flowers, standard date protocol would be to bring your date a toilet brick.View the 7 Best LinksScience Buzz German zookeepers sweep in to save the life of an adorable polar bear. While lil\u0027 bears are deliciously cute, we don\u0027t actually think they\u0027d be delicious. Some mother bears seem to think otherwise. They\u0027re hardly alone in the animal kingdom, where infanticide is as popular as stage-mothering is among humans.View the 5 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz Here\u0027s a round-up of famous people with famously bad teeth. They can afford a good orthodontist, but sometimes not even the best in the business can fix a bad case of meth mouth. (Thanks for the tip!)View the 9 Best LinksBusiness Buzz Wesley Snipes says Americans don\u0027t have to pay taxes (which is why he didn\u0027t). Snipes didn\u0027t pay a dime towards tax on the $38 million he made between 1999-2004, and at his trial will argue he isn\u0027t required to do so. It\u0027s an anti-tax argument known as the 861 Position, after a portion of the tax code that defines taxable sources of income. Kooky court behavior, sure, but it\u0027s better than having the feds surround your compound.View the 7 Best LinksTech Buzz The rumors are circulating about Apple\u0027s new ultra-thin portable laptop. Computer geeks might just be the most impatient people on the planet. We\u0027ll just sit back and watch them piece it all together for us.View the 12 Best LinksTV Buzz The man behind Cloverfield, Lost, and the upcoming Star Trek movie has never opened this box, given to him 15 years ago. While the box allegedly reminds Abrams of the power of simple ideas untouched by technology, we think we may finally know where the remaining copies of the Felicity series finale are hiding.View the 5 Best LinksFood Buzz In Peru and Ecuador, chefs serve up guinea pigs as a popular delicacy. You can actually find it in some places in the U.S. (and no, we don\u0027t mean at PetSmart). Rumors are that a Houston, Texas, company will begin importing cuy meat sometime in the near future.View the 8 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Wyclef Jean and Timbaland are named in an on-going steroid investigation. A report in the Albany Times Union alleges those stars (and others) were recipients of steroids and growth hormones. But don\u0027t worry, apparently using steroids isn\u0027t a big issue if you aren\u0027t a professional athlete, and none of the big names are going to jail.View the 4 Best LinksTech Buzz The tech site\u0027s bloggers went around turning off TVs during the electronics expo, mayhem ensued. When did electronics expos become so much like high school? Other bloggers are now worried they\u0027ll be banned from CES next year, and are calling for blood. It\u0027s all thanks to TV-B-Gone.View the 8 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz After what seems like about 11 months of pregnancy, professional starlet Nicole Richie goes into labor, while Christina Aguilera is reportedly at the same hospital, also ready to pop.

As far as we can tell, this sport\u0027s not exactly new, but it\u0027s enjoying a renaissance as hipsters tire of ping pong.View the 8 Best LinksScience Buzz Scientists measure the biggest black hole in the known Universe. This is how we imagine the announcement went - Scientist: Our black hole is so big... Audience (in unison): How big is it??? Scientist: It\u0027s so big...um, it\u0027s so big that it weighs the same as 18 billion suns, combined.View the 5 Best LinksPolitics Buzz Democratic Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich has called for a New Hampshire recount in the \"interest of election integrity.\" Why won\u0027t anyone ever take Dennis Kucinich seriously?

He was reportedly converted to the cult-like religion by buddy Tom Cruise, and the two now plan on spending more time together doing normal things that Scientologists do, like fearing the wrath of a dangerously low Thetan level and not making out with other dudes.View the 8 Best LinksStyle Buzz Stylish passport wallets - kinda metro, kinda practical.

Transformers\u0027 Megan Fox will star as a cheerleader who is possessed by a demon and starts eating all the boys in town. Sounds sort of like Heathers meets The Exorcist—or Juno, if Juno was a cannibal.View the 8 Best LinksStyle Buzz Rings imprinted with crests and carvings are the new cocktail ring.
