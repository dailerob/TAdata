{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Movie Buzz The prolific reviewer tackles a new medium. The casual tone of the blog, the snippets of thought and asides will no doubt go over big with Ebert fans. And haters will get all internet-angry in the comments section.Culture Buzz If you’re rich, your pets should think they are, too. No expense of construction or pet-sustaining technology should be spared! Actually, a lot of these seem like they would just freak most dogs out.TV Buzz The buzz surrounding Joss Whedon’s new sci-fi series Dollhouse is building, as fansites pop up and script pages are leaked. This show doesn’t even exist yet, but rabid fans are already collecting every single tiny minute remnant of news and speculation surrounding it. Here’s my attempt at gathering the pieces.Style Buzz Designers like Alexander Wang and Marni are featuring backpacks in their Fall/Winter 2008 collections in fabrics like sequins and fur. In my attempt at eschewing the giant IT bag, I recently got one of these cute Swedish backpacks. It fits my laptop, and looks like something a Scandinavian schoolchild would wear.Culture Buzz The most boring is also the most AWESOME!!! It’s like the heroin addict’s lean but cuter!!!!!Culture Buzz A group of private investigators say they’re able to link up dozens of seemingly unrelated deaths of college men through a common clue: Smiley faces found near where the drowned bodies were found. The deaths (murders?) all share common traits: Well-liked, athletic college guys who drowned mysteriously, usually disappearing after a night of drinking. The drownings are usually chalked up as accidents, but two former New York cops say they’ve found links that make them look more like murders, and they hypothesize that a sinister group of killers is behind them all.Culture Buzz Posing as a 10-year-old boy, pop culture historian Bill Geerhart wrote letters to iconic politicians and murderers, and they all wrote back including Charles Manson and Dick Cheney. It’s like Dear Mr. Henshaw for the cold-blooded set.Politics Buzz Rush Limbaugh urges his conservative fans to vote for Hillary so that neither Democrat can win the primaries. In Limbaugh’s own words: “The endgame is to see that neither of these candidates can win by virtue of the primaries” assuring that Hillary and Barack “will be so bloodied and brought down to earth that neither can win in the general.” A few outside observers think that Operation Chaos is actually working while others are skeptical. Of course, Rush is happy to take full credit for the current Obama Clinton fatigueCulture Buzz A Los Angeles porn company is planning to release a 45-minute DVD with footage of guitar legend Jimi Hendrix having sex with two women. Like the Marilyn Monroe sex tape, the authenticity of the footage is being hotly contested. Yet another sex tape from the dead. It’ll either make you want to have sex, or hold a seance.Tech Buzz The sex in the new version of Grand Theft Auto isn’t even hidden. Apparently the video games rating board saw and signed off on all the simulated sex in Grand Theft Auto IV. That isn’t stopping one of the game’s chief foes, Jack Thompson, is trying to get the game pulled from the shelves.Style Buzz April issue of Flair magazine has a spread featuring model Flavia Oliveira smoking Nat Sherman Fantasia cigarettes in bright, spring-colored hues. I just can’t think of a more glamorous or self-destructive way to accessorize an outfit.Politics Buzz Bloggers are urging women to send their resumes to Senator McCain in response to his comment that women need more “education and training” if they want equal pay. After Senate Republicans blocked the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act last Wednesday, McCain (who failed to even show up for the vote) blames the wage gap on lack of education. Since 58% of college graduates are women, maybe McCain needs more education on the issue?Culture Buzz You may want to return that one-way ticket to the Congo, as sorcerers of black magic have been making penises shrink or - worse - disappear. Having lead to violent outbreaks and lynchings, this bit of odd news isn’t to be taken lightly. However, if someone can simply find a sorcerer whose magic touch will reverse the spell, won’t that make everyone happy?Culture Buzz A stamp that’s good for mailing one-ounce First-Class letters anytime in the future - regardless of price changes. Buy yours now for 41 cents before the postage rate increases to 42 cents on May 12th. Apparently, they’ve been selling like hotcakes for the past year, especially amongst the penny-pinching, letter-writing set.Celebrity Buzz Gen X is poised for a vicarious mid-life crisis as their favorite pop stars all turn 50 this year. We all know that the Rolling Stones are rockin’ their golden years. But now a new generation can lament the graying of their childhood icons. All three stars still look good, but Michael Jackson looks freakin’ AMAZING. Must be the oxygen tent and youthful lifestyle.Sports Buzz Speed Racer fans can channel their racing enthusiasm into something concrete: The team behind the North American Eagle is trying to break the world landspeed record, and they need a driver. It could be you! Just send an email - 400 words about your racing background, and a photo - to landspeedracing@gmail.com, and you could become the face (and driver) of the North American Eagle team’s effort to bring the record back to continent for the first time since 1983.Sports Buzz Baseball pitching great Roger Clemens had a 10-year affair with country singer Mindy McCready that began when she was 15-years-old. What better way to launch a career than a giant sex scandal? She’s working on a documentary, as well as staging a comeback with a reality show and a new album. It’s been a while since someone wrote a catchy tune about statutory rape.Style Buzz The high-concept sunglasses by Linda Farrow are pushing the eyewear envelope. The line has collaborated with big name designers including Jeremy Scott, Luella, Dries Van Noten and Chloe Sevigny. Although the Beak Glasses are pretty out there, I am kind of loving the Minnie Mouse look of the Jeremy Scott glasses pictured.Culture Buzz WNYC and PRI have launched a new national morning radio news show. It’s taking on NPR’s “Morning Edition,” with a different slant on what a morning news show should be in the internet era.Style Buzz Dutch architects invent a window frame that can be extended into a balcony. I could see these being totally ubiquitous and being sold at an IKEA near you. There was probably a time when sofabeds seemed really ingenious and innovative.Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
