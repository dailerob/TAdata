{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Culture Buzz Photographer Lisa Rastl piles people up in unexpected locations. I guess you never really expect to see people piled up anywhere, really. These images all have a real charm about them. Contribute ›Politics Buzz He’s now the most-followed on Twitter. John McCain, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to have a Twitter account, but he is winning the YouTube wars. Contribute ›Science Buzz Boeing has test fired an airborne laser gun that can fire with pinpoint accuracy. Welcome to the future, where chemical lasers will take out entire convoys in 26 seconds. Scary stuff: “The laser is silent and invisible, and can strike at long range in darkness.”Culture Buzz Japanese dome houses look like igloos and are made from a styrofoam that is “highly resistant” to earthquakes, fires, and typhoons. I picture a whole family of Bjorks crawling out of one of these. Contribute ›Whoa, look at Crazy Tim! He’s takin’ a bath in the sink! Now he’s getting us all fired from Burger King! Contribute ›Music Buzz Signed to Bad Boy Records by some guy named Diddy, the Atlanta native’s spacey style, “afro-punk” sound, and rabid attitude are catching the ears of many just in time for her EP to drop. Part Lena Horne, part Grace Jones, and all-around weirdo, Monae has made quite an impression on both music industry insiders and audiences hungry for R\u0026B with a salty twist.LOL Bush is the new LOL Cats. Contribute ›I cannot stop watching this dude’s videos in which he poorly attempts to sing TV show theme songs, adding an errie, bizarre, or downright tragic motif. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz “Bonus Jonas my ASS” is the fake diary of forgotten Frankie Jonas. As with Fake Steve Jobs, you don’t need to know much about the real Jonas Brothers to get a kick out of this. Select quotes: “My brother Joe’s always busy practicing taking off his purity ring as fast as possible” and “I like Metallica, Crocs, gettin’ paid, gettin’ laid and getting spayed (kittens only!). JK except for the kittens part!” Contribute ›Sports Buzz 24-year-old Janos Baranyai won’t be going home with any medals from the Olympics. This just looks so incredibly painful! The strangest part of the video, though, is just after Baranyai collapses on the mat in leg-shaking pain and a group of helpful Chinese assistants rush out to block him from view. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Some in-depth instructional kissing videos for you to watch and learn. I suppose they’re safe for work, but you might get some strange looks from some officemates. Contribute ›Two Bigfoot hunters say they the have the body of a dead Bigfoot. They are planning on releasing DNA evidence in a news conference on Friday. Contribute ›What does the U.S. have in common with Liberia and Burma? Contribute ›TV Buzz A show on the little-watched network Fuse.tv claims to be the female version of Jackass. I had no idea that Fuse showed programming besides long blocks of emo videos. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Photos of disassembled appliances are oddly captivating. Ever long to see the innards of your iron, waffle-maker or dustbuster? You’re in luck. This is somehow way better than seeing aniPhone’s guts. Contribute ›Animals talking to their owners. Contribute ›Focus on the Family reporter Stuart Shepard asked viewers to pray for “rain of Biblical proportions” during the Democratic National Convention. All cute-like too, like “Nice convention ya got here. Be a shame if God flooded it out.” Contribute ›Style Buzz Wide black leather cuffs have been spotted on various runways for fall. Along with leather fingerless gloves, it’s just one of a few fall 2008 fashion trends you can get at a sex fetish shop. Contribute ›Sports Buzz With 11 gold medals and counting, that seems to be the word on the street. All over the web and TV, people are touting Michael as the best Olympic athlete ever. With more golds then anyone in history, that seems to be a fair argument (apologies to Lewis, Spitz, and Owens), but now people are saying that he may be the greatest athlete of all time. That one requires a little more debate (and this is from someone who grew up in Baltimore). Jordan, Woods, Brown, Ali, Owens… Go Michael… make it 8 for 8, all in WR fashion! Contribute ›Sure, she fell off the balance beam and the U.S. only won a silver. She’s still got her looks! Contribute ›Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
