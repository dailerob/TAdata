One special feature is that it includes over 100 nerd holidays, like Jean Luc Picard\u0027s birthday. Which is way more useful than a bunch of photos of naked big-breasted women wielding katanas around.View the 7 Best LinksMusic Buzz Songs used in Guitar Hero III are enjoying a sales bump. Are there any Rush songs in Guitar Hero? We\u0027d love for those guys to be making money off this game, too.View the 4 Best LinksScience Buzz The fossilized claw of an 8-foot sea scorpion has been found in Germany. We can\u0027t help imagining how awesome it would be if you could get these at seafood restaurants. 18-inch claw? Yum!View the 4 Best LinksTech Buzz An interactive robot that sings, tells stories, and is a lot cuter than the Pleo. He just wants to hold you!

Edward Burns is like the Radiohead of film! On a side note, we hope women enjoy watching movies on their iPods because this movie looks like a total chick flick.View the 9 Best LinksTV Buzz People filming their own reactions to recent shocking viral videos - 2 Girls 1 Cup and BME Pain Olympics - are more fascinating than the videos themselves. We haven\u0027t seen any of the source videos in question, but judging from these reactions, we really don\u0027t want to, and the various underlying soundtracks you can hear in the background (piano, death metal) are therefore even more disturbing. This is like the adult version of those kids in pain videos.View the 10 Best LinksFood Buzz Heather Mills McCartney, an adamant vegan, urges you to drink milk from rats and dogs to help save the planet.

Which is to say, we\u0027ll probably keep on using it, but it won\u0027t be as crucial a method of communication. Except for spammers, of course.View the 9 Best LinksCulture Buzz The Archbishop of an Atlanta megachurch is at the center of another sex scandal. A paternity test revealed that Paulk\u0027s nephew is actually his son, meaning he slept with his brother\u0027s wife. Creepy, right? Paulk\u0027s been accused of worse.View the 5 Best LinksMusic Buzz Florida rapper/singer writes a song called \"Smell Yo\u0027 Dick,\" a foolproof tactic for figuring out whether your man is cheating on you. The nose knows! From personal experience, we can tell you that this is a much better way of sniffing out infidelity than litmus strips or private investigators.View the 12 Best LinksTV Buzz Find Thanksgiving TV specials and all your favorite shows on LocateTV.

Nu rave may be officially dead (seriously, no more neon, please) but we wonder if there\u0027s still hope for Lovefoxxx to rise up from its ashes. Dare we say: her cuteness rivals that of Bjork\u0027s.View the 8 Best LinksCulture Buzz There\u0027s a new documentary called The Blonde Mystique that explores the psychological phenomenon of blondness. We didn\u0027t think anyone actually still took this stereotype seriously, at least not since Three\u0027s Company was still on the air. As it turns out, according to this study, it\u0027s not that blondes are actually dumber, it\u0027s that men act dumber around them.View the 11 Best LinksPolitics Buzz In the political vocabulary of the 2008 election, Hillary Clinton keeps getting cast as Snow White, and her Democratic rivals as the seven dwarfs. So Barack Obama must be Happy, and John Edwards would be Grumpy—and Dennis Kucinich has to be Dopey.View the 8 Best LinksScience Buzz Personal genome analysis is now available commercially around $1000. Hmm, we\u0027re still trying to decide if we\u0027d rather buy that new flat-screen tv, or possess the knowledge that we\u0027re probably going to die of heart disease at the age of 67. It\u0027s a toss-up.View the 11 Best LinksTech Buzz Amazon releases its own ebook reader.
