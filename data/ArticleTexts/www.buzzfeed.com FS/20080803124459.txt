{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"An exhibit at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles recreates live dinosaurs, and it looks absolutely terrifying/awesome/terrifying.If Mariah Carey’s sexy jam was meant to be sung into a webcam by anyone, it was definitely this extremely young, completely unsupervised little kid.Culture Buzz “There are 8,000 nerve endings in the clitoris and this son of a bitch couldn’t find one of them.” Did your ears perk up? The publicists behind J.J. Salem’s Tan Lines sure hope so. They even put together a video of a bunch of randoms reading the line out loud, because nothing is funnier than realizing that most people are barely literate.Tech Buzz David Rees clip-art comic strip now has an animated version. Brought to you by 236.com, it mines the same deadpan absurdity for yuks about terrorism.TV Buzz Somewhere in the Navy Yards of Brooklyn sits the scrappy remaining set pieces after 25 years of Saturday Night Live. And somehow, Ellen Cleghorne was nowhere to be found.The super collider facility in Switzerland is about to go on-line.Everything you thought you knew about the New Jersey shore was completely true. It’s like a little United Nations filled with thick necks, popped collars, unsightly sunburn, and stupid, stupid people from Bayonne to Bergen County (and beyond!).Tech Buzz As the “chief lizard wrangler” of Mozilla (no, seriously), the trained lawyer is also a trapeze artist and sports a haircut that closely resembles her company’s logo (although Mitchell claims there’s no connection). She may have figured out how to build a great browser, but can’t someone get the lady a pair of scissors?Culture Buzz Street Artist Andy Uprock creates amazing mosaics by sticking plastic cups in chain-link fences. Uprock was inspired by the way kids stick their soda bottles through fences while they play. The Australian artist typically uses 2,500 cups to make his installations in such diverse places as Barcelona, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and most recently Greenpoint, Brooklyn.There’s a new photo of this creepy thing from Newsday, plus a video.Business Buzz For those of us fellas who find ourselves more damp than others in these sweltering summer months, there’s finally a solution that won’t toast your pits: a suit that emits deodorant! Until society finds it appropriate for a grown adult to live in meat locker (I totally would), it seems Japan has come up with the next best option.TV Buzz The era of LonelyGirl officially comes to an end today. We know you probably haven’t been watching in a while (or possibly ever), but LG15’s ending symbolizes the end of an geological period of Internet Time.She weighs 33 stones and eats 13,000 calories a day.Science Buzz A site making fun of (we guess?) people who refuse to spay or neuter their pets presents a gross alternative. If you can’t bring yourself to get Spot “fixed,” dog condoms are your only responsible option. Also, they are a totally disgusting idea.Celebrity Buzz 28-year-old Sean Avery is now dating Calvin Klein’s 51-year-old ex-wife, Kelly. Sean Avery seems to do everything for attention, whether it’s interning for fashion magazines or dating a “cougar.” He’s kind of like the new Dennis Rodman, but gayer.Culture Buzz With blinged-out pacifiers and names like “Pookie: The green-eyed baller,” Gangsta Babies combine Bratz with Cabbage Patch Kids and then go one step further. You have to be intrigued by a product with the tagline “Comin straight outta crib-town!” $112 gets you a set of four, inlcuding Pookie and his homies Benjino, Rey Rey and Deuce.Celebrity Buzz LifeStyles Condoms has offered Miley Cyrus 1 million dollars and a lifetime supply of condoms to be their spokesperson. Unfortunately for LifeStyles, Miley has promised to save herself until marriage. Still, there may be hope because we all know how that turns out.Photos from Aug. 1st solar eclipse.TV Buzz Listen to these recordings of Larry King drunk on old episodes of his radio show. Gawker has the recordings, Huffington Post has the transcripts. This makes me relate to and feel closer to Larry King than I ever have before.Celebrity Buzz With a pop career and a topless scandal to her name, she’s like the Australian Miley Cyrus (or Vanessa Hudgens). Jess is one half of the Aussie pop duo the Veronicas, though it’s impossible to be sure whether the topless shot at the center of the drama, which first appeared a few days ago on Fleshbot, is actually her because she has a twin sister (trust us, she’s a big deal Down Under). Still, it’s nice to see our foreign neighbors taking a page from the nudity scandal-as-career-move book.Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
