As usual the critics are dead wrong. Rudakova took Transporter 3 to soaring new Transporter heights with her “can you believe the movie director found her on the street!?!!”-style acting skillz, thick accent, terrible recurring dialogue about food she craves, and what felt like an 80-minute seduction scene.7 Responses · Add Yours ›You can\u0027t always blame global warming.Contribute ›Sports Buzz Too lazy to walk and too environmentally-conscious to drive, terrorists are turning to bikes to carry out their attacks.

Speaking of success, Gladwell\u0027s massive book sales appear to follow a simple formula: Step 1: Tell stories about special people with magic powers. Step 2: Explain how the magic powers can make you rich or popular or smart with almost no effort. I like to call it the “superheros and free lunch” strategy - since his books are about remarkable people who get amazing results with almost no effort. We simply can\u0027t resist fantasies about superheros and free lunches! Gladwell\u0027s two massive bestsellers both promise that we can get something for nothing: The Tipping Point explains “How Little Things Can Make A Big Difference” and Blink shows us “The Power of Thinking Without Thinking”. Outliers is a big shift away from the superhero and free lunch formula. It is the most sociological of Gladwell\u0027s books - suggesting that society shapes people, that success is often accidental, and circumstances matter more than individual talent. That might be why the book is getting panned by critics. The New York Times review calls the book “Glib, Poorly Reasoned and Thoroughly Unconvincing”. The Gladwell backlash is in full swing, perhaps because people only like Gladwell when he is telling them about superheroes and get free lunches!2 Responses · Add Yours ›Are you good at spotting buzz?
