The first test will begin at about 3:30 a.m. ET — but stop worrying, the world’s not going to end! Unless we get by an asteroid at the same time. Contribute ›Tech Buzz A full-page sized e-book reader that is being touted as the Kindle killer because the 8.5x11 inch real estate allows for a pop-up keyboard. It won’t fit in your pocket, but it’s geared more towards the briefcase-toting businessmen rather than the paperback-classics-teen-vogue reading types (like me!). Contribute ›Look at all these tiny toys from the Littlest Pet Shop collection. They’re SO TINY! Contribute ›Um, this blow-up children’s slide is a giant, uncircumcised penis. Contribute ›Steve Jobs isn’t dead. He swears. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Six fatal martial arts styles that will teach you how to end your opponent. Don’t try this at home.

Contribute ›Food Buzz Colonel Sanders’ secret handwritten recipe for fried chicken was relocated to a temporary location today. Security details included a locked box being handcuffed to a security guard who boarded an armored car under police escort. Apparently, it’s so important that only two executives have access to it, making this paper one of the most closely guarded corporate secrets. Contribute ›A county-by-county breakdown of what people call carbonated beverages. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Spore fans are not happy with the game’s anti-piracy DRM, so they’ve taken their protest to Amazon.

Contribute ›Tech Buzz A site that maps the popularity and density of your last name. Enter your last name and you’ll get back a map and stats about where your last name is most prevalent.

Contribute ›Culture Buzz Howard Stern is auctioning off the virginity of 22-year-old San Diego student Natalie Dylan to help her finance her college educaion.

Contribute ›Movie Buzz Perhaps taking a lesson from Radiohead and NIN, Michael Moore is releasing his next movie online for free on September 23rd. Part rally for the youth vote, part thank you to his fans, Slacker Uprising follows Moore on his 60 city tour to the 20 battleground states during the 2004 Presidential election.
