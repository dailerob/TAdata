Hamza Al-Khatib, a 13-year-old boy, was detained by Syrian forces at a checkpoint in the village of Jiza on April 29th. His barely recognizable corpse was returned to his parents nearly a month later. This video, filmed and posted on Youtube by his parents, details the horrific wounds covering Hamza\u0027s body. He was beaten, burned, shot and had his genitals cut off. Hamza has since become a martyr for the Syrian rebellion. WARNING: Graphic video.
