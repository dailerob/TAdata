{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tech Buzz New cameras from Casio come will a “make up feature” which uses in-camera technology to “beautify” the image. A natural next step after the Slimming Camera trend these cameras are able to recognize facial features and make skin look smoother, cover wrinkles and hide shadows, but you will still have to apply your lipstick and mascara yourself. Or you could just start taking pictures of better looking people. Contribute ›Style Buzz British claymation duo Wallace and Gromit are the new spokesmodels for the department store Harvey Nichols. They’ll wear tiny clay versions of designs by Armani, Alexander McQueen, and Dolce \u0026 Gabbana. Fashion has never been so…adorable. Contribute ›Culture Buzz A solid gold statue of Kate Moss has been unveiled in the British Museum. The work titled “Siren” was created by artist Marc Quinn and is said to be the largest gold statue erected since the times of Ancient Egypt. Start saving up, the statue will be auctioned off for charity some time in 2009. Contribute ›Politics Buzz As every American with access to 30 Rock and a blog has pointed out today, there is a slight visual similarity between comedy heart throb Tina Fey and Republican Vice Presidential hopeful Sarah Palin. This is the last post today about Palin, I swear. Contribute ›Where will we be in fifty years? Probably hanging out on “Biggest Island Available” living in igloo condos. Contribute ›Movie Buzz A round-up of pornos inspired by Stanley Kubrick films, including A Clockwork Orgy. You’ll definitely want to watch the clip from a spoof entitled The Sexxxing, which is slightly NSFW, about an office haunted by horny lesbians. Hopefully there are some giant genitalia topiaries featured in the full-length. Contribute ›A show called Time Warp on the Discovery Channel slows down a video of a dog drinking, and finds that dogs drink via a “reverse slurp.” Contribute ›Politics Buzz Sarah Palin is mother to five oddly named kids. Since it’s Palin Day, here’s what we could find on the rest of her family. Contribute ›Culture Buzz In this blog, the writer expresses his utter hatred towards the friendly, four legged animal. This is just one other reason why blogs are so great. Imagine if this guy was forced to keep all this pent up horse hatred inside. He might explode one day, and someone could get hurt. Contribute ›Someone’s gone and compiled a bunch of examples of “dick moves.” Contribute ›Culture Buzz The Harrold, TX, school board has decided to let some teachers bring guns to a tiny school with less than 100 students. You know, to protect the children. Contribute ›TV Buzz The prequel series to Werner Herzog’s documentary, Grizzly Man, premieres tonight on Animal Planet. The New York Times reviewed the show, and said it looks like “a chronicle of one man’s extended suicide”. Timothy Treadwell, the deceased star of Grizzly Man, is obviously the star of the show, as the 8 part documentary takes viewers through the hours of unused footage of Treadwell playing with bears, calling them names, and being generally crazy. Kids, don’t play with bears. Contribute ›Here’s a photo of Sarah Palin as the second place winner of the Miss Alaska pageant in 1984. Contribute ›Politics Buzz Now that it’s been announced that Sarah Palin is McCain’s choice for VP, information is surfacing about her husband, Todd Palin. The story of his life is like a cross between Mr. Mom and Cool Runnings. Contribute ›Culture Buzz First black presidential candidate! First Republican female VP candidate! OMG Michael Phelps 8 golds! We’re growing weary of all the era-defining moments of the last few weeks. Seriously, can’t we just go back to a regular, slow-news August? We’re world-historically tired. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz David Duchovny checked himself into a rehab center for sex addiction. So many “Californication” jokes to choose from, I think my head may explode… Contribute ›Culture Buzz A group of burly tattooed men met on the local hot rod scene, and somehow formed ‘Rescue Ink’, a group to help lost and abused animals. The images in the slideshow are like the most scary yet beautiful societal contrast ever, only instead of rainbows over an oil spill, these images manage to induce snuggle cravings in any hardened office worker. Contribute ›Shawn Johnson has some crazy abs for a 16 year old. Contribute ›A Palm Springs mother says her four-year-old son looks like Barack Obama. Contribute ›Politics Buzz McCain picked Sarah Palin, Governor of Alaska, as his running mate. A bold move! McCain can now safely count on those three electoral votes from Alaska. Palin’s a reformer who plays well to the cameras, but a state probe into her official conduct — she may have used her clout to fire her ex -brother-in-law from a state trooper’s position — could really backfire.
