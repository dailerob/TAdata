One lady says, and I quote, “To Stockton, Michael Jackson meant more to us than maybe Jesus did. I think they\u0027re even. They\u0027re both icons.”Tech Buzz Kill some dudes. This game starts off as a simple test of your grenade-aiming abilities, but gets more puzzley and interesting as it progresses and adds new elements to the gameplay.Miller unveils a new product to help keep our urge to look like a douchebag in check.In this hilarious Dutch commercial, the perils of a hard-to-open cream can for your morning coffee are brutally exposed.

I\u0027ve been at music festivals all weekend and nothing nearly this exciting happened. Although getting to see Slipknot play came pretty close.Culture Buzz This is like the Forbes power list, but exclusively for little people. If they really want to get rid of the “M-word” they need help from some of these people.You know how it\u0027s hard to keep up on your twitter account because you have to switch out of World of Warcraft to see it? And how it\u0027s super hard to talk to girls? If so, TweetCraft can solve one of your problems.The sports aficionados at Deadspin drew this basketball thing, so that we could all understand what Sarah Palin was talking about on Friday. I wish every Bill Simmons article came with one of these.Celebrity Buzz Tom Green is reportedly in serious condition after a weird incident involving a collision in Fullerton, California. Apparently, after the actor hit a pickup truck with his Mercedes, the driver and two other men got out of the truck and beat him senseless. [UPDATE: Surprise! OK, not really a surprise, but this was all a 4Chan hoax. Tom Green is alive! The long, fruitful history of Tom Green and 4Chan makes for some pretty interesting reading. Site NSFW.]Just a PSA! Jordan Catalano lives, faith restored, God Bless America etc.Here are some heavily-accented puppets reflecting on the legacy of Michael Jackson\u0027s “Earth Song.” I was wrong, this one totally tops the Free Willy song.TV Buzz Little People are asking the FCC to ban the word Midget on television after Joan Rivers suggested hanging midgets for a commercial on an episode of Celebrity Apprentice in April. Little People are claiming that the term “midget” is as offensive and inappropriate as an racial or ethnic slur, and should not be allowed on television. I think the easier solution would just be to ban Celebrity Apprentice from television.This is a 4th of July salute/Michael Jackson hate speech that Congressman Pete King posted on YouTube. In the video he calls Michael a low-life, a pedophile, and a pervert. He should\u0027ve said something like: “Why does the media spend so much time on celebrity instead of our soldiers in Iraq.” But instead turns it into a total MJ hate speech. And really, how can you hate Michael Jackson?!If you slip a Haribo Twin Cherries over your index finger it totally looks like a donger.

Seriously, see for yourself.Culture Buzz Here is a British spy and future head of MI6 (I guess that makes him “M”) whose wife decided to publish beach photos and home addresses on her Facebook page.

But it\u0027s nice to see that the Bond films are truthful with regard to swim attire.Not even nine months old, Jenny the Pug puppy is already feeling those maternal urges as she pushes her stuffed animals (yes, two Pug dolls!) around Portland, Oregon.
