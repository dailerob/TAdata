And just like in my office NCAA pool, I’ll probably favor the contestants with the cutest outfits.Contribute ›Culture Buzz In Japan, an adult diaper fashion show is held to de-stigmatize the use of diapers for the elderly. It’s nice when your country’s economy isn’t totally falling apart and you can concentrate on the really important issues, like making old people feel less self-conscious about wearing diapers.Contribute ›“The ugly redheaded stepchildren of the animal kingdom don’t get much attention compared to the perennial endangered animal favorites like pandas, polar bears, and owls.” With good reason.Contribute ›Politics Buzz The woman competing against Joe Biden for his Senate seat is a Sarah Palin lookalike.

This past weekend he won the PGA Tour Championship, his first major tournament win. A few years back people were wondering if Camilo could be the next Tiger Woods (He’s already been called a sexy version of him.) The 26-year-old Colombian has now won two tournaments in a row raising that same question once again.Contribute ›http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf...Sure, the economical foundation of our nation is eroding, but at least our Creme Eggs are safe.
