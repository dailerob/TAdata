And, of course, that Hillary Clinton is a lesbian? These and many other crazy rumors about the candidates are swirling on the Internet. And they must be true, because they\u0027re on the Internet. (Well, some of them are true, actually.)View the 13 Best LinksMovie Buzz Not only do Tom Cruise\u0027s Lions for Lambs co-stars Robert Redford and Meryl Streep dislike him, but the film tanked at the box office and looks like one of the biggest duds of Cruise\u0027s career. Maybe the weird schoolboy haircut has cooled moviegoers to Cruise? Nah, we think people just aren\u0027t interested in the film\u0027s brainless sermonizing. Just wait till audiences get a load of him as a Nazi!View the 9 Best LinksBusiness Buzz Farms make the best vacations.

Number 597 on Rural Route 9A just doesn\u0027t have the same ring as telling someone you\u0027re located at 7 Park Avenue, does it?View the 4 Best LinksBusiness Buzz A new mutual fund which aims to get hip young clients to start investing.
