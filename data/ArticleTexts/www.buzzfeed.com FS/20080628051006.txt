Here it is visiting Wal-Mart.Business Buzz She placed an ad on Craigslist listing her home for $344k, but has added her companionship with a $500k add-on fee. I wouldn’t pay more than ten dolla for that ho! Just kidding, but it seems like this woman has a seriously inflated sense of ego to charge $500k for her self-worth.The detention letter sent to a student punished for his “blatant disregard” for the authority of his stupid teacher.Tech Buzz A mindless, fun Flash game perfect for wasting your last Friday hours. I’m not sure why you launch the hedgehog into the sky, but you do. The hedgehog just wants to make it into space.Movie Buzz Despite a seeming inability to release a film that does poorly at the box office, Will Smith may have a real stinker on his hands with Hancock. I love the premise of this film (resentful superhero!) and am not immune to the charms of Will Smith, but if the reviews are to be believed, mistakes were made in its making. I’m also sad that the trailer does, in fact, contain a spoiler (though I won’t say what).Culture Buzz Listen to this voicemail of a psychotic and very aggressive guy trying to pick up a girl. So this is why everyone feels so sorry for single women.Politics Buzz Said McCain, chuckling, “And I stopped beating my wife just a couple of weeks ago.” Click here for the context. Oh man. Is that why Cindy McCain is on crutches?The image you see when Twitter is down (which is often), has a fan club.Celebrity Buzz Arpad Busson is Uma Thurman’s Swiss fiancé and the father of two of supermodel Elle Macpherson’s children. The socialite financier in hedge funds dated Macpherson for seven years but the couple never married because (according to Macpherson) Busson is a devout Catholic and refused to marry a divorcee because even though they had two children out of wedlock. Macpherson will probably not be two happy when she finds out about Busson’s engagement to Thurman, a two-time divorcee.Tech Buzz Jakob Lodwick, Vimeo founder and self-proclaimed Fameball, has said good-bye to Tumblr and “the Social Web.” Will it last? It’s the latest in a long line of “final posts” — Dave Winer, Julia Allison come to mind — that really mean “I’m really upset and I’m taking a break”. We don’t think it will stick, but goodbyes are always fun to read, even if they’re fake. Send us your fake goodbye post and we’ll add it to the list.Calvin Morett, 19, dressed in a penis constume, disrupts the Saratoga Springs High School’s 135th commencement ceremony at SPAC Thursday, June 26.Style Buzz So much for nuns and Mexican ladies having all the fun! One jewelry designer is making the Catholic prayer beads available to all the nice Jewish girls and boys. Who would’ve thought a simple accessory might finally bring an end to the war that brews in Williamsburg?Watch for the M. Night Shyamalan style surprise ending (hint: it involves FAILURE).“Double Fault” is a goofy video homage to Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors.Celebrity Buzz The woman in the Vern Troyer sex tape has been identified as an aspiring model. Shrider, 22, is from Tampa (or possibly Kentucky) and reportedly once hoped to marry Troyer. Will we find out who leaked the tape?Tech Buzz As proud soccer mom Jeannie Tate, former SNL scribe Liz Cackowski hosts a talk show from inside her own minivan as she weaves her way through suburban side streets with kids (and the occasional comedy star) in tow. If we knew that all one needs to rope Rashida Jones into hanging out is an Aerostar and a bad bob cut, we’d have already been in Danbury by now.Culture Buzz What’s up with all the babies making babies? While some blame President Bush’s insistent promotion of abstinence (or its medical term “Genitalia Imaginaris”), others think that old sleeper hit Juno is to blame. Between Jamie Lynn Spears, the Gloucester girls, and The Baby Borrowers, don’t be surprised if our next President gives an official government job to [my favorite] creepy baby photog Anne Geddes.Two friends who bought a lion cub at a department store in the 60s are finally reunited with him after he’s been released to the wild.Cuban drummer named Tico Torres has a tiny vagina-shaped goatee.Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
