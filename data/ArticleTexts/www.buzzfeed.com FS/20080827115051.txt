Contribute ›A simple explanation of the key difference between the two. Contribute ›Tropical storm Gustav is expected to be a Major Category 3 hurricane possibly headed for New Orleans sometime this weekend. Contribute ›Culture Buzz A blog that “provides a forum for stories about all those amazing sexual encounters you almost had but didn’t.” Because we learn from our failures. It’s like the NY Mag Sex Diaries combined with the FAIL blog. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Good Magazine maps out historical routes from Christopher Columbus to Amelia Earhart. This would have come in so handy in middle school, when we stupidly relied on Janet Jackson for our geography lessons. Contribute ›Chris Matthews takes on Clintons for Mccain founder Cristi Adkins at the Democratic National Convention. Contribute ›The 45-second trailer for Seth MacFarlane’s Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy is now live on YouTube!

Contribute ›TV Buzz Buffy’s back! …Well, kind of, as TheWB.com launches today, where you can watch old shows from before The CW begat Gossip Girl and America’s Next Top Model.

Contribute ›Tech Buzz A command line for the internet. It’s only available for Firefox and only tech geeks will love it, but Ubiquity looks like a handy tool for doing things on the web. Contribute ›Style Buzz Dark lipstick is the main makeup trend for fall. Who wore it best, Mary-Kate Olsen or Marilyn Manson? My vote would have to go to Marilyn Manson.
