Who\u0027s got the best counting system? The New York Times and the Associated Press can\u0027t agree, though as of today both put Obama slightly in the lead.View the 4 Best LinksTech Buzz CNN\u0027s new user-generated news site.

We suppose it takes pulling a Paris Hilton to get noticed.View the 9 Best LinksTech Buzz Tips and tricks from Nick Denton and his minions about how to write the perfect Gawker item.

This list of top 10 songs that exemplify auto-tune abuse has been circulating on the web. Do you believe in life after love?

Not all acne is created equal, we guess.View the 6 Best LinksStyle Buzz Lip gloss that claims to increase energy and reduce cravings.
