It’s like pinball…in the future!!Celebrity Buzz “Hot 100” lists vary tremendously depending on whose voting: man, woman, gay, straight. Compare and judge the “Hot 100” lists for yourself.Movie Buzz A rom-com/slasher film, set in the woods, is the world’s first mumblecore horror movie. This looks suitably endearing to be unsettling, in the sense that a person with a paper bag over their head is both scary and laughable.Contestant in the 2008 National Spelling Bee mistakes “numnah” for “numbnut.”Style Buzz Peacock motifs are showing up everywhere from clothing, jewelry and handbags to housewares. Despite the bird’s sometimes violent tendencies, the allure of peacock feathers cannot be denied. My favorite is this Peacock Costume, which might just become my summer uniform.Cutting down Andy Rooney’s 60 Minutes monologues — keeping only his first and last sentences — changes them from windy rants to haiku-like gems.Culture Buzz Preparation H shrinks hemorrhoids, but recently, a few macho men headed out for the clubs have decided that smearing the cream on their torsos will result in a shrinkage of their skin and vessels—thus making them looked “ripped.” Better known as “Irish chapstick,” this stuff works wonders as undereye cream and as a pectoral enhancer.

If you were figuring out where to drop your stimulus check, now you know: on a cartoon superhero meerkat.NASA’s Mars rover Spirit (from 2005) sent back a nice sunset picture from the Red Planet.Politics Buzz Bill Clinton calls Todd Purdum, the national editor for Vanity Fair, a scumbag over an article he wrote implying Bill had been promiscuous since his 2004 bypass surgery. If someone spread a rumor that you were somehow linked to Gina Gershon, I’m sure you’d be absolutely outraged as well.A drunk driver crashed into a bike race in Mexico, killing one person.TV Buzz The original Buster Bluth of the much-beloved Arrested Development has landed recurring roles in Samantha Who and Chuck. With an Arrested Development movie in the works, we can’t be too upset that the brilliantly funny actor will be reduced to presumably less-than-worthy material. Instead, we’ll just begin counting down the days until Buster’s awkwardly-rejected massages grace the silver screen.Business Buzz Kinko’s renamed “FedEx Office”. FedEx bought Kinko’s back in 2004 for $2.4 billion — a whopping $2 million per store. The deal did not work out that well so they are re-naming the stores. Instead of a copy center, they are now touting the stores as a “back office” for small businesses. This is the hottest buzz of the year. ;)Tech Buzz The next iPhone comes out in a week; here is what the current rumor landscape look like. It will be thinner (or thicker); it will support video (or have a 3 mega-pixel camera); it will have GPS (or Bluetooth stereo). Start measuring your own expectations now!Tech Buzz A blog that chronicles the history of amateur bands formed in the “suburban garages, high school music rooms, and college dorms” of America. So your dreams of being the next Steven Tyler didn’t turn out as you’d originally hoped. At least now you can find a whole new adoring public! (And even if they’re laughing at you, attention is attention, right?)Culture Buzz A portable, laptop-sized grill only costs $48 and makes a perfect father’s day present. It’s like the MacBook Air of the mobile meat set. Great for camping, picnics, and terraces.It’s amazing how, with the assistance of Photoshop, famous pretty ladies can so quickly go from glamour to goblin.Style Buzz Six fashion designers uncover the latest couture car covers made exclusively for Intersection Magazine. These are just prototypes developed for some fancy magazine photo shoot, but it seems like something that should exist. Your neighbors will never know that a Corolla is sitting under that Louis Vuitton cover in your driveway.Culture Buzz Hundreds of millions of YouTube views go to “fake porn” videos that actually don’t show anything sexy at all. Clever YouTube users have figured out how to get huge traffic for the videos they upload. Just post a political rant, give it a hardcore sex title, add a provocative thumbnail image, and millions of people will click to your video! The trick is to include the sex image at exactly the place in the video where YouTube auto-grabs the thumbnail image. One video has over 67+ million views but is mysteriously absent from YouTube’s list of most viewed videos. I guess they don’t want us to know that 87% of all YouTube traffic is from people searching in vain for porn.Tech Buzz Google as a unix shell. Surf the true geek way; just type h to get a list of commands, and you’re off!
