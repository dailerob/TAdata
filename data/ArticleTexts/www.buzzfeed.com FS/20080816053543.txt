{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"A pie chart by the blog Hipster Runoff describes the people you meet at a show. Contribute ›Food Buzz The most delicious and amazing thing ever made. Take an milkshake. Add beer. Enter heaven. They serve these at a burger place near my apartment, and now I’ve developed a problem. Contribute ›Photos surface of Obama body-surfing in Hawaii, showing off a buff bod. Contribute ›The thumbnail doesn’t do this image justice — the Burj is already the tallest skyscraper in the world even though it’s not done, and it certainly looks like it. Contribute ›On Fox \u0026 Friends, 91-year-old Ernest Borgnine says the secret to staying young at his old age is masturbation. Contribute ›Sports Buzz What’s Phelps listening to? You’ve seen him standing poolside with the white earbuds in, and you’ve surely thought, “Hm, I wonder what he’s listening to.” Hit the link below for a rare glimpse. Contribute ›Slate has come up with an interactive timeline depicting Obama’s life as portrayed by four different sources. Contribute ›Culture Buzz A story on MSNBC tells of a salon in NYC that offers waxing discounts on children 8 years and younger with “virgin” hair. And you thought getting to eat at Shoney’s for free was pretty cool! Kids and senior citizens always get the best deals on everything. Contribute ›Science Buzz A unique perspective of a Space Shuttle liftoff. The guy with the camera sounds stoned, but you can pretty easily share the excitement. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Nathan Lane is releasing a product meant to “boost lip volume up to 40 percent,” which makes sense because — oh wait, no, that makes NO SENSE AT ALL. Weirder yet, Jodie Foster is expected to “provide funding.” Is it just me, or is the thought of Nathan Lane and Jodie Foster chatting about lip volume utterly ridiculous? Actually, isn’t the thought of Nathan Lane and Jodie Foster just talking ridiculous? Contribute ›Culture Buzz Famed erotic photographer Richard Kern gives you tips on how to take sexy yet arty photos. Make every photo look like an American Apparel ad with these handy tips. Oh, except for the advice of “Don’t be a f**king sleazebag,” which seems to work for some people. Contribute ›Am I the only one who finds these Olympics gymnastics photos kind of risque? Contribute ›Grainy shots of what might be the HTC Dream, or G1, the iPhone killer that’s a Google/Sidekick mash-up. Contribute ›Tech Buzz A digital camera designed for visually impaired people has a unique feature which records sound for three seconds after pressing the shutter button. The sound is used as a reference when reviewing and managing the photos. Umm, I re-read that paragraph twice and I still don’t get it. But it sounds cool nonetheless. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Make your manga avatar. It’s finally time — you held off on getting a Facebook page forever, but finally relented. Then you started using Twitter, or maybe started a Tumblr. Now it’s time to jump into the necessary evil of avatars, if for no other reason than to waste 15 minutes on a Friday. Contribute ›Tech Buzz A search engine for public toilets in Manhattan. Perfect for the urbanite on the go or, y’know, the hobo with a PDA (don’t think they don’t exist). Contribute ›TV Buzz The new season, which starts September 3rd, will feature a contestant who used to be male. She probably stands a better chance at winning than the Asian girl - the Asian girl always gets kicked out by the second episode. Contribute ›TV Buzz The A\u0026E reality show about interventions is fascinating, disgusting. Now well into it’s fifth season, the grim pile-up that is Intervention finally gives you a reason to watch A\u0026E when you get home after a late night. Contribute ›Culture Buzz Every couple of days, Flying Pizza Kitty goes on a new adventure in an animated .gif. So far Kitty has faced down a dinosaur, the Death Star, an underground robot and zombie fruit. Contribute ›A shopkeeper finds a Homer Simpson Euro Coin.
