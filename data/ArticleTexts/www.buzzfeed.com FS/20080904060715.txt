{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CNN posted a rather insinuating photo of Sarah Palin this morning. Contribute ›Science Buzz Here’s a video documenting a mating behavior called “penis fencing” engaged in by a certain species of hermaphroditic flatworm.

Contribute ›Politics Buzz Now that we’ve moved past the fact that Tina Fey looks like Sarah Palin, bloggers have taken the next natural step of casting the remaining characters in the fictional [albeit inevitable] biopic. Until someone is willing to help Joey Lawrence find the Fountain of Youth, good luck finding someone to do young papa and hearthtrob Levi Johnston’s hockey hair justice! Contribute ›TV Buzz The results are in, and it looks like 90210 was a hefty disappointment, as echoed throughout the blogosphere.
