{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tech Buzz A new Twitter site, Twitter is Penis (or what we’ve nicknamed TIP), has invaded Twitterland today. TIP hijacks innocent tweets, replaces certain words with “penis” - then republishes them. Our favorite so far: “Wow good thing we’re having cocktails tonight, work is really making my penis hurt today.” Feeling offended that your tweet turned to penis? Don’t. It’s just the TIP. Contribute ›College Humor brings a comedic twist to Shel Silverstein’s The Giving Tree in a new short called “The Really, Really Giving Tree.” Contribute ›Movie Buzz The new Bond girl will soon be a household name. Every Bond girl is hotter than the last. She also perfects that innocent milkmaid look in the BBC version of Tess of D’Urbervilles. Contribute ›TV Buzz The CW says it will reveal the answer to one of the greatest mysteries of our time in an episode on Tuesday. Now is the time to get your guess on record: Will it be Dylan, or Steve, or Brandon, or a random and as-yet unidentified character, maybe someone from Gossip Girl? Contribute ›Both amazing and kind of disgusting at the same time, this picture is probably the reason a lot of people are afraid of aging. Contribute ›David Foster Wallace’s death has provoked lots of online interest in suicide. I am collecting the most interesting graphics - you can help me out by posting graphs or charts below.

Sports include wheelchair fencing, sitting volleyball, and soccer for the blind or visually impaired. The games are not being televised, but you can watch them and highlights from the past 2 weeks online. Contribute ›Yet another 2008 election info-visualization site, this one dedicated to breaking down news mentions. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Mark Ronson, aka Heartthrob/DJ Extraordinaire, has broken up with his girlfriend, Daisy Lowe! Not that you have a chance with him, but one can dream. Contribute ›So we all pretty much know they’re dating, but a new picture confirms it. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz Meet Miley Cyrus’ new boyfriend. He’s 20. He sings country music. And he is an underwear model, so it’s like the future photo scandal is already built-in. Contribute ›Meet the Swiftboaters of 2008: the Hockey Moms Against Sarah Palin!

Contribute ›Business Buzz Three huge financial institutions were liquidated and resold over the weekend, and thousands of bank closures are to be expected in the coming months. Yikes. I hope this doesn’t make me feel guilty for watching The Hills tonight instead of CNBC. Contribute ›Politics Buzz Gov. Sarah Palin had a tanning bed installed inside the Alaskan Governor’s Mansion, which is nearly 100 years old. To be fair, it’s the only oven big enough to cook the caribou in. Contribute ›Celebrity Buzz City Rag names the new Hollywood look — “heavy concealer, unnaturally yellow hair, and a dull, wonky-eyed stare” — after old ladies who turn tricks. No offense meant to actual granny hookers! How long until this look makes its way to Urban Outfitters? Contribute ›Culture Buzz An online dating site for people with STD’s. As the majority of people are being infected with STD’s, we should just look at the positive side. Having the same STD as another person could be a real bonding point, like sharing a love for fried chicken, or indie music. Contribute ›Tech Buzz Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane has launched his new site, which focuses on Google-AdSense-distributed comedy shorts. Google finally has a sense of humor!

Contribute ›Business Buzz The U.S. and global markets are reacting to the triple news of Lehman’s bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch’s sale to Bank of America and AIG’s request of a $40 billion bailout from the government.
