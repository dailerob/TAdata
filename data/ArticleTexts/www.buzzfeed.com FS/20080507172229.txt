{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Sports Buzz As New York and other large cities prepare to construct (or at least mark off) more bike lanes, a debate is brewing about their efficacy. Lax enforcement and a slew of fatal accidents are leading many cyclists to the conclusion that bike lanes are merely a token effort on the part of urban planners and city officials.Movie Buzz With Speed Racer about to debut, the Wachowski-hatin’ starts anew. It’s been one long downward slide for the Wachowski brothers since the first Matrix, and the vultures are gathering, hoping for something to pick at after Speed Racer finally comes out. Their reclusiveness hasn’t helped matters much.Science Buzz A major volcanic eruption in Chile, a horrifying cyclone in Myanmar, a series of global earthquakes, most recently in Japan: Have the end times arrived? The Myanmar death toll keeps climbing, and the area around the Chaiten volcano has been evacuated. Relief organizations are doing their best to help out.Style Buzz The classic florals from Liberty of London have been everywhere. The cute florals show up in Chloe Sevigny’s line for Opening Ceremony, and just recently on some adorable Nike hightops. Due to the popularity of the “Liberty Print’ keyword, its now impossible to find an affordable early 90s floral frock on eBay.Style Buzz MIA is launching her own clothing line, which will include bomber jackets, leggings and T-shirts in bold bright hues and graphic prints. It’s kind of magical the way M.I.A. wears really loud, mismatched patterns without looking idiotacky. Now you, too, can attempt to pull off the same look.Culture Buzz Sad Kermit, who covers the saddest songs ever, has a new video where he re-enacts the attempted suicide scene from The Royal Tenenbaums. I always knew from watching the Muppet Babies that Kermit would grow up to be the emo one.Style Buzz An Illinois man has had a custom Pabst Blue Ribbon coffin made for himself. Despite his love of PBR, he’s in no immediate danger of dying, so is currently using the custom rig as a cooler. It’s like another, darker take on the multi-use idea behind those coffin couches.Movie Buzz Now playing at film festivals worldwide, writer/actress/producer/crazy lady Isabella Rossellini’s bizarre, entertaining series of short films for the Sundance Channel focuses on the sex life of insects. Thanks to Green Porno, you no longer have to feel guilty about imagining what you could do with eight legs and six eyes.Culture Buzz A site that posts photoshopped photos where the heads of dads with their kids are switched around. This is like Ann Geddes on crack! Be sure to cue up “You Think You’re a Man” by the Vaselines while perusing this site.Politics Buzz The most popular metereologist on the Weather Channel is at the center of a sexual harassment law suit. Apparently her co-anchor, Bob Stokes, made crude remarks like, “Will you lick my swizzle stick?” and insulted her during live shows when she didn’t respond to his advances. It’s tough being hot in the otherwise drab world of meteorology.Food Buzz Drink connoisseurs who want the ice option with the least surface area are turning to ice balls as the solution. From cheap plastic ice molds to pricey ice presses, there are a variety of ways to make your ice round (and here’s how to make it totally clear, if that’s important to you).Culture Buzz The world’s most intelligent goldfish can play soccer, basketball, and do the limbo! The next time you’re contemplating whether or not to go to the gym, think of Comet. If you’re less active than a goldfish, you might want to put down the Doritos and get on the treadmill.Culture Buzz A rash of factual errors and misspellings plague America’s angriest signage. It turns out blog comments do have a precursor: Protest signs, usually angry, often wrong. Though there is something far sadder about someone laboring over their angry sign with paint or markers and still spelling ‘john’ incorrectly.Business Buzz The maker of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles announced an offer that caps the price of gasoline at $2.99 a gallon for three years for people who buy or lease new vehicles from Wednesday through June 2. It doesn’t take a math expert to figure out that more fuel-efficient cars will save you more money in the long-run. However, a pair of blue plastic TruckNutz really only look good on a pick-up truck - so you’ve got a tough decision to make.Movie Buzz Tony Stark’s Girl Friday is getting love as a superhero assistant/sex symbol. Gwyneth Paltrow may have undone the badness of Sliding Doors and Shallow Hal with her turn in Iron Man.Sports Buzz The name of the horse that was euthanized at the Kentucky Derby after breaking two ankles while crossing the finish line in second place. Politicos are drawing parallels between Hillary Clinton’s tragic horse pick and the Presidential race.TV Buzz Lost amid the furor of last week’s photo scandal, Miley Cyrus is also in the middle of a heated dance off with the guys behind Step Up 2: The Streets. The three videos below tell the story better than we ever could, but the basic arc runs thus: John Chu, the director behind dance flick Step Up 2, challenged Miley Cyrus and her pal Mandy to a dance battle via his YouTube blog; Miley and Mandy responded with a video of their own; then Chu and dance maniac Adam Sevani made a response-to-the-response video, featuring cameos by Lindsay Lohan (?) and Adam Sandler (??). Now the three videos have 5.3 million views between them.Culture Buzz These photos of fat monkeys with saggy boobs were just too good to not share with the world. Plus, it’s a really slow day. Hot monkeys with D-cups are sure to satisfy all of your animal porn fantasies.Celebrity Buzz Ah, Young Hollywood. It’s stories like this that make us long for the days when troubled starlets were at least classy about their problems. You know the old story: some chick at a nightclub wore an $11,000 mink coat handed down to her from her grandmother, and before she knew it, it as gone! Then she saw pictures of Lindsay Lohan wearing the coat in a tabloid, thus realizing that she had to have stolen it because, in fact, she was sitting next to her in the club that very same evening. After contacting Lindsay’s lawyers, the coat was promptly returned to her apartment reeking of booze and cigarettes.TV Buzz And it all comes full circle as VH1 rounds up contestants fromFlavor Of Love, I Love New York, and Rock of Love to compete for $250,000. Between all the contestants, the amount of collagen, silicone and eyeliner might officially make the set of I Love Money a toxic wasteland (in every sense of the word).Get traffic, content, and influence by joining the BuzzFeed network.
