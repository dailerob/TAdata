(via The Uniblog) View Image ›It’s a long way to the weekend, so now seems as good a time as any for more funny, beautifully executed and just plain odd Fan-Art. Miss a past segment? View List ›Earlier today a bear-safety lecture at Yellowstone park being hosted in response to bear attacks from only two days ago was interrupted by yet another bear. Bears are relentless. That is why (along with it being the end of a long Monday) I feel this is the perfect opportunity to re-publish an article I wrote for my high-school paper many years ago entitled “How To Protect Yourself From A Bear Attack.” Stay safe and add any of your own tips!

View Image ›News of the World\u0027s death is still fresh but there are already autopsy photos. Someone at Gawker got these photos from a “an American media exec” who snuck into the offices to take them. Very eerie. Reminds me of the photos of The Wire\u0027s abandoned soundstages. But you know, real. (via gawker.com) View List ›This. Changes. EVERYTHING. View List ›Here are some awesome pictures of Flickr user Pauline Locke\u0027s grandfather working at the London Zoo in the 1930s. I think the little girl is his daughter. Can you imagine?! View List ›James Whittemore, a 22-year-old actor alternately described by media outlets as “jobless” and “failed,” got drunk on Saturday night and smashed his way into the Ed Sullivan Theater (after being caught urinating on the doors by surveillance cameras). He proceeded to cause $5,000 worth of damage to the lobby and box office. Hopefully he takes this act on the road and trashes Leno\u0027s theater.

What follows is the best the NBA has had to offer this past month. (via Ology.com) View List ›Set your clocks, Potter fans! If you can\u0027t be in the sweaty crowds at the Lincoln Center in NYC (*weep*), this is the next best thing for watching the Harry Potter stars walk the red carpet. View Media ›In his continued quest for dominance over his late night peers, Jimmy Fallon has booked beloved indie act Panda Bear for his first ever television appearance. With a long list of noteworthy acts, plus The Roots as as a backing band, (and that whole Odd Future thing) Fallon\u0027s Late Night may be the closest thing modern television has to the musical relevance that was once enjoyed by American Bandstand. View List ›This has to be the new thing. With the recently released Facemouth app for iOS devices, you can take a photo or video of your mouth and insert it onto a variety of celebrities\u0027 and cultural figures\u0027 faces. The possibilities are endless. And can be somewhat disturbing. (What more could you want?)

I\u0027m torn between emotions of intense shoe envy and relief in choosing a pair of flats over any of these torturous heels. View List ›Actually all of the age old questions. When Nick hooks up with Brian\u0027s girlfriend, the truth (all of it) comes out. Watch Video ›Wait a tick! They were secretly forcing us to learn! Through fun!
