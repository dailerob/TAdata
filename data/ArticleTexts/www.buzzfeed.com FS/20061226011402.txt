{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Lifestyle Buzz More adventures from the frontier of the War on Christmas. Trending the War on Christmas is so fun, it\u0027s like we\u0027re not even working. Thankfully, there are so many pro-active Jesus-haters doing blogworthy things these days. Merry Christmas! It was either this or the \"War on Fatties.\"View the 10 Best LinksPolitical Buzz The White House blacks out portions of a \"New York Times\" op-ed by former CIA official. The White House\u0027s favorite make-up trick! Hide those giant bags under your eyes with large amounts of black marker for that mysterious smoky look.View the 10 Best LinksTech Buzz The co-founders of Skype and Kazaa bring you this new peer-to-peer technology which could revolutionize the way you watch television. The Venice Project is generating buzz of Zune vs iPod proportions, being called the potential YouTube killer. The only snags are that it\u0027s not browser-based like YouTube, and so far, it only works on a PC. One redeeming factor is that it was developed by a respected Swede and not Microsoft. We\u0027ll see how far that takes it....View the 8 Best LinksTech Buzz A website that generates your peculiar aristocratic title. Now that we\u0027ve established why you won\u0027t be needing that New Year\u0027s Resolution generator, here\u0027s something equally useless. It\u0027s a meme! Don\u0027t expect anything life-altering.View the 6 Best LinksPolitical Buzz There are no winners and no losers in the game of life. Your life is going nowhere. You\u0027re stuck in that purgatory between success and failure. And that\u0027s totally fine, you\u0027ve learned to deal with it. But does everything in politics have to be a big fat reminder? Don\u0027t bother making a New Year\u0027s resolution, you don\u0027t have a future!View the 7 Best LinksMusic Buzz In honor of the 7th Harry Potter book title being revealed today, listen to some Harry-Potter-obsessed indie rock. Harry and the Potters are celebrating Christmas harder than any other novelty punk band around! Some of my favorite tracks include \"This Book Is So Awesome\" and \"Cho Chang, What Have I Done?\" God, they\u0027re so cute I could die.View the 8 Best LinksPolitical Buzz Congressman Virgil Goode issues letter declaring Muslims will take over America if stricter immigration policies aren\u0027t enforced. Apparently, Virgil Goode is way better at long-term trend-tracking than we are. He must have some super-sensitive racial-malady detector that only rednecks have.View the 10 Best LinksTech Buzz Damn yourself to hell via YouTube, win a free DVD! Wow, no one told me that my fellow comrades in the War on Christmas were HOT! We are totally gonna win this one.View the 7 Best LinksFood Buzz Red and green festive salads. Just because you can\u0027t cook doesn\u0027t mean you have to have a crappy Christmas. Eat a Christmas salad! It will be beautiful, and you won\u0027t feel fat afterwards.View the 6 Best LinksMovie Buzz Second trailer of this highly anticipated action movie released today. This trend isn\u0027t so much about the movie itself (which isn\u0027t due out until July 2007) but the trailer, which seeks to capture your nostalgic robot heart.View the 8 Best LinksLifestyle Buzz It\u0027s been a long, painful two weeks since the last cute-animal trend. These unlikely duos are cuddly and cute, unlike other unexpected couples we\u0027ve been hearing about this week (Christian Slater and Sharon Stone, Martha Stewart and Anthony Hopkins).View the 7 Best LinksScience Buzz Bloggers are commemorating Carl Sagan on the 10th anniversary of his death.

So start blogging! You owe your atheism to him.View the 8 Best LinksFashion Buzz Socially-conscious canvas slip-on shoes. Two noteworthy items about these simple and inoffensive shoes: 1) for every pair you buy, a pair gets donated to an Argentinean in need and 2) they were created by \"Amazing Race\" reality TV star Blake Mycoskie. Check out the hand-painted grafitti edition, a colorful alternative to polka-dot Nikes.View the 8 Best LinksMusic Buzz The latest Moog keyboard \"Little Phatty\" will ship out on February 2007, and are expected to sell out. Synth nerds are snorting with glee over these new all-analog keyboards that Bob Moog designed right before he died. At a whopping $1375, your eBay search for the quintessential vintage Moog may or may not be over. Atleast this one will weigh less than 30 lbs and there\u0027s a higher probability that all the keys will actually work.View the 9 Best LinksTech Buzz Condé Nast\u0027s new MySpace for teenage girls will launch in February 2007. Young girls will finally have an outlet where they can discuss their love for friendship bracelets and ponies freely.
