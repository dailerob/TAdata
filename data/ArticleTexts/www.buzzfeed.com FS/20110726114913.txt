President Obama is currently shopping around the Respect For Marriage Act which would repeal DOMA and give gay married couples equal rights. If you\u0027d like to help, you should contact your state representative and tell them to support the Respect For Marriage Act. Also share this. You can make a difference!

View Image ›Scientists trying to identify film clips that could “reliably elicit a strong emotional response” in the lab spent years testing hundreds of different clips on subjects only to discover that the secret lay in a young Ricky Schroder. So anyway, this is (officially and scientifically) the saddest scene in any movie ever. It\u0027s from 1979\u0027s The Champ and it has spoilers. Spoiler #1: It\u0027s sad as fuck. Add yours if you can think of something sadder. Are we going to let those meddling scientists tell us when to cry? Hell no.

A man named Richard Arrocho, screaming that someone was trying to kill him, climbed into the side window of the 5 train in New York and threatened to stab the conductor with a screwdriver. After wrestling with the conductor, Arrocho briefly commandeered the train. The conductor and some concerned passengers at first tried to lock Arrocho in the cabin, but then realizing they didn\u0027t want a crazy person potentially hurtling them to their doom, talked him out of the control room. Thankfully no one was hurt and Arrocho is in custody. Also thankfully, someone got all of this on video. (via nydailynews.com) View Media ›People have been dying in strange ways forever.
