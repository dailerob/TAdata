Sad pathetic boys are totally hot right now! We have a hard time believing that sensitive posterboys like Evan Dando and Conor Oberst ever had a problem getting laid.View the 12 Best LinksStyle Buzz The male model of today is \"an urchin, a wraith or an underfed runt.\" And those are the ones getting work. The New York Times reports on this disturbing trend.View the 5 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz Thinking about a lip injection? Celebrity duck lips are a foreboding PSA to not get your lips done. Whether they\u0027re shooting up in their arm or in their lips, it\u0027s never a good look.View the 10 Best LinksCelebrity Buzz The former Miss Nevada continues her downward spiral. Rees already had a place in our hearts by kicking off the beauty queen scandal trend by losing her crown back in 2006 after naughty photos of her surfaced online. Now she\u0027s doing the \"assaulting an officer\" thing, apparently trying to compete with Alycia Lane.View the 5 Best LinksStyle Buzz Three prominent designers (Marc Jacobs, Karen, Walker, Proenza Schouler) are showing giant neck bows on the fashion week runways. Jump on the giant neck bow look before it\u0027s all over the Forever 21 window displays (where fashion trends go to die).View the 10 Best LinksPolitics Buzz A ten-minute web film featuring a young Barack Obama, dance numbers and killing vampires. The plot of Barackula centers around Obama\u0027s time at the Harvard Law Review, when he comes under the spell of a group of vampire lawyers. Will he vanquish them? Political metaphor alert! Look for the film to debut sometime next few weeks.View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz Seniors in a Manchester suburb now have a place to let loose on equipment designed specifically for the 60-and-over set. All that\u0027s needed is an on-site nurse and an endless supply of butterscotch candies, and some may start thinking they\u0027ve died and gone to Heaven.View the 7 Best LinksTech Buzz A new cheap, tiny, highly anticipated notebook computer. Despite many delays, the lil\u0027 CloudBook (9 inches long, 2 pounds, only $399 and running the Linuxed-based gOS system) is poised to give the Asus Eee PC a run for its money.View the 6 Best LinksCulture Buzz Western money culture is producing an epidemic of horrible kids, although the specter of Paris Hilton is making some parents clamp down. There\u0027s been a lot of talk during the current election cycle about leaving a better America for the next generation, but if the next generation is just going to behave like the characters on Gossip Girl, maybe we should think again.View the 7 Best LinksMovie Buzz With Juno a huge box office success and now a multiple Oscar nominee, the haters are out in full force. Among their chief complaints: the film\u0027s treatment of pregnancy, its \"horribly precious\" soundtrack, and especially its arch lexicon. Seriously, honest to blog! But never fear, the backlash-to-the-backlash has already begun.View the 10 Best LinksScience Buzz You\u0027ve been made aware: your sunscreen is killing off the coral reef. Are coral reefs the new dolphins?View the 6 Best LinksCulture Buzz A modern American hookah invented by two college students turns any bottle of liquor into a portable, smokeable hookah. If smoking out of a hookah is your idea of party fun-time, then the hobohookah is for you! We prefer to actually drink that giant bottle of Jaeger.View the 9 Best LinksCulture Buzz The \"wine rack\"/\"cups runneth over\" jokes here are just too easy. Yes, it\u0027s a bra insert that allows you to drink from two small bags of booze through a straw. Given enough time, designers are sure to create every possible method of alcohol delivery, and we are waiting for Booze Shoes(TM) to appear. Update: Oops, we\u0027re too late.View the 4 Best LinksTech Buzz Some of the best videos of the web are removed over copyright claims. Here\u0027s the deal: Those \"overdubbed shred\" music videos we mentioned a few months ago, which are/were hilarious, have been pulled by YouTube, and Wired thinks it may all be Yngwie Malmsteen\u0027s fault. We\u0027ve found some similar (though not quite as brilliant) shred videos to tide you over until things get smoothed out.View the 11 Best LinksStyle Buzz Avant drop-crotch pants are the new skinny jeans. On one hand, you won\u0027t have to worry about wedgies, cameltoe, or visible panty lines. On the other, we can\u0027t imagine they\u0027d be flattering on any body type.View the 9 Best LinksMusic Buzz The all-lesbian Led Zeppelin tribute band will be playing this year\u0027s Bonnaroo music festival, leading to inevitable confusion. The Associated Press, NME and Chicago Sun Times (among others) got it wrong, thinking there was some sort of reunion happening. Oops! Happily, Lez Zeppelin really are the next-best thing, given that so few men have the range of the young Robert Plant.View the 6 Best LinksStyle Buzz Merge your minimalist aesthetic and your love of furry creatures with high-end pet homes. It\u0027s like Eames meets Iams.View the 5 Best LinksCulture Buzz We\u0027ve been noticing gum grafitti, gum sculptures, gum paintings. Some of this artwork is actually pretty incredible. We\u0027d rather the gum end up on some art gallery wall rather than the bottom of our shoes.View the 8 Best LinksScience Buzz The hypersonic A2 jet could take passengers at speeds up to 3,900 miles per hour. That\u0027s Mach 5 for those keeping score at home. Other impressive features: It runs on liquid hydrogen, it looks cool, the guy in charge of the project is named Mr. Bond. Downside: It won\u0027t be ready for the next 15-25 years.View the 4 Best LinksMusic Buzz Thao Nguyen and her band the Get Down Stay Down is getting tons of buzz (from Nina Garcia, even) for her brand of poppy folk and introspective lyrics. Her songs are surprisingly palatable for a Kill Rock Stars artist.

Bock\u0027s \"Beautiful Children,\" 11 years in the making, hit shelves a few weeks ago, and has gotten the rare Times treatment of a glowing review and Sunday Magazine profile. Needless to say, anonymous online commenters are mad about it.View the 7 Best LinksTech Buzz Just in time for Valentine\u0027s Day, Knicker Picker has launched an online store that lets you shop for your next piece of lingerie by dressing up (or down) a virtual panty model of your choosing.

Guess there\u0027s no longer a need for that sex slave we have coming over tonight.View the 5 Best LinksFood Buzz Innovative fast food technology let\u0027s you hold soda and chicken nuggets in one container. BBQ Chicken has launched what may be the greatest leap forward in fast food consumption since the McDLT (\"The hot stays hot! The cool stays cool!\") or maybe even the syrup-infused McGriddle. We predict the Chelsea location will sell out by the day\u0027s end.View the 6 Best LinksTV Buzz A fake feud between the three TV personalities over who \"made Mike Huckabee\" reaches its [supposed] end.

The date is so overdetermined that IHOP has broken tradition and declared next Tuesday to be National Pancake Day. Purists are sticking to the usual date since it\u0027s intended to be a part of the beginning of Lent.
