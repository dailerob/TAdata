Memoli | 3:25 p.m. Tonight\u0027s speech by the GOP nominee, seen above earlier today, is viewed as a pivotal moment for his campaign. Photos | Video Critics comb Ryan speech, but is anyone listening? Texas voter ID law voided Fox News gets a third of GOP convention viewers Quotes from the convention: Interesting take on working mothers in Ann Romney\u0027s speech: sympathy mixed with the view that women are primary nurturers. ” @MichaelMcGough3 Romney is a rich man whose policies often sound -- to many voters, anyway -- aimed at helping job creators more than job holders. ” — Doyle McManus More Latinos have spoken at #GOP2012 tonight than are probably watching the convention on TV. ” @jcahealey [Ann Romney] also came up with a very strong line that is likely to be heard again in the campaign: \"This man will not fail.\" ” — David Horsey .@AnnDRomney \"I\u0027m still in love with that boy I met at a high-school dance, and he still makes me laugh.\" Effect and cause. #GOP2012 ” @jcahealey \"Mitt Romney was not handed success, he BUILT it.\" Excellent applause line. ” @davidhorsey Is it just me, or is Christie being as vague and nonspecific as... well... Mitt Romney? ” @DanTurner18 Apparently every Republican on the stage this year had a dad or grandfather who was a truck driver or a miner... except Romney. ” @davidhorsey \"We must continue to welcome the world\u0027s most ambitious people...\" That\u0027s the best statement I\u0027ve heard at this convention. #GOP2012 ” @newton_jim Rice on failing schools: \"This is the civil rights issue of our day.\" So true, and an issue that should cross party lines. #GOP2012 ” @newton_jim \"The biggest threat to Medicare is Obamacare and we\u0027re going to stop it.\" It may be untrue, but that will be a clever attack line. ” @davidhorsey Wow, @PaulRyanVP calls out George W. Bush for spending too much. #GOP2012 ” @jcahealey The image of college graduates in their rooms looking at \"fading Obama posters\" is pretty great. #GOP2012 ” @newton_jim Medical parole for county inmates approved By Patrick McGreevy State lawmakers passed the measure allowing release if inmates are medically incapacitated. It was requested by L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca.
