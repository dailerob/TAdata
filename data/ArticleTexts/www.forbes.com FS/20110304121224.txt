Videoconferencing. An HDMI video out for corporate presentations. These represented the grand total of what could charitably be labeled as new enterprise features in the iPad 2. Though that requires you to stretch the definition of enterprise as much as a pair of bicycle tights on a sumo wrestler. [More...] In fact, you could argue that some of the iPad 2\u0027s new features would actually put off enterprises, as IDC analyst Bob O\u0027Donnell did. \"\"There was nothing specific there for the enterprise. Indeed, some companies don\u0027t want the new cameras because of privacy and security concerns.\" I won\u0027t go that far. But I will argue that Apple, as is its wont, basically chose not to devote its engineering prowess on the enterprise front. No encryption - as the iPhone has; no improvements to iTunes for easier enterprise security and management; no \"true multitasking,\" as analyst Jack Gold argued. Not that it will matter - my prediction is that adoption of the iPad by businesses will only accelerate from its impressive debut year (80% of Fortune 100 testing/deploying, 366 documented mass rollouts). Why? Let\u0027s go through my list - oh how I love my lists - of reasons: 1) The Bring Your Own Device phenomenon. According to IDC, half of the iPads used at work are being brought in as individually-owned devices. The other half are being deployed by organizations who have calculated that the productivity gains from equipping executives, salespeople, business analysts and others with iPads outweigh the inability to lock them down with hundreds of group policies, the typical overkill on a corporate PC. 2) It\u0027s the software, stupid. IT knows that any meaningful upgrade to the iPad\u0027s enterprise-worthiness will be delivered via improvements in iOS. iOS 4 released at last year\u0027s WWDC was huge because it opened up lots of APIs for third-party vendors to add their own enterprise and security controls. Speaking of the ecosystem... 3) The iOS ecosystem is hu-uge. Besides Sybase and our mobile device management and app development platform, there are plenty of competing firms (though our position is that most of those are less integrated solutions that will, for large or growing firms, create more cost in the long run). There are even plenty of firms solving one of the iPad\u0027s less-obvious but nagging problems - its lack of enterprise storage capability, such as the ability to connect natively with SharePoint. Turns out there are plenty of vendors offering solutions. 4) Low price. As widely noted, the iPad starts at a significantly lower price ($499, not including the temporary $399 price for the original iPad) than its rivals, and not just the unapologetically enterprise-oriented rivals like the Cisco Cius. That\u0027s important because, as noted, half of the iPads in business use today are being brought in by consumers. So even if IT is not particularly price-conscious, consumers are. 5) Apps. I\u0027ve always found that my satisfaction from a restaurant meal can be expressed by this formula: Tastiness + Portion Size + My Hunger At That Moment / Price \u003d Satisfaction If I were to create a similar formula for user satisfaction for a tablet, it might look like something like this: Hardware Sexiness + User Interface + Apps / Upfront Price + (Long-term Cost of Ownership, i.e. mobile subscription / 2) \u003d Satisfaction The point here is that apps matter, both the quality and the quantity. Apple wins hands-down on both counts. --------------- Do you buy my argument that iPad\u0027s enterprise uptake this year won\u0027t be a function of its enterprise features?Game Theory Of The NFL Negotiations: Expect More ExtensionsHouse GOP Budget Proposal Would Stifle Energy InnovationAmylin Loses A Quarter Of Its Value In A DayDow Surges Nearly 200 Points Led By Caterpillar, BofAGoldman Ups Apple Estimate On iPad 2 OptimismMarvell Q4 Misses; Nicked By BlackBerry, Disk Drive TroublesApple Will Refund $100 To Anyone Who Just Bought An iPadHuawei Holding 10-Year U.S. Anniversary Event To Refine ReputationMy Dad: Lessons in how NOT to own a Small BusinessTwitter Says No IPO Plans, No Need For More CapitalWalt Bettinger\u0027s big moves drew RIABiz readers in FebruaryWhat Can We Do About the Pirates?You Call It Inflation, I Call It TheftFallout From \u0027Days of Rage\u0027 In Middle EastSign of Times: More Tech Jobs, Salary FlatHow Dior, Galliano and the iPad 2 Reinforce the Need for Businesses to Look Good NakedWhy You\u0027ll See Adobe Embracing Apple\u0027s iPadGDC In PicturesWith Lockout Looming, NFL Math Does Not Add UpCharlie Sheen: Don\u0027t Make Him an American IdolBeyonce And Mariah Carey Give Away Qadaffi\u0027s MoneyFamily Dollar A Risky Play After Rejecting PeltzWhat Sort Of Woman Would Marry Charlie Sheen?Do International Crises Mean Time To Panic, Or Time To Profit?Muni Talks: Roubini And Lehmann Say Get Out Of Municipal Bonds#1Bill Gates#2Warren Buffett#130Oprah Winfrey#35Mark Zuckerberg#42Steve Jobs#10Michael Bloomberg#2Bill Gates#1Carlos Slim Helú#4Mukesh Ambani#117Rupert Murdoch#7Bernard Arnault#14Li Ka-shing#4Lady Gaga#2Beyonce Knowles#5Tiger Woods#9Johnny Depp#29Roger Federer#60Cameron Diaz#47 Johnson \u0026 Johnson#75 Apple#1JPMorgan Chase#2General Electric#15Berkshire Hathaway#36NestléGallery: The Hottest New Technologies Of 2011Gallery: 10 Reasons Financial Advisors Fire ClientsGallery: The Next Wave of Green CarsThe Future Of Selling: It\u0027s SocialTop RIAs: Biggest, Fastest Growing And Up-And-Coming","h5":"","h6":"","tr":"FEB MAR APR 4 2010 2011 2012 21,568 captures 4 Nov 96 - 3 Sep 16 Close HelpFEB MAR APR 4 2010 2011 2012FEB MAR APR42010 2011 201221,568 captures 4 Nov 96 - 3 Sep 16","article":"How Much Is China\u0027s Sina Weibo Worth?
