Listen Loading Playing… 3 min 48 sec Filed Under Economy Comments Facebook TwitterHide caption Sami Younes, 26, began his physical transition three years ago. \"Transition didn\u0027t solve everything for me. I still have a lot of growing to do as person. But I think I\u0027m in a better position to face it now,\" he said. One of the things that Younes navigates now is how people react to him as a transgender Lebanese and Puerto Rican man. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption Younes holds a senior portrait picture of himself in high school when he was formerly Miriam. Being beautiful equated to becoming a good daughter in Younes\u0027 experiences with his family. \"All I knew was that I was a girl and I had to be a girl and inside, I didn\u0027t feel that way,\" he said. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption Younes relaxes in the morning with one of his cats, Beans, at home. He shares an apartment with a roommate, Angelica Martinez. As a Lebanese and Puerto Rican transgender man, Younes has yet to find somebody like himself. He has attempted to form social groups for trans men of color but they never successfully materialized. \"I do feel a bit alone,\" Younes said. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption Younes drives in D.C. to meet his parents for lunch. Initially apprehensive about his transition, Younes\u0027 parents are now supportive of him as their son. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption Younes talks with a current intern and Harriet Lesser, the 2012-2013 season curator, at The Mansion at Strathmore during work. He previously interned at the gallery when he was female and had a smooth transition when he returned. He was a visual arts assistant there but has since changed jobs. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption A flier for a production of The Tempest hangs on Younes\u0027 refrigerator. He will play the part of Alonso with the DNA Theatre in Baltimore. After his transition, theater became a big part of Younes\u0027 life, a way for him to express himself and socialize with other people. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption Younes rehearses a scene for The Tempest with his castmates at St. Mark\u0027s Evangelical Church in Baltimore. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption Younes participates in theater rehearsal. Most of the people he interacts with know of his transition, but there are several people who he knows may not. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption Younes lets Paul Roe, owner and artist at Britishink Tattoos in Washington, D.C., outline his body for a preliminary tattoo design. Younes plans to receive a fairly elaborate tattoo, including a lion and a sun, that will cover the majority of his body. The lion and the sun are two symbols often used in Iranian culture and have ties to Islam. Younes\u0027 middle name, Haidar, also means lion. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption Younes dresses for work in the morning. He says that while telling his story will be his way of putting himself out there, that doesn\u0027t make it \"open season\" for strangers to bluntly ask about personal things like his sexuality. \"Everyone\u0027s got a different story. There\u0027s no cut and dry mold for being transgender,\" he said. Previous Next Erica Yoon/NPR Hide caption Younes celebrates his birthday with Martinez and several of their friends at their apartment on a Saturday night.
