Before the release of water from the Morelos dam, Jacobsen described this parched riverbed as a trench, with big stretches of it bone-dry. Previous Next Courtesy Fred Phillips Hide caption Jacobsen paddles through the Colorado River just above San Luis, Mexico, 17 miles below the Moreno dam. The release of water from the dam created a \"pulse flow\" that temporarily restored the river that used to flow here. Now, three months afterward, it\u0027s dry once more. In the absence of the river\u0027s flow, this region\u0027s native habitats have been replaced by invasive salt cedar.
