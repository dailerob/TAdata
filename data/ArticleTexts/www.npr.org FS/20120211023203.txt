Yellowstone National Park officials say restrictions on hunting in portions of Montana has protected the park\u0027s wolves from a repeat of a 2009 hunt in which four Yellowstone wolves were shot.Back from near-extinction, the gray wolf now numbers more than 1,600 and will soon be removed from the Endangered Species List. Wyoming has struck a deal with the federal government to allow trophy hunting of the predator in certain parts of the state. But the move has drawn the ire of environmentalists, who worry that hunting will be permitted on national parkland.On All Things ConsideredPlaylistThe 2011 \u0027Photo Of The Year\u0027They Know You\u0027re Reading ThisHow My Voice Went SilentScheming Parents Set Their Kids Up — And It WorksNPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR SponsorSaved From Extinction, Darwin\u0027s Crocs Are Now King\u0027Situation Could Not Be More Dire,\u0027 Syrians In Besieged City SayHow Two Bitter Adversaries Hatched A Plan To Change The Egg BusinessA Spy On The Run, But Playing It Too \u0027Safe\u0027\u0027Chico And Rita\u0027 And All That Jazz\u0027The Turin Horse\u0027: The Abyss Gazes Implacably BackPlay The QuizGeorge Clooney On Acting, Fame, And Putting Down Your Cell Phone CameraColonial History, Through The Eyes Of The ColonizedSharon Van Etten In Concert WXPNWho Says Classical Music Can\u0027t Be Sexy?Why \u0027The Voice\u0027 Rules Over \u0027Idol\u0027 (At Least Right Now)Discover 13 Jazz Legends In The MakingLeala Cyr And Ricardo Vogt In Concert WBGODoes The 2011 \u0027Photo Of The Year\u0027 Look Familiar?At CPAC, Gingrich Takes Aim At \u0027Republican Establishment\u0027How Two Bitter Adversaries Hatched A Plan To Change The Egg BusinessC-Section Delivery May Be Risky For Smaller PreemiesWhy We Like What We Like","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"newsarts \u0026 lifeOdd news from the world of manufacturing this week.
