Gabriel Centella Damian wrestles as an Exótico — campy male, mostly gay, professional wrestlers — under the stage name Pasión Kristal. Despite their makeup and feminine clothes, Exóticos are some of the best wrestlers. Previous Next Daniela Herrerías for NPR Hide caption A match mesmerizes the audience, which comes in all ages. There are often chants for the wrestlers to kiss as soon as they enter the ring. Previous Next Daniela Herrerías for NPR Hide caption Pasión Kristal walks toward the ring.
