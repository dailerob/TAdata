Filed Under Music Tiny Desk Concerts Music Videos Comments Facebook TwitterHide caption Pasión Kristal performs a signature move on an opponent in Magdalena Culhuacán, on the outskirts of Mexico City. Gabriel Centella Damian wrestles as an Exótico — campy male, mostly gay, professional wrestlers — under the stage name Pasión Kristal. Despite their makeup and feminine clothes, Exóticos are some of the best wrestlers. Previous Next Daniela Herrerías for NPR Hide caption A match mesmerizes the audience, which comes in all ages. There are often chants for the wrestlers to kiss as soon as they enter the ring. Previous Next Daniela Herrerías for NPR Hide caption Pasión Kristal walks toward the ring. Damian\u0027s career began when he asked to train as a luchador in a gym and was beat up. He returned the next day, and this time, they let him stay and learn. Previous Next Daniela Herrerías for NPR Hide caption Filmmaker Michael Ramos admits the stereotyping Exóticos revel in is problematic. Exóticos\u0027 overt homosexuality generally serves as comic relief. The fight at Magdalena Culhuacán opened with Exótico Juana La Loca, who warmed up the crowd strutting, blowing kisses and flirting with his opponent. Previous Next Daniela Herrerías for NPR Hide caption Although his flamboyancy often overshadows his wrestling skills, like most Exóticos, Juana La Loca is an excellent wrestler that both gay and straight fans admire for his technique.
